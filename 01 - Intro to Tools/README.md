# 01 - Intro to Tools

In this lab session we have first explored [Trifacta Wrangler](https://www.trifacta.com/products/wrangler/),
a desktop tool to easily visualize and transform data. You can [download it for free](https://www.trifacta.com/start-wrangling/).

As test datasets, we first used the list of student exported by IS-Academia as an Excel file
(which unfortunately I cannot release for privacy reasons). Then we moved to a larger CSV dataset about 
[gunshot deaths](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/gun-deaths/) featured by [fivethirtyeight.com](http://fivethirtyeight.com/).
You can find the raw data in their [GitHub repository](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/guns-data). For the live demo,
we used the `full_data.csv` file.

In the second part of the lab we explored the functionalities of the IPython Notebooks. The most user friendly distribution
of the IPython Notebooks is [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/anaconda-overview) (especially for Data Science tasks).
You can [download it for free](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), and it's available for Windows, Mac and Linux.
In this repository you can find the notebook we used during the lab (credits to [saloot](https://github.com/saloot)).
