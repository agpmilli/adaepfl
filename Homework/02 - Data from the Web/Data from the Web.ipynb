    "## Background\n",
    "In this homework we will extract interesting information from [IS-Academia](http://is-academia.epfl.ch/page-6228.html), the educational\n",
    "portal of EPFL. Specifically, we will focus on the part that allows [public access to academic data](http://is-academia.epfl.ch/publicaccess-Bachelor-Master).\n",
    "The list of registered students by section and semester is not offered as a downloadable dataset, so you will have to find a way to scrape the\n",
    "information we need. On [this form](http://isa.epfl.ch/imoniteur_ISAP/%21gedpublicreports.htm?ww_i_reportmodel=133685247) you can select\n",
    "the data to download based on different criteria (e.g., year, semester, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "You are not allowed to download manually all the tables -- rather you have to understand what parameters the server accepts, and\n",
    "generate accordingly the HTTP requests. For this task, [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com) with the [Interceptor extension](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/capture)\n",
    "can help you greatly. I recommend you to watch this [brief tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBjXVrS8nXs&list=PLM-7VG-sgbtD8qBnGeQM5nvlpqB_ktaLZ&autoplay=1)\n",
    "to understand quickly how to use it.\n",
    "Your code in the iPython Notebook should not contain any hardcoded URL. To fetch the content from the IS-Academia server,\n",
    "you can use the [Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) library with a Base URL, but all the other form parameters\n",
    "should be extracted from the HTML with [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/).\n",
    "You can choose to download Excel or HTML files -- they both have pros and cons, as you will find out after a quick check. You can also\n",
    "choose to download data at different granularities (e.g., per semester, per year, etc.) but I recommend you not to download all the data\n",
    "in one shot because 1) the requests are likely to timeout and 2) we will overload the IS-Academia server.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assignment\n",
    "We will focus exclusively on the academic unit `Informatique`. When asked, select the right [statistical test](http://hamelg.blogspot.ch/2015/11/python-for-data-analysis-part-24.html).\n",

    "1. Obtain all the data for the Bachelor students, starting from 2007. Keep only the students for which you have an entry for both `Bachelor\n",
    "semestre 1` and `Bachelor semestre 6`. Compute how many months it took each student to go from the first to the sixth semester. Partition\n",
    "the data between male and female students, and compute the average -- is the difference in average statistically significant?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Perform a similar operation to what described above, this time for Master students. Notice that this data is more tricky, as there are\n",
    "many missing records in the IS-Academia database. Therefore, try to guess how much time a master student spent at EPFL by at least checking\n",
    "the distance in months between `Master semestre 1` and `Master semestre 2`. If the `Mineur` field is *not* empty, the student should also\n",
    "appear registered in `Master semestre 3`. Last but not the least, don't forget to check if the student has an entry also in the `Projet Master`\n",
    "tables. Once you can handle well this data, compute the \"average stay at EPFL\" for master students. Now extract all the students with a \n",
    "`Spécialisation` and compute the \"average stay\" per each category of that attribute -- compared to the general average, can you find any\n",
    "specialization for which the difference in average is statistically significant?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. *BONUS*: perform the gender-based study also on the Master students, as explained in 1. Use scatterplots to visually identify changes\n",
    "over time. Plot males and females with different colors -- can you spot different trends that match the results of your statistical tests?\n",
