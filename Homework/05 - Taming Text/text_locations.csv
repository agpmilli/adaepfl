Anne-Marie Slaughter is a professor of politics and international affairs at Princeton.
By Anne-Marie Slaughter
PRESIDENT Obama says the noose is tightening around Col. Muammar al-Qaddafi. In fact, it is
tightening around the Libyan rebels, as Colonel Qaddafi makes the most of the world's dithering and
steadily retakes rebel-held tow.ns, The United States and Europe are temporizing on a no-flight zone
while the Organization of the Islamic Conference, the Gulf Cooperation Council and now the Arab
League have all called on the United Nations Security Council to authorize one. Opponents of a no-
flight zone have put forth five main arguments, none of which, on closer examination, hold up.
It's not in our interest. Gen. Wesley K. Clark argues that ""Libya doesn't sell much oil to the United
States"" and that while Americans ""want to support democratic movements in the region,"" they are
already doing that in Iraq and Afghanistan. Framing this issue in terms of oil is exactly what Arab
populations and indeed much of the world expect, which is why they are so cynical about our
professions of support for democracy and human rights. Now we have a chance to support a new
beginning in the Muslim world — a new beginning of accountable governments that can provide
services and opportunities for their citizens in ways that could dramatically decrease support for
terrorist groups and violent extremism. It's hard to imagine something more in our strategic interest.
It will be counter-productive. Many thoughtful commentators, including Al Jazeera's director
general, Wadah Khanfar, argue that what is most important about the Arab spring is that it is coming
from Arabs themselves. From this perspective, Western military intervention will play right into
Qaddati's hands, allowing him to broadcast pictures of Western bombs falling on Arab civilians. But
these arguments, while important, must be weighed against the appeals of of Libyan opposition
fighters asking for international help, and now, astonishingly, against support for a no-flight zone by
some of the same governments that have kept their populations quiescent by holding up the specter of
foreign intervention. Assuming that a no-flight zone can be imposed by an international coalition that
includes Arab states, we have an opportunity to establish a new narrative of Western support for Arab
democrats.

It won't work. The United States ambassador to NATO, Ivo H. Daaider, argues that stopping
Colonel Qaddafi's air force will not be decisive; he will continue to inflict damage with tanks and
helicopters, bombing oil refineries and depots on his way to retaking key towns. But the potential
effect of a no-flight zone must also be assessed in terms of Colonel Qaddafi's own calculations about
his future. Richard Downie of the Center for Strategic and International Studies argues that although
Colonel Qaddafi cultivates a mad-dictator image, he has been a canny survivor and political
manipulator for 40 years. He is aware of debates with regard to a no-flight zone and is timing his
military campaign accordingly; he is also capable of using his air force just enough to gain strategic
advantage, but not enough to trigger a no-flight zone. If the international community lines up against
him and is willing to crater his runways and take out his antiaircraft weapons, he might well renew his
offer of a negotiated departure.
If it does work, we don't know what we will get. Revolutions are almost always followed by internal
divisions among the revolutionaries. We should not expect a rosy, Jeffersonian Libya. But the choice
is between uncertainty and the certainty that if Colonel Qaddafi wins, regimes acrosS the region will
conclude that force is the livay to answer protests. And when Colonel Qaddafi massacres the
opposition, young protesters across the Middle East will conclude that when we were asked to support
their cause with more than words, we blinked. Americans in turn will read the words of Mr. Obama's
June 2009 speech in Cairo., with its lofty promises to stand for universal human rights, and cringe.
Let's arm the rebels instead. Some commentators who agree with the analysis above say we could
'better accomplish our goals by providing intelligence and arms to the opposition. That would, of
course, be much easier for us. It undoubtedly appeals to Mn Obama as a neat compromise between
the desire to help the protesters and the desire not to overrule his defense secretary's reluctance to
participate in a no-flight zone. But we would be providing arms not to a disciplined military, but to
ragged groups of brave volunteers who barely know how to use the weapons they have. They need
action that will change the situation on. the ground for Colonel Qaddafi, as well as his the calculations.
Moreover, by the time arms and intelligence could take effect, it is quite likely that Colonel Qaddafi
will have retaken or at least besieged .Benghazi, the opposition stronghold.
The United States should immediately ask the Security Council to authorize a no-flight zOne and
make clear to Russia and China that if they block the resolution, the blood of the Libyan opposition
will be on their hands. We should push them at least to abstain and bring the issue to a vote as soon as
possible. If we get a resolution, we should work with the Arab League to quickly assemble an
international coalition to impose the no-flight zone. If the Security Council fails toact, then we should
recognize the opposition Interim National Council as the legitimate Libyan government, as France has
done, and work with the Arab League to give the council any assistance it requests:

Any use of force must be carefully and fully debated, but that debate has now been had. Ifs been

How Our Words Unite, Divide, and Define a Nation,"" is a regular CNN Belief Blog contributor.

What should we make of the attacks on the U.S. consulates in Egypt, Libya and Yemen, and the deaths of
four Americans, including U.S. ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens?
It depends on who you mean by ""we.""
From the perspective of those who stormed the embassies, taking down the American flag in Egypt and
replacing it with a black flag reading, ""There is no God but Allah and Mohammed is his messenger,"" theirs was
an act of justice on behalf of the One True Faith.
The Americans had it coming, according to this view, because Americans are on the wrong side in the clash of
civilizations between the Judeo-Christian West and the Muslim world. And the creation of an anti-Islamic video
(ironically entitled ""Innocence of Muslims"") by a producer thought to be an American provided the catalyst
(or excuse) for the protests.
Why Muslims are sensitive about portraying the Prophet Mohammed
Most Americans operate by a different ""we."" From our perspective, the assault was an unjust and cowardly
attack on (among other things) the rule of law, the institution of diplomacy and the right of free speech.
Libyan Deputy Prime Minister Mustafa Abushagur gave voice to this perspective when he said on Twitter, ""I
condemn these barbaric attacks in the strongest possible terms. This is an attack on America, Libya and free
people everywhere.""
""Some have sought to justify this vicious behavior as a response to inflammatory material posted on the
Internet,"" Secretary of State Hillary Clinton added. ""The United States deplores any intentional effort to
denigrate the religious beliefs of others. Our commitment to religious tolerance goes back to the very beginning
of our nation.""
In a commencement speech at Kenyon College in 2005, later published as""This Is Water,"" novelist David
Foster Wallace urged student to scrutinize the ""natural, basic self-centeredness"" that puts ""me"" at the center of
the world.
This unconscious ""default setting"" fosters the sort of ""blind certainty"" that manifests as arrogant atheism and
fundamentalism alike, Wallace said. And the point of education is to shake us out of that ""default setting"" — to
begin to see things from the perspectives of others.

Wallace focused in his speech on the individual ""I."" But his critique can be applied as well to another ""default

Give:5
According to those who stormed the embassies, ""Innocence of Muslims"" was not made by an individual
(whoever the shadowy ""Sam Bacile"" may — or may not — be). It was made by anAmerican.
Moreover, according to this groupthink, Americans as a group are responsible for the sins of individual
Americans, so it makes perfect sense to strike out at embassy personnel who issued a statement before the
protests turned deadly, condemning ""the continuing efforts by misguided individuals to hurt the religious
feelings of Muslims, as we condemn efforts to offend believers of all religions.""
CNN's Belief Blog: The faith angles behind the biggest stories
Meanwhile, the shadowy figures who produced and distributed ""Innocence of Muslims"" are imprisoned in some
groupthink of their own, which gathers all the world's Muslims under the category of an evil Islamic empire.
Their film doesn't just depict Mohammed as a con man, philanderer, and pedophile. It portrays his followers as
dupes.
Unfortunately, the events of recent days have done nothing to jar the alleged producer out of this default setting.
When questioned about his film in the aftermath of the Libyan and Egyptian attacks, a man identifying himself
as ""Sam Bacile"" reportedly told the Wall Street Journal that ""Islam is a cancer.""
You don't need a Kenyon college degree to see how this vicious cycle of provocation and violence is fueled,
and you don't need to be a moral relativist to see that it takes two sides to keep it running.
I am an American who is justly proud of the First Amendment and its protections of freedom of speech and
religion. And I believe that killing your opponents in the name of God or nation is a far greater offense than
offending them with an ignorant movie.
Nonetheless, the root problem on display here is in my view what Wallace denounced as ""blind certainty.""
Our world is not divided first and foremost along religious or national lines, into Muslims and Christians and
Hindus or Israelis and Americans and Egyptians.
Neither is it divided into secularists and people of faith — the New Atheists and partisans of old-time religion.
The real ""red line"" in the modem world divides the certain from the uncertain. And in the tragic events of recent
days, those who produced and distributed this hateful movie stand on the same side of this line as the killers of
innocents in Libya and Egypt.
Both groups are possessed by the unholy spirit of ""blind certainty,"" unacquainted with both the complexity and
contradictions of life on Earth and the ""cloud of unknowing"" that hovers over every major religion.
The great religious thinkers in Judaism, Christianity and Islam always knew enough to know that they did not
know everything.
They knew the difference between the eternal decrees of the God of Abraham and the all-too-flawed thoughts of
ordinary people. They knew, in short, that they are not God, who alone is charged with creating and destroying
the world and discriminating along the way between the real and the illusory.
The killers in Libya have forgotten that. So have the not-so-innocent producers and distributors of Innocence
of Islam.""
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Stephen Prothero.

Re: Lots of new Intel; Libyan army possibly on verge of collapse
Latest:
During the evening of March 27, 2011, individuals with direct access to the military committee of the National
Libyan Council (NLC) stated in confidence that while the rebel forces continue to have organization and
communications problems, their morale has improved drastically, and they believe the Libyan Army is on the
verge of collapse. Under attack from allied Air and Naval forces, the Libyan Army troops have begun to desert
to the rebel side in increasing numbers. The rebels are making an effort togeet these troops as fellow Libyans,
in an effort to encourage additional defections.
(Source Comment: Speaking in strict confidence, one rebel commander stated that his troops continue to
summarily execute all foreign mercenaries captured in the fighting. At the same time Colonel Khalifa Haftzu•
has reportedly joined the rebel command structure, in an effort to help organization the rebel forces. Haftar was
the commander of the Libyan National Army ([NA), a 1500 man force of anti-Qaddafi troops based in
N'djamena, Chad, until current President Idryss Debi overthrew Chadian President Hussein Habre in the fall of
1990, with the assistance of Libyan and French troops. Haftar and his troops lied to a cotaatry in central Africa
and many, including Haftar, later settled in the United States.)
An extremely sensitive source added that the rebels are receiving direct assistance and training from a small
number of Egyptian Special Forces units, while French and British Special Operations troops are working out of
bases in Egypt, along the Libyan border. These troops are overseeing the transfer of weapons and supplies to
the rebels.

(Source Comment: The rebels are moving back into 'areas that they lost in mid- March fighting, and using the
allied air cover, they are confident they can move into the Tripoli district in a matter of days. One rebel source
reported that they had reliable intelligence that people were evacuating Qaddafi's hometown, Sirte, anticipating
its capture by the rebels. Sirte is located mid-way between Tripoli and Benghazi; its loss will be a
psychological blow for Qaddall.)
Separately, a sensitive European source stated in strict confidence that French military commanders anticipate a
complete collapse of the Libyan military command and control structure in the next week. These officers, who
have experience with the Libyan Army during its invasion of Chad in the late 1980s stated that the Libyan
troops did not perform well under concentrated fire from troops armed with modern weapons.
This source also noted that information from Tripoli has become increasingly difficult to obtain, but there are
reports of deaths among some Qaddafi's senior security officials, including Mansour Daw, and that the Libyan
leader himself may have experienced a health problem. Unfortunately, the European Intelligence services have
been unable to confirm or discredit these reports. This situation has become increasingly frustrating for French
President Nicolas Sarkozy, who, according to knowledgeable individuals, is pressing to have France emerge
from this crisis as the principal foreign ally of any new government that takes power.
Sarkozy is also concerned about continuing reports that radical/terrorist groups such as the Libyan Fighting
Groups and Al Qa'ida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) are infiltrating the NLC. and its military command.
Accordingly, he asked sociologist who has long established ties to Israel, Syria, and other B6
nations in the Middle East, to use his contacts to determine the level of influence AQIM and other terrorist
groups have inside of the NLC. Sarkozy also asked for reports setting out a clear picture of the role of the
Muslim Brotherhood in the rebel leadership.
These sources note that French diplomats and intelligence officers in Egypt are in contact with the following
rebel figures in Benghazi:
MESMAR1Nouri (Qaddafi's former head of protocol, who along with Mousa Kousa was considered the Libyan
leaders most loyal follower. Noun currently lives in France;

CHARRA.NT Faraj,
BOUKHRIS Fathi,
General Abdelfateh Younis (commander of the rebel forces)
(Source Comment: Senior European security officials caution that AQIM is watching developments in Libya,
and elements of that organization have been in touch with tribes in the southeastern part of the country. These
officials are concerned that in a post-Qaddafi Libya, France and other western European countries must move
quickly to ensure that the new government does not allow AQUA and others to set up small, semi- autonomous
local entities—or ""Caliphates""—in the oil and gas producing regions of southeastern Libya.)
These knowledgeable sources add that the insurgents have the following weapons stockpiled in Benghazi:
82 and 120 mm. mortars;

12.7mm. machine guns mounted on 4x4 vehicles;

GOP's October surprise?
They're calling it the ""Jimmy Carter Strategy"": Exploit
Libya attack to paint Obama as weak on terrorism
By cY'aia?,_
(Credit: AP/AI Behrman/Salort)
According to a highly reliable source, as Mitt Romney and President Barack Obama prepare for the
first presidential debate Wednesday night, top Republican operatives are primed to unleash a new
two-pronged offensive that will attack Obama as weak on national security, and will be based, in part,
on inW !ia:en,y-.3iTeForrnation regarding the attacks in Libya that killed U.S. ambassador Chris
Stevens on September
The source, who has first-hand knowledge of private, high-level conversations in the Romney tamp
that took place in Washington, DC last week, said that at various times the GOP strategists referred to
their new operation as the Jimmy Carter Strategy or the October Surprise.
He added that they planned to release what they hoped would be ""a bombshell"" that would make
Libya and Obama's foreign policy a major issue in the campaign. ""My understanding is that they have
come up with evidence that the Obama administration had positive intelligence that there was going
to be a terrorist attack on the intelligence.""
The source described the Republicans as chortling with glee that the Obama administration
""definitely had intel"" about the attack before it happened. ""Intelligence can be graded in different
ways,"" he added, ""and sometimes A and B don't get connected. But [the Romney campaign] will try to
paint it to look like Obama had advance knowledge of the attack and is weak on terrorism.""
He said they were jubilant about their new strategy and said they intended to portray Obama as a
helpless, Jimmy Carter-like president and to equate the tragedy in Libya with President Carter's failed
attempt to rescue American hostages in Iran in t980. ""They are so excited about it,"" he said. ""Over
and over again they talked about bow it would be just like Jimmy Carter's failed raid. They feel it is
going to give them .a last-minute landslide in the election.""
The source, however, said lie was dubious about the tactic. ""To me, it is indicative that they have lost
touch with a huge portion of the electorate,"" he said.
The source declined to reveal the names of the GOP operatives who were present. But he said, ""These
were the top guys in the party. It was a .private, unguarded planning conversation."" He further

described participants in the meeting as consisting of well-known names tied to the big Republican
super PACs and people who had access to high-level national security intelligence.
""As usual, Karl Rove wasn't present,"" he said, ""but some were close to Rove.""
The source said that ""there was quite a bit more"" to the operation than simply revealing the
intelligence regarding Libya. He declined to discuss what he described as the second phase of the
operation.
However, already there is evidence that the first phase of the operation is underway. On Wednesday,
September 26, on Fox News, Karl Rove called Obama's reaction to what happened in Libya
""inexplicable"" and added that Obama is ""more intent on campaigning than meeting his
responsibilities as commander-in-chief."" He went on to warn that Obama's policies in Libya
endangered the U.S. with regard to Iran. ""I am astonished,"" Rove said. ""We are projecting weakness
when we need to be projecting strength.""
Similarly, former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, a one-time GOP presidential hopeful who
became known as the mayor of 9/11, followed Rove in criticizing Obama on the attack in Libya. ""This
is a deliberate attempt to cover up the truth, from an administration that claimed it wanted to be the
most transparent in history,"" he told Fox News. ""And it's the worst kind of cover-up: the kind of
cover-up that involves our national security. This is a cover-up that involves the slaughter of four
Americans.""
Giuliani added that the Obama White House wanted to dismiss the role played by al-Qaeda because it
seemed to diminish the triumph of having killed Osama bin Laden. ""I think it's because they have this
narrative that they defeated al-Qaeda,"" he said. ""They never say the words 'Islamic fundamentalist
terrorism'. They want to wish it away. The president was moving on to Asia — he was going to declare
this a great victory for himself and unfortunately, this terrible act of terror intervened in their very
convenient narrative.""
Likewise, Bob Corker, Republican senator from Tennessee, described the administration's response to
""the terrorist attack"" in Libya as And on Sunday, September 30, both Mitt Romney and
vice-presidential nominee Paul Ryan joined in the attacks. ""I think they want to do their very best to
keep the people of America from understanding exactly what happened. We expect candor, we expect
transparency, particularly as it relates to terrorism,"" Romney said.
Added Ryan, ""Why is he (Obama) not on the same page with his own administration officials who are
saying that this is a terrorist attack? We'll leave it up to you to decide whether it's a cover-up or not.""
In an apparently related development, a Politico artkle posted last night said Romney advisers were
divided over hovv aggressively to attack President Obama over his handling of the events in Libya. One
unnamed Romney adviser described them as ""a huge gift"" to the campaign. ""Across the board —
domestic, economic and foreign-policy issues — President Obama has been outmatched by events,"" he
said. ""He's an observer of events, not a shaper of events. Everywhere you look, he's been outmatched.""
But other Romney advisers, led by media strategist Stuart Stevens, wanted to stick to the economy as
the central issue. ""They'll tell you that you've got to focus people on the fact that their economic
prospects are not very good and all that,"" the aide told Politico. ""Well, Romney's been trying to do that
now since he clinched the nomination at the end of April — and he's failed. The president is better at
deflecting attention from the bad news than Romney is at driving home the impact of the bad news on
individual voters.""

Mitt Romney: A New Course for the Middle East
Restore the three sinews of American influence: our economic strength, our military strength and the strength of our values.
Disturbing developments are sweeping across the greater Middle East. In Syria, tens of thousands of innocent people have been slaughtered. In Egypt, the Muslim
Brotherhood has come to power, and the country's peace treaty with Israel hangs In the balance. In Libya, our ambassador was murdered In a terrorist attack. U.S.
embassies throughout the region have been stormed in violent protests. And in Iran, the ayatollahs continue to move full tilt toward nuclear-weapons capability, all
the while promising to annihilate Israel.
These developments are not, as President Obama says, mere ""bumps in the road."" They are major issues that put our security at risk.
Yet amid this upheaval, our country seems to be at the mercy of events rather than shaping them. We're not moving them in a direction that protects our people or
our allies.
And that's dangerous. If the Middle East descends into chaos, if Iran moves toward nuclear breakout, or if Israel's security is compromised, America could be
pulled into the maelstrom.
We still have time to address these threats, but it will require a new strategy toward the Middle East
The first step is to understand how we got here. Since World War II, America has been the leader of the Free World. We're unique in having earned that role not
through conquest but through promoting human rights, free markets and the rule of law. We ally ourselves with like-minded countries, expand prosperity through
trade and keep the peace by maintaining a military second to none.
But in recent years, President Obama has allowed our leadership to atrophy. Our economy is stuck in a ""recovery"" that barely deserves the name. Our national
debt has risen to record levels. Our military, tested by a decade of war, is facing devastating cuts thanks to the budgetary games played by the White House.
Finally, our values have been misapplied—and misunderstood—by a president who thinks that weakness will win favor with our adversaries.
By failing to maintain the elements of our influence and by stepping away from our allies, President Obama has heightened the prospect of conflict and instability.
He does not understand that an American policy that lacks resolve can provoke aggression and encourage disorder.
The Middle East is a case in point. The Arab Spring presented an opportunity to help move millions of people from oppression to freedom. But it also presented
grave risks. We needed a strategy for success, but the president offered none. And now he seeks to downplay the significance of the calamities of the past few
weeks
The same incomprehension afflicts the president's policy toward Israel. The president began his term with the explicit policy of creating ""daylight"" between our two
countries. He recently downgraded Israel from being our ""closest ally"" in the Middle East to being only ""one of our closest allies."" It's a diplomatic message that will
be received clearly by Israel and its adversaries alike. He dismissed Israel's concerns about Iran as mere ""noise"" that he prefers to ""block out."" And at a time when
Israel needs America to stand with it, he declined to meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
In this period of uncertainty, we need to apply a coherent strategy of supporting our partners in the Middle East—that is, both governments and individuals who
share our values.
This means restoring our credibility with Iran. When we say an Iranian nuclear-weapons capability—and the regional instability that comes with it--is unacceptable,
the ayatollahs must be made to believe us.
It means placing no daylight between the United States and Israel, And it means using the full spectrum of our soft power to encourage liberty and opportunity for
those who have for too long known only corruption and oppression. The dignity of work and the ability to steer the course of their lives are the best alternatives to
extremism.
But this Middle East policy will be undermined unless we restore the three sinews of our influence: our economic strength, our military strength and the strength Of
our values. That will require a very different set of policies from those President Obama is pursuing.

The 20th century became an American Century because we were steadfast in defense of freedom. We made the painful sacrifices necessary to defeat
totalitarianism In all of Its guises.. To defend ourselves and our allies, we paid the price in treasure and in soldiers who never came home.
Our challenges are different now, but if the 21st century is to be another American Century, we need leaders who understand that keeping the peace requires
American strength in all of its dimensions.

Bic sending more arms into a society generally — particularly when they are as disorganized and fragmented as they are
— will result in more violence — against each other. Boys like to play with guns (trust me as the mother of sons). I am all
for saying we have no objection to French doing it to increase pressure on Gaddafi, but in a tribal society where conflicts
have been repressed for so long, adding even more weapons does not make sense. Obviously they can get weapons
from other places, but nb that they are not awash in weapons now. I wrote something for New York Review of Books

Person of Interest: United States UN Ambassador Susan Rice
Oct 8, 2012 iloo AM EDT
Leslie H. Gelb
A diplomat under fire.
With the presidential campaign drowning in boredom, commentators were desperately
searching for news, preferably a new victim, to brighten their days. And along came Susan
Rice. A couple Sundays ago, the U.N. ambassador made the mistake of appearing on the talk
shows to insist that the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, was ""spontaneous""
rather than a terrorist plot. You would have thought she had said that the pope was a
Mormon.
Out came the Washington daggers. She lied. She was a shill. Benghazi was no spontaneous
event. It was the work of an al Qaeda offshoot. The White House had fumbled key
intelligence information and was now trying to cover up its unforgivable mistake. Rice was
just covering up for the president. Her reward would be Obama's nominating her to succeed
Hillary Clinton as secretary of State.
The commentariat immediately rolled out plans to nail Rice and the Obama team to the
wall. Peter King, the Grand Inquisitor of the Republicans in the House of Representatives,
pledged to ""investigate"" and hold hearings. And that, said the commentariat, would be the
end of Rice's hopes to become the new Hillary.

Now, let's take an unfashionable step back and examine the facts, such as they are. Rice did
not make up the ""spontaneous"" story or have it handed to her by White House conspirators.
She got it from the same daily intelligence brief given to the president. Those daily intel
reports told the very story Rice repeated publicly, i.e., that the Benghazi mob formed more
or less on its own, mainly in reaction to the American video cartooning sacred Muslim
figures, and that extremists then took advantage to kill, including Ambassador Christopher
Stevens. Rice didn't make up that story. The problem was not with Rice; it was with the
inevitably complicated U.S. intelligence process.
Her mistake was taking the initial intelligence at face value. The White House biiefers made
the same error, and so did I. I too repeated in an op-ed on The Daily Beast what the
intelligence briefers told me, but I knew very well that more and contradictory information
would appear soon enough. It always does.
Sure, the CIA had additional intel from the start, but it hadn't begun to sift through all the
communications intercepts, satellite photos, and human reports. It always takes time to sort
out facts from fictions and find consistent threads. Seemingly, this gossamer information is
now taking shape.
Meantime, Rice is still very much in the running for the job at Fogg' Bottom, along with
Senator John Kerry, NSC Adviser Tom Donilon, and former diplomat Nicholas Burns, now
of Harvard. She was Obama's earliest loyalist in the foreign-policy crowd, and he still likes
her, despite lackluster reports on her performance at the U.N. The smears, though flatly
inaccurate, won't help her either. What will help her and, more importantly a flagging
Obama after the first debate, is hunting down the Benghazi culprits.

Libya's Rebels
Pm Just Speaking For Myself, Former President Says
By SUZAN CLARICE
April 3, 2011 —
Former U.S. President Bill Clinton said he thinks the United States should consider arming the rebels in Libya's
civil war.
""It would depend ... and I might need to know a little more, but I would be inclined to do it,"" Clinton told
correspondent Bianna Golodryga today in San Diego during an exclusive interview with ABC News.
Clinton was in San Diego for his annual Clinton Global Initiative University Meeting.
The uprising in Libya stared in February during a wave of social and political unrest in the Middle East.
Fighting has escalated all across the country, but the rebels have found themselves outgunned by Libyan leader
Col. Moamrnar Gadhafi's forces, which are better equipped.
Last month the United Nations authorized a no-fly zone over the North African nation to prevent further attacks
on civilians from Gadhafiss troops in the air.
Clinton on Arming Rebels: 'I Sure Wouldn't Shut the Door to It'
The United States backed the no-fly zone and has also authorized additional support for the anti-Gad hafi
fighters, but key U.S. lawmakers and top officials in the government of President Barack Obanaa have said they
are not comfortable with arming the rebels -- apparently because not enough is known about then
But Clinton said he wouldn't completely rule out the idea of supplying arms to Libya's rebels.

""Let me just say this. I sure wouldn't shut the door to it. I think ... we may need to know a little more,"" he said.
Clinton, husband of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, stressed that he was speaking without ""any official
sanction"" whatsoever.
""I'm just speaking from myself. But I certainly wouldn't take that off the table, too,"" he said.

Ivo, thanks for the helpful response. From NEA's perspective, an operational liaison with the TNC does
not constitute formal, legal recognition of the INC as the government of Libya. We don't consider
Chris Stevens' presence in Benghazi to trigger formal recognition, and we've never broken relations
with Libya despite suspending our embassy operations.
Without question, having a NATO liaison in Benghazi would have the appearance of NATO leaning in
the direction of the INC. But NATO's operations already show a considerable lean away from
Qadhati. Speaking for NEA, I don't mind the appearance. But the real purpose would be to avoid
friendly fire incidents, of course.
Cheers,

All:
Ops has provided below the latest Stevens update on Benghazi:
• Traffkaccidenti Police have accepted the USG version of the story: that it was an accident and the
victims were not wearing seathelts. The USG employees were returning from the airport when the
incident occurred. A total of four people died and six injured. USG employee Mjuries are light if any.
Our people are standing by pending official USG instructions. Stevens notes there is a UK flight
tomorrow they could be on if necessary. The TNC wants to do a press release to quell the rumor mill.
Stevens will send the draft back to Department for L and PA clearance.
• The British envoy departs tomorrow on permanent change of station. There will be a gap before his
replacement, John Jenkins, arrives from Baghdad.
• INC head Malunoud fibril will be going to Jordan and will not be back in Benghazi until Friday. The
development is likely to he met with additional criticism that he is spending too much time abroad at the
expense of other government affairs.

126,"Rice on ""This Week""Here is Susan on this week. She wasn't asked about whether we had any intel. But she did make clear our
view that this started spontaneously and then evolved. The only troubling sentence relates to the
investigation, specifically: And we'll see when the investigation unfolds whether what was -- what
transpired in Benghazi might have unfolded differently in different circumstances."" But she got pushed
there.
Waiting on other transcripts.
For more on what happened and why, let's bring in the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Dr. Susan
Rice. Dr. Rice, thank you for joining us.
RICE: Good to be with you, Jake.
TAPPER: So, first of all, what is the latest you can tell us on who these attackers were at the embassy or at
the consulate in Benghazi? We're hearing that the Libyans have arrested people. They're saying that some
people involved were from outside the country, that there might have even been Al Qaida ties. What's the
latest information?
RICE: Well, Jake, first of all, it's important to know that there's an FBI investigation that has begun and
will take some time to be completed. That will tell us with certainty what transpired.
But our current best assessment, based on the information that we have at present, is that, in fact, what
this began as, it was a spontaneous -- not a premeditated -- response to what had transpired in Cairo. In
Cairo, as you know, a few hours earlier, there was a violent protest that was undertaken in reaction to this
very offensive video that was disseminated.
We believe that folks in Benghazi, a small number of people came to the embassy to -- or to the consulate,
rather, to replicate the sort of challenge that was posed in Cairo. And then as that unfolded, it seems to
have been hijacked, let us say, by some individual clusters of extremists who came with heavier weapons,
weapons that as you know in -- in the wake of the revolution in Libya are -- are quite common and
accessible. And it then evolved from there.

We'll wait to see exactly what the investigation finally confirms, but that's the best information we have at
present.
TAPPER: Why was there such a security breakdown? Why was there not better security at the compound
in Benghazi? Why were there not U.S. Marines at the embassy in Tripoli?
RICE: Well, first of all, we had a substantial security presence with our personnel...
TAPPER: Not substantial enough, though, right?
RICE: ... with our personnel and the consulate in Benghazi. Tragically, two of the four Americans who
were killed were there providing security. That was their function. And indeed, there were many other
colleagues who were doing the same with them.
It obviously didn't prove sufficient to the -- the nature of the attack and sufficient in that -- in that
moment. And that's why, obviously, we have reinforced our remaining presence in Tripoli and why the
president has very -- been very clear that in Libya and throughout the region we are going to call on the
governments, first of all, to assume their responsibilities to protect our facilities and our personnel, and
we're reinforcing our facilities and our -- our embassies where possible...
TAPPER: But why...
RICE: ... and where needed.
TAPPER: Why would we not have Marines at the embassy in Tripoli to begin with? It would seem like this
-- this is obviously an unstable country. This is a region where U.S. interests have been attacked in
previous months. Why were there not Marines there to begin with?
RICE: First of all, there are Marines in some places around the world. There are not Marines in every
facility. That depends on the circumstances. That depends on the requirements. Our presence in Tripoli,
as in Benghazi, is relatively new, as you will recall. We've been back post-revolution only for a matter of
months.
But I've visited there myself, both to Tripoli and Benghazi. I was very grateful to have a strong security
presence with me as part of our -- our embassy detachment there. So we certainly are aware that Libya is a
place where there have been increasingly some violent incidents. The security personnel that the State
Department thought were required were in place. And we'll see when the investigation unfolds whether
what was -- what transpired in Benghazi might have unfolded differently in different circumstances.
But the president has been very clear. The protection of American personnel and facilities is and will
remain our top priority. That's why we've reinforced our presence in Tripoli and elsewhere.

TAPPER: Look at this map, if you would. There have been protests around the world over the last several
days. And President Obama pledged to repair America's relationships with the Muslim world. Why does
the U.S. seem so impotent? And why is the U.S. even less popular today in some of these Muslim and Arab
countries than it was four years ago?
RICE: Jake, we're not impotent. We're not even less popular, to challenge that assessment. I don't know
on what basis you make that judgment. But let me -- let me point...
TAPPER: It just seems that the U.S. government is powerless as this -- as this maelstrom erupts.
RICE: It's actually the opposite. First of all, let's be clear about what transpired here. What happened this
week in Cairo, in Benghazi, in many other parts of the region...
TAPPER: Tunisia, Khartoum...
RICE: ... was a result a direct result of a heinous and offensive video that was widely disseminated, that
the U.S. government had nothing to do with, which we have made clear is reprehensible and disgusting.
We have also been very clear in saying that there is no excuse for violence, there is -- that we have
condemned it in the strongest possible terms.
But let's look at what's happened. It's quite the opposite of being impotent. We have worked with the
governments in Egypt. President Obama picked up the phone and talked to President Morsi in Egypt. And
as soon as he did that, the security provided to our personnel in our embassies dramatically increased.
President Morsi...
TAPPER: It took two days for President Morsi to say anything about this.
RICE: President Morsi has been out repeatedly and said that he condemns this violence. He's called off --
and his people have called off any further demonstrations and have made very clear that this has to stop.
(CROSSTALK)
RICE: Now, and and same, frankly, in Tunisia, in Yemen, and, of course, in Libya, where the
government has -- has gone out of its way to try to step up security and express deepest remorse for what
has happened. We are quite popular in Libya, as you might expect, having been a major partner in their
revolution. What transpired outside of our consulate in Benghazi was not an expression of deep-seated
anti-Americanism on the part of the Libyan people. Quite the contrary. The counter-demonstrations, the
outpouring of sympathy and support for Ambassador Stevens and for the United States, the government
of Libya and -- and the people on the street saying how pained they are by this, is much more a reflection
of the sentiment towards the United States than a small handful of heavily armed mobsters.

TAPPER: That certainly, according to polling, is the case in Libya. Not the case in Egypt. And since you
brought up President Morsi, let me try to get some clarification on something. President Obama was asked
about the relationship with Egypt on Wednesday, and this is what he said.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
OBAMA: I don't think that we would consider them an ally, but we don't consider them an enemy. They
are a new government that is trying to find its way.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
TAPPER: The United States has sent billions of dollars of U.S. taxpayer money to Egypt over the last few
decades. And by definition, as you know, according to the State Department, Egypt is a major non-NATO
ally of the United States. Why would President Obama say Egypt is not an ally?
RICE: Well, first of all, the president has been very clear and -- and everybody understands that Egypt is a
very critical partner of the United States, has long been so. That relationship remains the same, and the
president wasn't signaling any change in -- in the nature...
TAPPER: Was he trying to nudge Morsi?
RICE: The president wasn't signaling any change in the nature of our relationship. Obviously, the
president had a conversation with President Morsi and a very productive one, in which he underscored
that it's, of course, the responsibility of the Egyptian government as host to protect diplomatic personnel
and facilities, including our own, and we saw that President Morsi, immediately after that, took dramatic
steps to improve the security of our facilities in Cairo and elsewhere, and then went out and repeatedly
made a number of very important and powerful statements condemning the violence and conveying the
message that, however hateful such a video may be, there is absolutely no justification for violence against
the United States or other Western partners.
So what we've seen is that the president has been incredibly calm, incredibly steady, and incredibly
measured in his approach to this set of developments. And his interventions, his leadership has ensured
that in Egypt, in Yemen, in Tunisia, in Libya, and many other parts of the world, that leaders have come
out and made very plain that there's no excuse for this violence. We heard Prime Minister Erdogan of
Turkey say the same, we heard the Grand Mufti in Saudi Arabia say the same, that there's no excuse for
violence, that violence is to be condemned, and that governments have a responsibility to protect United
States personnel and facilities and those of all foreign diplomats.
TAPPER: I know you have to go, but very quickly, was the president in that interview trying to nudge
President Morsi, ""Get your act together""?

that -- that was conveyed very directly, and the results were immediate and quite satisfactory.

146,"Jeff updateContrast between Benghazi and reports from the West: Here in Benghazi since Thursday, I have joined our
representative, Chris Stevens, in meetings with a large number of representatives from the TNC, civil society, UN
organizations and NG0s, and the diplomatic corps. While we had no idea that our trip would correspond with significant
military advances in the east and the start of the coordinated Tripoli uprising dubbed ""Operation Mermaid Dawn,"" the
timing gave us the opportunity to note the contrast between the relative bureaucratic quiet here compared to hyped-up
activity in western Libya. Clearly, some coordination is underway between Benghazi and the west: Ali Tarhouni, recently
promoted to Deputy Prime Minister In a still-to-be-completed cabinet reshufle, previewed the Tripoli uprising with us,
down almost to the minute. Yet one feels that, to a large extent, TNC officials are observers and chroniclers rather than
the authors of the unfolding developments to the west. (In a telling anecdote, just after confiding in us the plans for
Tripoli about to unfold, Tarhouni turned off his ringing cell phone, to concentrate on talking to us in a leisurely
manner.) What TNC officials told us to a large extent was sensible and mostly reassuring in its content -- and the TNC
just issued a directive reiterating its policy to treat combatants according to the Geneva conventions and observe human
rights -- but their comments fell mostly in the category of passive analysis rather than aggressive forward
thinking. Washington has task forces in focused on Tripoli; Benghazi does not
While there's a sense in the air that the final battles have begun, that palpable anticipation does not seem to have
translated into the type of stepped-up bureaucratic activity that one would expect. After meeting with us for nearly two
hours on Thursday, TNC Executive Committee chair (and PM equivalent) Mahmoud Jibril returned to Doha rather than
head any kind of war room here. I was on the ground far longer than Jibril, giving another cameo appearance
here. Tarhouni confided that there is no plan for when or how the TNC would relocate quickly to Tripoli, should Tripoli
fall. TNC Chairman Mustafa Abduljalil (who remains by all accounts a unifying figure here) is a humble, retiring leader,
which after Qadhafi's flamboyance is part of the attraction for Libyans but which does not make him naturally think of
how to project INC authority and symbolism quickly to the newly liberated areas. The question is when Tripoli falls, do
the extensive plans that the TNC has made about the post Qadhafi transitional structures have any relevance for
Tripoli? I do not want to overplay this: the flags being raised in the western towns are the flags used here. Our visit to
the military command center demonstrated that there is active information flow (if not exactly command and control)
passing between east and west. Tarhouni and others who visit western towns, usually from Tunis, describe support
there and from tribal leaders across Libya. No other groups are claiming to have established or planned for an
alternative civilian authority to compete with the TNC. Still, in our engagement with TNC officials, we will need to
remind them continually of the imperative to nurture their legitimacy and authority and to prevent a political vacuum
that others could fill -- especially after Tripoli falls and the INC is here, not there.
We've talked a lot about Tripoli and whether a battle for the capital could be avoided, which we argued would be the
best solution. One of the TNC's assets is the moral distinction between what the Libya that the TNC aspires to promote
and how Qadhafi has treated Libya's citizens. The world's attention will focus on a battle for Tripoli, we cautioned, and
acts of brutality and revenge and potential internal fights among competing militias will blur that moral distinction even
more than the assassination of INC Chief of Staff Abdulfatah Younis already did. The damage to the TNC's credibility
could be irreparable. We also noted that a TNC led negotiation that succeeds in winning Tripoli without a fight would
underscore the TNC leadership far more dramatically than a successful militia assault only vaguely connected to the
Benghazi leadership. The TNC officials heard us out patiently, but they clearly were not in the mood to negotiate. They
feel confident about the current military situation, and they remain convinced that Qadhafi simply will not give up no
matter how high the pressure. If anything, their positions have hardened in recent weeks, with Abduljalil telling us that
the TNC will no longer contemplate Qadhafi staying in Libya once he is out of power. Saif Qadhafi is seen in the same
category as his father. I do not believe that anything short of a significant change -- Qadhafi's departure, a military

setback that punctures the TNC's current confidence, NATO insisting on a pause in operations in favor of negotiations --
will persuade the TNC leadership that it is in their interest right now to offer Qadhafi a peaceful way out. Tarhouni also
acknowledged with his trademark candor that, to the Libyan people right now, negotiations would appear weak and
not a satisfactory climax to the revolution. They do have a point that, despite signs of desperation around Qadhafi (e.g.,
Mohammed Ismail's multiple attempts to contact Gene Cretz and me), there is no indication that Qadhafi himself is
prepared to throw in the towel. There is real fear that, should Qadhafi somehow make it from Tripoli to Sebha, a guerilla
war could persist for years, with supplies and mercernaries smuggled across the Saharan border.
Among other topics, we pushed the INC officials hard on starting a high-profile discussion immediately on the
reconciliation which is part of the TNC's platform. We noted that the many victims of Qadhafi's 42-year rule will be less
likely to pursue individual acts of revenge If they are assured that there will be some form to address grievances through
rule-of-law accountability. The same message should also appeal to average Libyans who for whatever reason remained
as part of Qadhafi's regime to the end but who have no blood on their hands and might otherwise fear retribution. INC
officials refer approvingly to the South African and Moroccan models, and they reiterated their commitment for an
inclusive process for Libya's future that welcomes all but the most notorious individuals around Qadhafi. Yet they still
seem to rely largely on (variously described) luck, tribal discipline, and the ""gentle character"" of the Libyan people as the
best assurances against abuse and revenge killings. We will continue to push on this.
Benghazi remained full of chatter about the Abdulfatah Younis assassination. With tribal visits and investigation
committees and cabinet changes, the INC addressed the immediate crisis sufficiently effectively that the intiial tension
and gunfire quickly dissipated. But the assassination highlighted two realities of Libyan life that TNC officials had
previously tried to downplay: tribes and militias. Rather than denying the tribal affiliations of Libyans, TNC officials are
now looking to the tribes as part of the solution in enforcing discipline and preventing the type of widescale looting and
pillaging that destroyed Benghazi's security infrastructure in March. Tribes, we heard, can also be a corrective balance
to Islamist leanings. On reining in the militias, we heard no good answers. Some people (Tarhouni, INC National
Security Advisor Bazama, some civil society representatives) spoke frankly about the problem, including the Islamist
leanings of the most powerful. The Islamist militias deserve more discussion in other channels, but a couple of people
noted that the Younis assassination had an upside in making scrutiny of this issue imperative. Others seemed to rely,
again, on luck or tried to avert their eyes from the problem that militias could post on the Day After. There was
widespread disdain for Qatar's role in encouraging certain militia elements, and I will be able to cite lots of concern here
when I go to Doha later. Qatar's role, too, is a subject better discussed elsewhere.
We also discussed humanitarian and financial needs. Tarhouni and Jibril noted that the TNC's financial needs increase as
more territory falls under rebel control; they are worried that, if they can't provide electricity to newly liberated towns
or fund other services there, disenchantment with the TNC will grow. Tarhouni agreed to reach out to the Indians to
discuss Libya's outstanding debts, to see if he can help us get India's hold on the frozen asset proposal lifted. Briefed on
South Africa's objections, fibril understood the need for continued outreach to Africa (although part of our South Africa
problem may derive from Jibril's poor relations with Zuma, with Jibril telling us that he recently accused Zuma of making
Nelson Mandela feel ashamed); Abdulrahman Shalgam will go to the August 25-26 AU Summit and Jibril did not rule out
attending himself. I've spoken several times to UAE Foreign Minister Abdullah bin Zayed since arriving here, and the
UAE has finally responded positively to our soft collateral proposal for a loan to the TNC, which may be our fastest way
of getting funds here, assuming we can come up with a letter that meets the UAE's needs and passes the scrutiny of the
U.S. interagency process.
My traveling companions, Bill Roebuck (NEA/MAG director) and Ben Fishman from the NSS, start their return trip today.
I will go on to Cairo, Doha, and Abu Dhabi, where, inter alia, I will have more Libya discussions, including seeing Jibril
again in Doha. With NileSat continuing to broadcast Qadhafi's propaganda, the Libyan anger over Egypt's role
approaches if not exceeds annoyance with Qataar. We are also checking on how to get from Cairo back here, should I
need to join Chris here in the coming days.
Chris and his tiny staff are doing a heroic job in representing our interests here. I am especially appreciative to DS for all
the work done to support my trip. I also want to highlight the work that Pat Kennedy's M family and NEA/EX did in
establiishing living and working quarters for Chris and his team. Thanks to a lot of creativity and hard work, the

151,"Les Gelb on the Obama responseThe whole thing is worth a read, but a very tough judge gives you and the President credit:
By any standard of reason, President Obama and Secretary of State Canton conducted themselves very well amid the
confusion and crises Of course they didn't do everything perfectly; for example, some unidentified administration official
disowned the embassy statement condemning the video. Such creepiness served only to make it look like Obama was
running for cover at the expense of our embattled diplomats. But minor miscues aside, Obama and Clinton nailed the
main points, especially Clinton. In her first statement soon after the riots, here s what she said The United States
deplores any intentional effort to denigrate the religious beliefs of others. Our commitment to religious tolerance goes back
to the very beginning of our nation. But let me be clear There is never any justification for violent acts of this kind.""

152,"NATOI'm heading back from meetings on women, peace and security at NATO. The chief implementer of WPS at DOD also
traveled with me. It was extremely productive. SG Rasmussen chaired a meeting on 1325 today of all the NATO member
and partner ambassadors incl DaIcier. The new NATO special rep for 1325 -- the position sponsored by Norway and
approved at the Chicago summit — gave her inaugural address, and my DOD colleague and I discussed the US efforts
both generally and in Afghanistan. We were followed by extensive remarks from the NATO ambassadors, all of whom
touched on the importance of women's role in security and NATO's mission, as well as applauded US leadership. Many
mentioned you in their interventions! The ambs from Serbia, Azerbaijan and Georgia pointed to their own national
action plans (their existence was a surprise to us), as well as the new structures they have put in place to implement
them. The ambassador from Azerbaijan even said that he is hopeful women will contribute to ending their regional
conflict (I will tell Morningstar). The new special rep - a seasoned diplomat who knows her way around NATO --- wanted
me to ten you how much you have inspired her -- something I hear everywhere!
I'm confident our NATO visit also served to reinforce the importance of the NAP and the US role with our own people
both at NATO and DOD.
I was sorry to miss the discussion with ASSK but there are more events with her tomw. We are working hard on getting
the engagement of Burmese women into the formal peace structures being put in place to end the ethnic conflicts.
I also met with Vivian Redding at the EU who, despite her efforts, is unlikely to get a quota for women on public boards
of directors adopted. She too expressed her admiration of you and your leadership.
In addition to everything that's been said about Chris Stevens, he really understood the important role the women in
Libya were playing in peace and security. Whenever I met with Libyan women at meetings in the region, they went out
of their way to tell me how much he supported them and how much affection they had for him. Such an awful loss.
You've been magnificent throughout all this, despite how wrenching it's been.

Published September 21, 2012
BENGHAZI, lli3YA — Hundreds of protesters angry over last week's killing of the U.S. ambassador to Libya stormed the
compound of the Islamic extremist militia suspected in the attack, evicting militiamen and setting fire to their building
Friday.
In an unprecedented show of public anger at Libya's rampant militias, the crowd overwhelmed the compound of the
Ansar Al-Sharlah Brigade in the center of the eastern city of Benghazi.
Ansar Al-Shariah fighters initially fired in the air to disperse the crowd, but eventually abandoned the site with their
weapons and vehicles after it was overrun by waves of protesters shouting ""No to militias.""
""I don't want to see armed men wearing Afghani-style clothes stopping me in the street to give me orders, I only want to
see people in uniform,"" said Omar Mohammed, a university student who took part in the takeover of the site, which
protesters said was done in support of the army and police.
No deaths were reported in the incident, which came after tens of thousands marched in Benghazi against armed
militias. One vehicle was also burned at the compound.
For many Libyans, the Sept. 11 attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi was the last straw in one of the biggest
problems Libya has faced since the ouster and death of longtime dictator Moamrnar Qaddafi around a year ago -- the
multiple mini-armies that with their arsenals of machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades are stronger than the
regular armed forces and police.
The militias, a legacy of the rag-tag popular forces that fought Qaddafi's regime, tout themselves as protectors of Libya's
revolution, providing security where police cannot. But many say they act like gangs, detaining and intimidating rivals
and carrying out killings.
Militias made up of Islamic radicals like Ansar Al-Shariah are notorious for attacks on Muslims who don't abide by their
hardline ideology. Officials and witnesses say fighters from Ansar Al-Shariati led the attack on the U.S. consulate, which
killed Amb. Chris Stevens and three other Americans.
After taking over the Ansar compound, protesters then drove to attack the Benghazi headquarters of another Islamist
militia, Rafallah Sahati. The militiamen opened fire on the protesters, who were largely unarmed. At least 20 were
wounded, and there were unconfirmed witness reports of three protesters killed.
Earlier in the day, some 30,000 people filled a broad boulevard as they marched along a lake in central Benghazi on
Friday to the gates of the headquarters of Ansar Al-Shariah.
""No, no, to militias,"" the crowd chanted, filling a broad boulevard. They carried banners and signs demanding that
militias disband and that the government build up police to take their place in keeping security. ""Benghazi is in a trap,""
signs read. ""Where is the army, where is the police?""

Other signs mourned the killing of Stevens, reading, ""The ambassador was Libya's friend"" and ""Libya lost a friend.""
Military helicopters and fighter jets flew overhead, and police mingled in the crowd, buoyed by the support of the
protesters.
The march was the biggest seen in Benghazi, Libya's second largest city and home to 1 million people, since the fall of
Qaddafi in August 2011. The public backlash comes in part in frustration with the interim government, which has been
unable to rein in the armed factions. Many say that officials' attempts to co-opt fighters by paying them have only fueled
the growth of militias without bringing them under state control or integrating them into the regular forces.
Residents of another main eastern city, Darna, have also begun to stand up against Ansar Al-Shariah and other militias.
The anti-militia fervor in Darna is notable because the city, in the mountains along the Mediterranean coast north of
Benghazi, has long had a reputation as a stronghold for Islamic extremists. During the Qaddafi era, it was the hotbed of a
deadly Islamist insurgency against his regime.
A significant number of the Libyan jihadists who travelled to Afghanistan and Iraq during recent wars came from Darna.
During the revolt against him last year, Qaddafi's regime warned that Darna would declare itself an Islamic Emirate and
ally itself with Al Qaeda.
But now, the residents are lashing out against Ansar Al-Shariah, the main Islamic extremist group in the city.
""The killing of the ambassador blew up the situation. It was disastrous,"" said Ayoub al-Shedwi, a young bearded Muslim
preacher in Darna who says he has received multiple death threats because has spoken out against militias on a radio
show he hosts. ""We felt that the revolution is going in vain.""
Leaders of tribes, which are the strongest social force in eastern Libya, have come forward to demand that the militias
disband.
Tribal leaders in Benghazi and Darna announced this week that members of their tribes who are militiamen will no
longer have their protection in the face of anti-militia protests. That means the tribe will not avenge them if they are
killed.
Activists and residents have held a sit-in for the past eight days outside Darna's Sahaba Mosque, calling on tribes to put
an end to the ""state of terrorism"" created by the militias.
Militiamen have been blamed for a range of violence in Darna. On the same day Stevens killed in Benghazi, a number of
elderly Catholic nuns and a priest who have lived in Darna for decades providing free medical services, were attacked,
reportedly beaten or stabbed. There have been 32 killings over the past few months, including the city security chief and
assassinations of former officers from Qaddafi's military.
Darna's residents are conservative, but they largely don't fit the city's reputation as extremists.
Women wear headscarves, but not the more conservative black garb and veil that covers the entire body and face. In
the ancient city's narrow alleys, shops display sleeveless women dresses and the young men racing by in cars blare
Western songs.
And many are impatient with Ansar Al-Sharjah's talk of imposing its strict version of Islamic law. The group's name
means ""Supporters of Shariah Law.""
""We are not infidels for God sake, We have no bars, no discos, we are not practicing vice in the street,"" said Wassam ben
Madin, a leading activist in the city who lost his right eye in clashes with security forces on the first day of the uprising
against Qaddafi. ""This is not the time for talk about Sharjah. Have a state first then talk to me about Sharjah.""

""If they are the 'supporters of Sharjah' then who are we?"" he said. ""We don't want the flag of Al Qaeda raised over
heads,"" he added, referring to Ansar Al-Shariah's black banner.
One elder resident at the Sahaba Mosque sit-in, Ramadan Yousset said, ""We will talk to them peacefully. We will tell
them you are from us and you fought for us"" during the civil war against Qaddafi. But 'if you say no (to integrating into
the) police and army, we will storm your place. It's over.""
Officials in the interim government and security forces say they are not strong enough to crack down on the militias. The
armed factions have refused government calls for them to join the regular army and police.
So the government has created a ""High Security Committee"" aimed at grouping the armed factions as a first step to
integration, Authorities pay fighters a salary of as much as 1,000 dinars, around $900, to join -- compared to the average
police monthly salary of around $200.
However, the militias that join still do not abide by government authority, and critics say the lure of salaries has only
prompted more militias to form.
Officials and former rebel commanders estimate the number of rebels that actually fought in the 8-month civil war
against Gadhafi at around 30,000. But those now listed on the High Security Committee payroll have reached several
hundred thousand.
""All these militia and entities are fake ones but it is mushrooming,"" said Khaled Hadar, a Benghazi-based lawyer. 'The
government is only making temporarily solutions, but you are creating a disaster.""

Op-Ed
The world after Petraeus
Obama should seize this chance to adjust his foreign policy.
By Sarah Chayes
November 15, 2012
The scandal enveloping members of America's adulated top brass is the deepest crisis to hit the military in
decades. It is a crisis President Obama did not need — shaming the country and increasing his burden during a
major transition on his national security team. And yet, crisis can be a great corrective. Obama should use this
one to reverse one of the most dysfunctional elements of U.S. foreign policy over the last decade: an infatuation
with military solutions to problems that are fundamentally political.
The resignation of former Central Intelligence Agency Director David H. Petraeus after an extramarital affair
came to light, together with expected high-level personnel changes at the State Department and other agencies,
creates a singular opportunity to embark on the complex process of rebalancing U.S. foreign policy in favor of
non-military approaches.
When he first came to office, Obama seemed suspicious of Petraeus, who made his reputation under President
George W. Bush as the general who transformed the military's approach to the Iraq war. The suspicion was
reflected in the fraught National Security Council debate over Afghanistan strategy in 2009. Yet since then,
Obama, like so many others, seems to have been seduced by Petraeus. Not by the man but by what the man
could offer him.
Petraeuss unique political genius over the last decade has been to provide each of two contrasting presidents a
military solution to his key national security problems that was tailored to his character. For Bush, obsessed
with Iraq and with leaving a mark on the Middle East, Petraeus helped design a grandiose, troop-heavy
approach.
With the change of administrations, Petraeus soon saw that Obama and his team were different — concerned
about the costs of the inherited wars and about the risks of a runaway military. So while Petraeus continued to
pay lip-service to counterinsurgency doctrine, he veered away from it in practice. His focus as commander of

the troops in Afghanistan — and even more so at the CIA — was on a type of warfare better suited to this
president: targeted, technologically advanced, secretive killing over which the president could exert control.
But such an approach, though cheaper in resources and American lives, is still flawed. It is still a military
answer to problems that are deeply political in nature and rooted in a complex mix of history, regional and
cultural particularism, and the effects of a protracted abuse of power by elites. By shifting to drones and special
ops as the instruments of choice to combat militant extremism, the U.S. government remains consumed by the
same old questions: How many men and women in uniform, equipped with what kind of hardware, need to
employ which tactics to defeat the enemy?
What atrophied during the years that two U.S. administrations dwelt obsessively on these questions were all the
other tools of U.S. foreign policy, including information-gathering and analysis, diplomacy and economic and
legal leverage.
Perhaps the gravest consequence has been the knowledge deficit. Both wars were hampered by a devastating
lack of situational understanding. In Afghanistan, where I lived and worked for more than eight years, I was
stunned by how long it took U.S. officials to realize that tribes were key to Afghan social structure. U.S.
officials resisted meeting with ordinary Afghans, dealing instead with members of a self-serving and unpopular
government. So, for more than a decade, the U.S. government was operating almost blind.
The first way Obama can constructively harness Petraeus downfall is to reorient the CIA toward its core
function: intelligence-gathering. Of late, a body-count culture has prevailed at the CIA, exemplified by the
secretive drone campaign. If 60 intelligence professionals are assigned to planning and monitoring each drone
in the air, as has been reported, that's 60 who are not on the ground in country, interacting with locals, gaining
an intuitive feel for the dynamics. Obama should resist the temptation to put another target-focused operator at
the helm of the CIA.
Another main civilian component of U.S. power is its diplomacy. Obama should also use this moment of
transition to think through what kind of State Department he really needs. The instruments of U.S. foreign
policy are multiple, varied and subtle in their application. To avail itself of them, the government needs smart,
adaptable, dynamic risk-takers, who think strategically and operate with autonomy. Such people must be
attracted to government service and provided responsibilities commensurate with their talents.
But the other national security topic of the moment threatens to push Obama in the wrong direction. The death
of Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens in Benghazi, Libya, has been politicized in deeply counterproductive
ways. Members of Congress should bear that in mind as they continue examining the details of the attack.
Stevens was exactly the type of diplomat the U.S. government needs: someone with long experience in the
region to which he was posted, an ambassador who engaged with people, gained insight into the environment
and helped influence it. That kind of diplomacy is essential, but it carries risks. If it becomes politically
untenable in Washington for an ambassador to die in the line of duty, then talented diplomats will be hobbled.
And faced with a choked career path, the best will look elsewhere for rewarding work. Obama should appoint a
secretary of State determined to counteract the tendency to retrench.
Perhaps the most important foreign policy challenge Obama faces in his second term is how to expand,
restructure and reinforce the range of civilian instruments of U.S. power. That is a generational task, but one the
current crisis has provided an unparalleled opportunity to tackle.

Illhave to defer to Gene on this. It's a fascinating read, and some stuff mentioned has already happened (such as the

ins and outs of the new Libyan politics in sufficient detail to give a view as to the accuracy of this report A few bits
seemed off key (e.g, the reference that both the misrata and Zintan Brigades once reported ""loosely"" to BelHaj I don't
believe is true, since Juwaili and the IJAE supported the latter and Qatar the former).
The comment about Belhaj staying out of govt and thus retain the flexibility to carp and make trouble: Jake, you may
remember that AbZ warned exactly of that danger in that weird mtg Qatar insisted upon on the margins of UNGA.

U.S. Ambassador Susan Rice said Wednesday her early account of the attack that killed the U.S. ambassador to Libya and
three other Americans in Benghazi was based on the initial intelligence community assessments and was always subject
to review and updates.
She said she respected Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who has been critical of her, but said ""some of the statements he's
made about me have been unfounded, but I look forward to having the opportunity at the appropriate time to discuss
all of this with him.""
Her comments attributed the attacks to a mob enraged over an anti-Muslim video posted on YouTube were widely
denounced by Republicans during the U.S. presidential campaign. The attack came an the 11th anniversary of the Sept.
11, 2001, terror attacks on the United States, and her critics said it was clearly a terrorist attack timed to take place on
the anniversary.
The focus has fallen on her because she is a longtime White House insider and is believed to be President Barack
Obama's first choice to replace Secrretary of State Hillary Clinton, who is not expected to stay on during his second term.
Rice told reporters outside the U.N. Security Council: ""As a senior U.S. diplomat, I agreed to a White House request to
appear on the Sunday shows to talk about the full range of national security issues of the day, which at that time were
primarily and particularly the protests that were enveloping and threatening many diplomatic facilities, American
diplomatic facilities around the world, and Iran's nuclear program.""
Hours before the Benghazi violence, a mob in Cairo attacked the U.S. Embassy there to denounce the videos as anti-
Islamic blasphemy. Killed in the Benghazi violence were Ambassador Chris Stevens, foreign service officer Sean Smith
and two former Navy SEALs, Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods.
Rice said, ""The attack on our facilities in Benghazi was obviously a significant piece of this"" pattern.
""When discussing he attack against our facilities in Benghazi, I relied solely and squarely on the information provided to
me by the intelligence community,"" she said.
""I made clear that the information was preliminary, and that our investigations would give us the definitive answers,""
she added.

Statement on the Attack in Benghazi
September 11, 2012
I condemn in the strongest terms the attack on our mission in Benghazi today. As we work to
secure our personnel and facilities, we have confirmed that one of our State Department officers
was killed. We are heartbroken by this terrible loss. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family
and those who have suffered in this attack.
This evening, I called Libyan President Magariaf to coordinate additional support to protect
Americans in Libya. President Magariaf expressed his condemnation and condolences and
pledged his government's full cooperation.
Some have sought to justify this vicious behavior as a response to inflammatory material posted
on the Internet. The United States deplores any intentional effort to denigrate the religious beliefs
of others. Our commitment to religious tolerance goes back to the very beginning of our nation.
But let me be clear: There is never any justification for violent acts of this kind.
In light of the events of today, the United States government is working with partner countries
around the world to protect our personnel, our missions, and American citizens worldwide.
Statement on the Death of American Personnel in Benghazi, Libya
September 12, 2012
It is with profound sadness that I share the news of the death of four American personnel in
Benghazi, Libya yesterday. Among them were United States Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens
and Foreign Service Information Management Officer, Sean Smith. We are still making next of
kin notifications for the other two individuals. Our hearts go out to all their families and
colleagues.
A 21 year veteran of the Foreign Service, Ambassador Stevens died last night from injuries he
sustained in the attack on our office in Benghazi.
I had the privilege of swearing in Chris for his post in Libya only a few months ago. He spoke
eloquently about his passion for service, for diplomacy and for the Libyan people. This
assignment was only the latest in his more than two decades of dedication to advancing closer
ties with the people of the Middle East and North Africa which began as a Peace Corps
Volunteer in Morocco. As the conflict in Libya unfolded, Chris was one of the first Americans
on the ground in Benghazi. He risked his own life to lend the Libyan people a helping hand to
build the foundation for a new, free nation. He spent every day since helping to finish the work
that he started. Chris was committed to advancing America's values and interests, even when
that meant putting himself in danger.
Sean Smith was a husband and a father of two, who joined the Department ten years ago. Like

Chris, Sean was one of our best. Prior to arriving in Benghazi, he served in Baghdad, Pretoria,
Montreal, and most recently The Hague.
All the Americans we lost in yesterday's attacks made the ultimate sacrifice. We condemn this
vicious and violent attack that took their lives, which they had committed to helping the Libyan
people reach for a better future.
America's diplomats and development experts stand on the front lines every day for our country.
We are honored by the service of each and every one of them.
Remarks on the Deaths of American Personnel in Benghazi, Libya
September 12, 2012
Yesterday, our U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya was attacked. Heavily armed militants
assaulted the compound and set fire to our buildings. American and Libyan security personnel
battled the attackers together. Four Americans were killed. They included Sean Smith, a Foreign
Service information management officer, and our Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens. We are
still making next of kin notifications for the other two individuals.
This is an attack that should shock the conscience of people of all faiths around the world. We
condemn in the strongest terms this senseless act of violence, and we send our prayers to the
families, friends, and colleagues of those we've lost.
All over the world, every day, America's diplomats and development experts risk their lives in
the service of our country and our values, because they believe that the United States must be a
force for peace and progress in the world, that these aspirations are worth striving and sacrificing
for. Alongside our men and women in uniform, they represent the best traditions of a bold and
generous nation.
In the lobby of this building, the State Department, the names of those who have fallen in the line
of duty are inscribed in marble. Our hearts break over each one. And now, because of this
tragedy, we have new heroes to honor and more friends to mourn.
Chris Stevens fell in love with the Middle East as a young Peace Corps volunteer teaching
English in Morocco. He joined the Foreign Service, learned languages, won friends for America
in distant places, and made other people's hopes his own.
In the early days of the Libyan revolution, I asked Chris to be our envoy to the rebel opposition.
He arrived on a cargo ship in the port of Benghazi and began building our relationships with
Libya's revolutionaries. He risked his life to stop a tyrant, then gave his life trying to help build a
better Libya. The world needs more Chris Stevenses. I spoke with his sister, Ann, this morning,
and told her that he will be remembered as a hero by many nations.

Sean Smith was an Air Force veteran. He spent 10 years as an information management officer
in the State Department, he was posted at The Hague, and was in Libya on a brief temporary
assignment. He was a husband to his wife Heather, with whom I spoke this morning. He was a
father to two young children, Samantha and Nathan. They will grow up being proud of the
service their father gave to our country, service that took him from Pretoria to Baghdad, and
finally to Benghazi.
The mission that drew Chris and Sean and their colleagues to Libya is both noble and necessary,
and we and the people of Libya honor their memory by carrying it forward. This is not easy.
Today, many Americans are asking — indeed, I asked myself— how could this happen? How
could this happen in a country we helped liberate, in a city we helped save from destruction?
This question reflects just how complicated and, at times, how confounding the world can be.
But we must be clear-eyed, even in our grief. This was an attack by a small and savage group —
not the people or Government of Libya. Everywhere Chris and his team went in Libya, in a
country scarred by war and tyranny, they were hailed as friends and partners. And when the
attack came yesterday, Libyans stood and fought to defend our post. Some were wounded.
Libyans carried Chris' body to the hospital, and they helped rescue and lead other Americans to
safety. And last night, when I spoke with the President of Libya, he strongly condemned the
violence and pledged every effort to protect our people and pursue those responsible.
The friendship between our countries, borne out of shared struggle, will not be another casualty
of this attack. A free and stable Libya is still in America's interest and security, and we will not
turn our back on that, nor will we rest until those responsible for these attacks are found and
brought to justice. We are working closely with the Libyan authorities to move swiftly and
surely. We are also working with partners around the world to safeguard other American
embassies, consulates, and citizens.
There will be more time later to reflect, but today, we have work to do. There is no higher
priority than protecting our men and women wherever they serve. We are working to determine
the precise motivations and methods of those who carried out this assault. Some have sought to
justify this vicious behavior, along with the protest that took place at our Embassy in Cairo
yesterday, as a response to inflammatory material posted on the intemet. America's commitment
to religious tolerance goes back to the very beginning of our nation. But let me be clear — there is
no justification for this, none. Violence like this is no way to honor religion or faith. And as long
as there are those who would take innocent life in the name of God, the world will never know a
true and lasting peace.
It is especially difficult that this happened on September I I th. It's an anniversary that means a
great deal to all Americans. Every year on that day, we are reminded that our work is not yet
finished, that the job of putting an end to violent extremism and building a safe and stable world
continues. But September 11th means even more than that. It is a day on which we remember

Statement on the Deaths of Tyrone S. Woods and Glen A. Doherty in Benghazi, Libya
September 13, 2012
The attack on our diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya on Tuesday claimed the lives of four
Americans. Yesterday, I spoke about two: Ambassador Chris Stevens and Information
Management Officer Sean Smith. Today, we also recognize the two security personnel who died
helping protect their colleagues. Tyrone S. Woods and Glen A. Doherty were both decorated
military veterans who served our country with honor and distinction. Our thoughts, prayers, and
deepest gratitude are with their families and friends. Our embassies could not carry on our
critical work around the world without the service and sacrifice of brave people like Tyrone and
Glen.
Tyrone's friends and colleagues called him ""Rone,"" and they relied on his courage and skill,
honed over two decades as a Navy SEAL. In uniform, he served multiple tours in Iraq and
Afghanistan. Since 2010, he protected American diplomatic personnel in dangerous posts from
Central America to the Middle East. He had the hands of a healer as well as the arm of a warrior,
earning distinction as a registered nurse and certified paramedic. All our hearts go out to
Tyrone's wife Dorothy and his three sons, Tyrone Jr., Hunter, and Kai, who was born just a few
months ago.
We also grieve for Glen Doherty, called Bub, and his family: his father Bernard, his mother
Barbara, his brother Gregory, and his sister Kathleen. Glen was also a former Navy SEAL and an
experienced paramedic. And he put his life on the line many times, protecting Americans in Iraq,
Afghanistan, and other hotspots. In the end, he died the way he lived — with selfless honor and
unstinting valor.
We condemn the attack that took the lives of these heroes in the strongest terms, and we are
taking additional steps to safeguard American embassies, consulates, and citizens around the
world. This violence should shock the conscience of people of all faiths and traditions. We
appreciate the statements of support that have poured in from across the region and beyond.

People of conscience and goodwill everywhere must stand together in these difficult days against
violence, hate, and division.
I am enormously proud of the men and women who risk their lives every day in the service of
our country and our values. They help make the United States the greatest force for peace,
progress, and human dignity that the world has ever known, We honor the memory of our fallen
colleagues by continuing their work and carrying on the best traditions of a bold and generous

Remarks at the Opening Plenary of the U.S.-Morocco Strategic Dialogue
September 13, 2012
SECRETARY CLINTON: Good morning. Well, let me welcome our friends and colleagues
from Morocco here to the Benjamin Franklin Room on the eighth floor of the State Department
for this very important first session of the U.S.-Morocco Strategic Dialogue. Before I begin to
address the significance of this Strategic Dialogue and the next step in our long relations with
Morocco, I want to say a few words about the events unfolding in the world today.
We are closely watching what is happening in Yemen and elsewhere, and we certainly hope and
expect that there will be steps taken to avoid violence and prevent the escalation of protests into
violence.
I also want to take a moment to address the video circulating on the Internet that has led to these
protests in a number of countries. Let me state very clearly — and I hope it is obvious — that the
United States Government had absolutely nothing to do with this video. We absolutely reject its
content and message. America's commitment to religious tolerance goes back to the very
beginning of our nation. And as you know, we are home to people of all religions, many of
whom came to this country seeking the right to exercise their own religion, including, of course,
millions of Muslims. And we have the greatest respect for people of faith.
To us, to me personally, this video is disgusting and reprehensible. It appears to have a deeply
cynical purpose: to denigrate a great religion and to provoke rage. But as I said yesterday, there
is no justification, none at all, for responding to this video with violence, We condemn the
violence that has resulted in the strongest terms, and we greatly appreciate that many Muslims in
the United States and around the world have spoken out on this issue.
Violence, we believe, has no place in religion and is no way to honor religion. Islam, like other
religions, respects the fundamental dignity of human beings, and it is a violation of that
fundamental dignity to wage attacks on innocents. As long as there are those who are willing to
shed blood and take innocent life in the name of religion, the name of God, the world will never
know a true and lasting peace. It is especially wrong for violence to be directed against
diplomatic missions. These are places whose very purpose is peaceful: to promote better
understuiding across countries and cultures. All governments have a responsibility to protect

those spaces and people, because to attack an embassy is to attack the idea that we can work
together to build understanding and a better future.
Now, I know it is hard for some people to understand why the United States cannot or does not
just prevent these kinds of reprehensible videos from ever seeing the light of day. Now, I would
note that in today's world with today's technologies, that is impossible. But even if it were
possible, our country does have a long tradition of free expression which is enshrined in our
Constitution and our law, and we do not stop individual citizens from expressing their views no
matter how distasteful they may be.
There are, of course, different views around the world about the outer limits of free speech and
free expression, but there should be no debate about the simple proposition that violence in
response to speech is not acceptable. We all — whether we are leaders in government, leaders in
civil society or religious leaders — must draw the line at violence. And any responsible leader
should be standing up now and drawing that line.
I wanted to begin with this statement, because, as our Moroccan friends and all of you know, this
has been a difficult week at the State Department. I very much appreciate, Minister, the
condolences your government expressed to our Embassy in Rabat And even though that tragedy
happened far away in Benghazi, we found a reminder of the deep bounds that connect Morocco
to the United States. It was in the High Atlas Mountains of Morocco that one of the Americans
we lost this week, Ambassador Chris Stevens, fell in love with the region when he served as a
Peace Corps volunteer there. That experience set him on a decades-long career of service. So in
the memory of fallen friends and colleagues, let us remind ourselves of the many ways in which
riot just our governments but the people of our two nations have worked together to build a better
future.
In many ways, the United States looks to Morocco to be a leader and a model. His Majesty King
Mohammed deserves great credit for the work you've undertaken. In fact, after my visit to Rabat
earlier this year. I told my team: ""We need to start a Strategic Dialogue with Morocco."" No
country has been a friend of the United States longer than Morocco. You were the first nation to
recognize us back in 1777. But we're not satisfied with simply having a friendship that is
longstanding We want one that is dynamic, growing, looking toward the future. So let me
highlight a few of the areas we should focus on today.
On political reform, we have all seen remarkable changes taking place across North Africa and
the Middle East. I commend Morocco and your government for your efforts to stay ahead of
these changes by holding free and fair elections, empowering the elected parliament, taking other
steps to ensure that the government reflects the will of the people. Today, our political working
group will discuss how the United States can continue to support your efforts to translate
commitments into actions. Because as we all know, democracy, real reform, require that people
themselves feel the changes in their evetyday lives: the courts reformed, the government more

open and transparent, universal human rights of all Moroccans — men and women alike —
respected.
I'm especially pleased by Morocco's commitments to take on the deeply troubling problem of
child marriage. We know that child brides are less likely to get an education, more likely to face
life-threatening problems, particularly around child birth and delivery, which not only
shortchanges them but can even rob them and their communities of their lives and talents. So we
want to encourage the government and civil society to continue their important work together on
this issue.
With regard to the Western Sahara, the United States continues to support efforts to find a
peaceful, sustainable, mutually agreed-upon solution. U.S. policy toward the Western Sahara has
remained consistent for many years. We have made clear that Morocco's autonomy plan is
serious, realistic, and credible, and that it represents a potential approach that could satisfy the
aspirations of the people in the Western Sahara to run their own affairs in peace and dignity. We
continue to support the negotiations carried out by the United Nations and hope parties can work
toward resolution.
With respect to the economy, our second working group will focus on what more can be done to
deliver tangible economic benefits. Morocco's economy is relatively healthy, but you face the
same problem that is now endemic across the world — unemployment is still too high, especially
among young people.
That's why the United States is providing $1.5 million to support an effort to attract foreign
investors, foster local economic development, and combat corruption across the region. And I'm
pleased to announce that later this year we will hold a Morocco business development
conference here in Washington to connect businesses from both countries.
Today, we should discuss ways to build on all of these efforts by increasing bilateral trade, a
particular goal of mine since so much trade from Morocco goes to Europe. I'd like to increase
the amount of trade coming to the United States, and also to improve economic integration
across North Africa, which could greatly benefit Morocco because of Morocco's stability and
Morocco's very strong economic foundation. The greater integration there is, the greater the
benefits for Moroccans.
Third, the attack in Benghazi this week reminds us that security remains a vital issue. Through
our work together on the Global Counterterrorism Task Force, the United States and Morocco
already share crucial information and best practices, and I thank Morocco for hosting a Global
Counterterrorism Task Force workshop on threats in the South Atlantic next month.

We are also collaborating through USAID, the Peace Corps, and other agencies to help provide
Moroccan youth with alternatives to criminal and extremist organizations. And so we are
partnering to help strengthen Morocco's criminal justice system and law enforcement.
There will be a lot to discuss in the meeting today. And let me add, the United States greatly
appreciates the constructive role Morocco is playing on the UN Security Council, especially your
support for the effort to end the violence and bloodshed in Syria and help to usher in a new
democratic future for that country. I commend Morocco for offering to host the next ministerial
meeting of the Friends of the Syrian People, and we look forward to continuing to work closely
together as close partners even after your term on the Security Council has ended.
Finally, our education and cultural ties are reason for much celebration. This year marks the 30th
anniversary of our official program to facilitate academic exchanges and other bonds between us.
There are more than 5,000 Moroccan alumni of these programs. Two are with us today — Dr.
Benjelloun and Dr. Ouaouicha — and we thank them. But among all our work on this front, from
preserving Morocco's historic sites to empowering youth, there's one area I particularly hope we
can focus on today and receive your advice and counsel — namely, interfaith dialogue.
In these tense and turbulent times, it's more important than ever for people of different faiths to
exchange ideas, to build understanding, to promote religious tolerance. It's one of the great
challenges of the 21st century, and it's one that we must address together.
So we have a lot of work to do, Minister, but our friendship runs long and deep, and as the treaty
our nations signed in 1786 says, and I quote, ""Trusting in God, it will remain permanent."" I'm
confident that we will continue to solve problems and produce results that make our nations
stronger, more peaceful, more secure, more prosperous, and also contribute to doing the same for
the world.
So again, let me welcome you, Minister. It's been a great pleasure for me to get to know you, to
work with you, to be your colleague bilaterally, regionally, and globally, and also welcome your
distinguished delegation.
Thank you. (Applause.)

Tonight, our gathering is more somber than any of us would like. This comes during sad and
difficult days for the State Department family. We lost four Americans. They were good and
brave men. They were committed to the cause of building a brighter future for the people of
Libya. And we condemn the violence in the strongest terms, the violence against our posts in
Benghazi, in Egypt, and now in Yemen.
The Libyan ambassador is with us tonight, and I want to take a moment to thank him for the
support that his government and the Libyan people have shown to the United States in this
tragedy, particularly the outpouring of feelings of grief and loss because of the killing of our
ambassador.
Ambassador Aujali, would you mind saying a few words?
AMBASSADOR AMU: [redacted]
SECRETARY CLINTON: Thank you very much, Ambassador. I know that that was a very
personal loss for you, as it was for me. I'm the one who sent Chris to Benghazi during the
revolution to show support and be able to advise our government about what we could do to
bring freedom and democracy and opportunity to the people of Libya.
Religious freedom and religious tolerance are essential to the stability of any nation, any people.
Hatred and violence in the name of religion only poison the well. All people of faith and good
will know that the actions of a small and savage group in Benghazi do not honor religion or God
in any way. Nor do they speak for the more than one billion Muslims around the world, many of
whom have shown an outpouring of support during this time
Unfortunately, however, over the last 24 hours, we have also seen violence spread elsewhere.
Some seek to justify this behavior as a response to inflammatory, despicable material posted on
the intemet. As I said earlier today, the United States rejects both the content and the message of
that video. The United States deplores any intentional effort to denigrate the religious beliefs of
others. At our meeting earlier today, my colleague, the foreign minister of Morocco, said that all
prophets should be respected because they are all symbols of our humanity, for all humanity.
But both of us were crystal clear in this paramount message: There is never any justification for
violent acts of this kind. And we look to leaders around the world to stand up and speak out
against violence, and to take steps to protect diplomatic missions from attack.
Think about it. When Christians are subject to insults to their faith, and that certainly happens,
we expect them not to resort to violence. When Hindus or Buddhists are subjected to insults to
their faiths, and that also certainly happens, we expect them not to resort to violence. The same
goes for all faiths, including Islam.

When all of us who are people of faith - and I am one — feel the pain of insults, of
misunderstanding, of denigration to what we cherish, we must expect ourselves and others not to
resort to violence, That is a universal standard and expectation, and it is everyone's obligation to
meet that, so that we make no differences, we expect no less of ourselves than we expect of
others, You cannot respond to offensive speech with violence without begetting more violence.
And I so strongly believe that the great religions of the world are stronger than any insults. They
have withstood offense for centuries. Refraining from violence, then, is not a sign of weakness in
one's faith; it is absolutely the opposite, a sign that one's faith is unshakable.
So tonight, we must come together and recommit ourselves to working toward a future marked
by understanding and acceptance rather than distrust, hatred, and fear. We can pledge that
whenever one person speaks out in ignorance and bigotry, ten voices will answer. They will
answer resoundingly against the offense and the insult, answering ignorance with enlightenment,
answering hatred with understanding, answering darkness with light; that if one person commits
a violent act in the name of religion, millions will stand up and condemn it out of strength.
In times like these, it can be easy to despair that some differences are irreconcilable, some
mountains too steep to climb; we will therefore never reach the level of understanding and
peacefulness that we seek, and which I believe the great religions of the world call us to pursue.
But that's not what I believe, and I don't think it's what you believe either here tonight. Part of
what makes our country so special is we keep trying. We keep working. We keep investing in
our future. We keep supporting the next generation, believing that young people can keep us
moving forward in a positive direction.
So tonight I think it's important that we talk not just about that better tomorrow that we all seek,
but also about some of the things — the real, practical, tangible things — that young people are
doing to help shape that better future.
Two years ago in this room, at our Eid reception, we launched a program called Generation
Change to lead a grassroots agenda of positive engagement with Muslim communities. And I
asked the young Muslim leaders in the audience that night to be our unofficial ambassadors, to
help build personal connections, seek out partners in other countries. And I can report to you
tonight they did not disappoint. In a few minutes, you're going to meet some of these young
leaders, each with a powerful story to tell.
The Generation Change network that started in this room now circles the globe. We are building
an international alliance of young people who want to drive change in their own communities.
They act as mentors, spark respectful debates, simply offer words of encouragement when

understanding and respect, one person at a time.

Even as we work to spread tolerance more broadly, we also are working to deepen our
appreciation for the experiences of others. Our 2012 Hours Against Hate initiative encourages
young people to put themselves in another person's shoes through service projects. So far, young
people from all over the world have pledged thousands of volunteer hours to help people from a
different background, to see them as a fellow human being, not a stereotype, not a caricature, but
another real live person — people who don't look like you, live like you, pray like you, but with
whom we will share this planet. And therefore, we have work to do.
People of faith and conscience are called to be the leaders of tolerance. In my tradition, like all
traditions, we are expected to love one another. And together, we have to translate that into better
understanding and cooperation. I'm particularly pleased that the young people you will hear from
tonight are really setting an example, not only for young people elsewhere in the world but,
frankly, for us who are older as well.
Let me now call to the stage someone who has been a tremendous assistance to me in these
efforts. Farah Pandith is the Department's first Special Representative to Muslim Communities.
And from the beginning, she has made reaching out to young people and civil society her top
priority. Farah will introduce you to three young leaders who I am very proud of
Remarks at the Transfer of Remains Ceremony to Honor Those Lost in Attacks in Benghazi, Libya
September 14, 2012
SECRETARY CLINTON: Thank you very much, Chaplain. Mr. President, Mr. Vice President,
Secretary Panetta, Ambassador Rice, Secretary Powell and Mrs. Powell, family members of the
four patriots and heroes we bring home, members of the State Department family, ladies and
gentlemen, today we bring home four Americans who gave their lives for our country and our
values. To the families of our fallen colleagues, I offer our most heartfelt condolences and
deepest gratitude.
Sean Smith joined the State Department after six years in the Air Force. He was respected as an
expert on technology by colleagues in Pretoria, Baghdad, Montreal, and The Hague. He enrolled
in correspondence courses at Penn State and had high hopes for the future. Sean leaves behind a
loving wife Heather, two young children, Samantha and Nathan, and scores of grieving family,
friends, and colleagues. And that's just in this world. Because online in the virtual worlds that
Sean helped create, he is also being mourned by countless competitors, collaborators, and garners
who shared his passion.
Tyrone Woods, known to most as Rone, spent two decades as a Navy SEAL, serving multiple
tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. Since 2010, he protected American diplomatic personnel in
dangerous posts from Central America to the Middle East. He had the hands of a healer as well
as the arms of a warrior, earning distinction as a registered nurse and certified paramedic. Our
hearts go out to Tyrone's wife Dorothy, and his three sons Tyrone, Jr., Hunter, and Kai, born just
a few months ago, along with his grieving faii)ily, friends, and colleagues.

Glen Doherty, who went by Bub, was also a former SEAL and an experienced paramedic. He too
died as he lived, serving his country and protecting his colleagues. Glen deployed to some of the
most dangerous places on Earth, including Iraq and Afghanistan, always putting his life on the
line to safeguard other Americans. Our thoughts and prayers are with Glen's father Bernard, his
mother Barbara, his brother Gregory, his sister Kathleen, and their grieving families, friends, and
colleagues.
I was honored to know Ambassador Chris Stevens. I want to thank his parents and siblings, who
are here today, for sharing Chris with us and with our country. What a wonderful gift you gave
us. Over his distinguished career in the Foreign Service, Chris won friends for the United States
in far-flung places. He made those people's hopes his own. During the revolution in Libya, he
risked his life to help protect the Libyan people from a tyrant, and he gave his life helping them
build a better country.
People loved to work with Chris. And as he rose through the ranks, they loved to work for Chris.
He was known not only for his courage but for his smile — goofy but contagious — for his sense
of fun and that California cool.
In the days since the attack, so many Libyans — including the Ambassador from Libya to the
United States, who is with us today — have expressed their sorrow and solidarity. One young
woman, her head covered and her eyes haunted with sadness, held up a handwritten sign that said
""Thugs and killers don't represent Benghazi nor Islam,"" The President of the Palestinian
Authority, who worked closely with Chris when he served in Jerusalem, sent me a letter
remembering his energy and integrity, and deploring — and I quote — ""an act of ugly terror.""
Many others from across the Middle East and North Africa have offered similar sentiments.
This has been a difficult week for the State Department and for our country. We've seen the
heavy assault on our post in Benghazi that took the lives of those brave men. We've seen rage
and violence directed at American embassies over an awful interne video that we had nothing to
do with. It is hard for the American people to make sense of that because it is senseless, and it is
totally unacceptable.
The people of Egypt, Libya, Yemen, and Tunisia did not trade the tyranny of a dictator for the
tyranny of a mob. Reasonable people and responsible leaders in these countries need to do
everything they can to restore security and hold accountable those behind these violent acts. And
we will, under the President's leadership, keep taking steps to protect our personnel around the
world.
There will be more difficult days ahead, but it is important that we don't lose sight of the
fundamental fact that America must keep leading the world. We owe it to those four men to
continue the long, hard work of diplomacy. I am enormously proud of the men and women of the
State Department. I'm proud of all those across our government, civilian and military alike, who

represent America abroad. They help make the United States the greatest force for peace,
progress, and human dignity the world has ever known. If the last few days teach us anything, let
it be this: That this work and the men and women who risk their lives to do it are at the heart of
what makes America great and good.
So we will wipe away our tears, stiffen our spines, and face the future undaunted. And we will
do it together, protecting and helping one another, just like Sean, Tyrone, Glen, and Chris always
did. May God bless them and grant their families peace and solace, and may God continue to
bless the United States of America.
And now, let me have the great honor of introducing someone who came to the State Department
earlier this week to grieve with us. He well understands and values the work that these men were
doing for our country. The President of the United States.
Remarks With Mexican Secretary of Foreign Relations Patricia Espinosa After Their
Meeting
September 18, 2012
SECRETARY CLINTON: Good afternoon, everyone. And it is such a pleasure for me to
welcome my friend and colleague, Secretary Espinosa, along with a very distinguished
delegation of officials from the Mexican Government for this continuation of consultation at the
highest levels of each of our governments.
Before I turn to the matters discussed today, let me give a brief update on the ongoing U.S.
response to the protests in the Middle East and elsewhere. I'm sure as you know already, we are
taking aggressive steps to protect our staffs in embassies and consulates worldwide. That
includes reviewing our security posture at every post and augmenting it where necessary. And
we are working closely with the Libyan Government in our efforts to bring to justice those who
murdered our four American colleagues in Benghazi.
The FBI is now in Tripoli to join the investigation with Libyan officials, and there is nothing
more important to us than ensuring the safety of our American representatives worldwide. At the
same time, as I have said to State Department employees, the incidents of the past week highlight
how important our work is. The United States must and will remain strongly engaged in the
world. Our men and women risk their lives in service to our country and our values, because they
know that the United States must be a force for peace and progress. That is worth striving and
sacrificing for, and nothing that happened last week changes this fundamental fact.
Now, turning to our friends and partners in Mexico, we are always pleased to have a chance to
discuss matters of mutual interest and concern between us. Mexico is one of our closest friends
as well as partner on dozens of critical issues. So we talk about every kind of issue you can
imagine, from education and healthcare to poverty alleviation to the environment. But today, we
focused on a top priority for us both a security.

We just co-chaired the fourth meeting of the U.S.-Mexico Merida High-Level Consultative
Group. This is the last one we will hold during the Calderon Administration. And I want to offer
my personal appreciation to President Calderon and to Foreign Secretary Espinosa for their
leadership and commitment to this partnership and to all on both sides of the border in our
governments who have been deeply engaged and committed to it. The Merida Initiative
represents an unprecedented level of security cooperation between Mexico and the United States.
As our countries continue to deal with the serious challenge of transnational criminal
organizations, including drug traffickers, illegal arms traffickers, money launderers, and violent
gangs that threaten people on both sides of the border, we well know there is no quick and easy
way to stop these criminals and bring them to justice. But nevertheless, during the past now
nearly four years, our countries have collaborated to an extraordinary and unprecedented degree.
We have brought together policy makers and experts from across our governments and societies
who have worked hand in hand to keep our people safe. And I think the habits of cooperation we
have built are among our most important achievements, and we will rely on them for a long time
to come.
Today, our delegations reviewed the gains we've made on key priorities, including improving
law enforcement coordination, reducing the demand for drugs, modernizing our border
infrastructure, strengthening the rule of law, and building more resilient and empowered
communities. We also discussed the lessons we've learned and the work that lies ahead in these
and other areas, which our joint statement will reflect. I want to underscore how important our
security relationship with Mexico is to the United States.
The Government of Mexico and the Mexican people have faced the threat posed by these
criminals with courage and resolve, and we remain committed to doing everything we can to
support Mexico as it continues to work to bring those criminals to justice. This is a transnational
problem, and it calls for a transnational solution, and the United States believes this is a matter of
shared responsibility. That was the first message I brought as Secretary of State when I came to
Mexico, and it continues to be the hallmark of our efforts together. Making sure our people are
safe and our neighbors are safe is of the utmost importance to us.
Now, our two countries share many other priorities, and one of them, empowering women and
girls, was also addressed today. We took the opportunity, the Foreign Secretary and I, to sign a
Memorandum of Understanding between our countries to work together to advance gender
equality, empower girls and women, promote their human rights, and enhance their security.
So again, Secretary Espinosa, let me thank you for years of work and effort, for our productive
conversations in many places around the world and again today, and for being such a valuable
colleague and partner. The United States deeply, deeply values our relationship with Mexico and
the ties of family and friendship that connect so many millions of our people.

And we look forward to the future. We believe strongly that presidential administrations may
change, elections will come and go, but we have established a firm foundation for cooperation
that has already benefited both our countries and which will continue to benefit both of our
countries for many years ahead. So thank you very much.
MS. NULAND: We'll take (inaudible). Margaret Brennan, CBS News.
QUESTION: Madam Secretary, thanks for your time. Are you any closer to finding who killed
Ambassador Chris Stevens?, Libya's President says this attack was planned for months. Are you
confident he's wrong and that security measures were appropriate? And will you leave justice to
the Libyans?
SECRETARY CLINTON: As I said at the outset, we are taking aggressive steps to protect our
people and our consulates and embassies around the world. We are reviewing our security
posture at every post and working with host governments to be sure they know what our security-
needs are wherever necessary. We are also working closely with the Libyan Government to bring
the perpetrators to justice so that we can be assured that we have found who murdered our four,
colleagues and under what circumstances. As I said, the FBI has joined the investigation inside
Libya, and we will not rest until the people who orchestrated this attack are found and punished.
It is also important to look at this strategically and understand what is going on across the region.
In a number of places where protests have tuned violent, we are seeing the hand of extremists
who are trying to exploit people's inflamed passions for their own agendas. But overwhelmingly,
we have found that the people of Egypt, of Libya, of Yemen and Tunisia are not prepared to
trade the tyranny of a dictator for the tyranny of a mob. They want to turn their attention to the
future to provide better opportunities for themselves and their children, and they want a strong
partnership with the United States and the American people based on mutual interests and mutual
respect.
This is part of a larger debate that is going on inside these societies. In Libya, for example, in
their first free elections, moderates were successful at the polls. But look, there are extremists in
all of these societies and on the outside who are working to take advantage of broad outrage in
order to incite violence and specifically incite violence against Americans and American
facilities.
And as I have said to many of the leaders I have spoken to over the past week, these extremist
efforts are a threat to the people of the societies and the governments of those societies as well as
to the region and the United States. And I think it's important at this moment for leaders to put
themselves on the right side of this debate - to speak out clearly and unequivocally against
violence, whoever incites it or conducts it
And in a struggle like this, there can be no doubt where the United States must stand. We support
those who are fighting for the same values and rights that we believe in - in democracy, in

freedom, in universal rights for men and women, for justice and accountability. And I want to
underscore that the United States will continue to work with partners and allies in the region and
around the world to help bring security to these nations so that the promise of the revolutions that
they experienced can be realized.
And finally, on your specific point about Benghazi, we obviously never talk publicly about
security at any of our missions for obvious reasons. But that said, let me assure you that our
security in Benghazi included a unit of host government security forces, as well as a local guard
force of the kind that we rely on in many places around the world. In addition to the security
outside the compound, we relied on a wall and a robust security presence inside the compound.
And with all of our missions overseas, in advance of September lid', as is done every year, we
did an evaluation on threat streams. And the Office of the Director of National Intelligence has
said we had no actionable intelligence that an attack on our post in Benghazi was planned or
imminent.
But let me state the obvious again. Our diplomats engage in dangerous work, and it's the nature
of diplomacy in fragile societies and conflict zones to be aware of the necessity for security but
to also continue the important diplomatic work that has to go on. There is risk inherent in what
we do and what these brave men and women representing the United States are up against every
single day, and we do our very best to limit that risk by ensuring that our security protocols
reflect the environments in which diplomats work and the threats that they are presented with.
Thank you.
Remarks With Indonesian Foreign Minister Raden Mohammad Marty Muliana
Natalegawa After Their Meeting
September 20, 2012
SECRETARY CLINTON: Good afternoon, everyone. And it's such a pleasure, as always, to
welcome the Indonesian Foreign Minister, and I believe the largest delegation that has ever come
from Indonesia, for the purpose of our third meeting of the U.S.-Indonesia Joint Commission.
This commission is the result of a vision by our two presidents for a comprehensive partnership,
and the agreement to that effect was signed in 2010. Thanks to this partnership, the United States
and Indonesia are working more closely than ever on a range of issues from global security to
clean energy and climate to regional trade and commerce.
And today, Marty and I had the chance to take stock of where our teams have come in the time
of the last year, because we liad our meeting in Bali a year ago. And I must say, I was very
impressed. We covered a great deal today.

But before I start, I'd like to say a few words about the protests in several countries around the
world. We have condemned in the strongest possible terms the violence that has erupted from
these protests. And as I have said, the video that sparked these protests is disgusting and
reprehensible, and the United States Government, of course, had absolutely nothing to do with it.
But there is no justification for violence, and I want to thank the Foreign Minister and his
government for speaking out against violence. We have to look to reasonable people and
responsible leaders everywhere to stand up to extremists who would seek to take advantage of
this moment to commit violent acts against embassies and their fellow countrymen.
Today's meetings have highlighted the strong foundation that we have built together. And one of
our most important concerns is promoting peace and stability in the Asia Pacific. Today, I'm
announcing that the Obama Administration has informed Congress of the potential sale of eight
AH-64D Apache Longbow helicopters to the Indonesian Government. This agreement will
strengthen our comprehensive partnership and help enhance security across the region.
On growth and prosperity, we are increasing our trade relationship that topped $26 billion last
year. Investments in transportation, energy, and infrastructure are creating jobs and supporting
economic growth in both countries. For example, the deal between Lion Air and Boeing alone
represents $21 billion in trade over the next decade. Indonesia's Government has announced half
a trillion dollars in infrastructure improvements, and we recently signed a memorandum of
understanding to make it easier for American companies to bid on these projects.
And yesterday, we signed an agreement for implementing our Millennium Challenge
Corporation Compact with Indonesia. Over the next five years, the United States will invest $600
million in clean energy development, child health and nutrition programs, and efforts to help
make Indonesia's Government more transparent and open.
The United States is also looking forward to Indonesia hosting APEC in 2013, and we are
confident that Indonesia will come to this role with a commitment to promote greater economic
integration across the Asia Pacific.
Both the Foreign Minister and I believe that strong education is essential to compete in a modem
global economy. That's why the United States has expanded the Fulbright Program and
supported partnerships between dozens of American and Indonesian universities. Academic
exchanges between our countries are up and applications from Indonesian students to visit the
United States have increased by one third. USAID has recently expanded its basic education
program to provide $83 million for teacher training and literacy programs for young children.
And we're providing $20 in scholarship funding for Indonesian graduate students.

I also thanked the Minister for Indonesia's leadership in ASEAN. The Foreign Minister's
personal leadership has helped lay the groundwork for diplomacy between ASEAN and China as
it relates to the South China Sea. And we continue to support ASEAN's six-point principles,
which we believe will help reduce tensions and pave the way for a comprehensive code of
conduct for addressing disputes without threats, coercion, or use of force.
Finally. Indonesia and the United States have stood together on a range of global challenges,
from democratic reform in Burma to combating climate change, to working to end the violence
in Syria. We are also coordinating efforts to further develop south-south and triangular
cooperation, such as enhancing disaster preparedness in Burma and convening a conference on
women's empowerment.
We believe that as the second and third-largest democracies in the world, the United States and
Indonesia have a special responsibility to promote democracy and human rights. And for the last
four years, Indonesia has hosted the Bali Democracy Forum to promote peaceful, democratic
transitions through example and open dialogue. Last year, more than 80 countries attended. And
once again, the United States will be sending a high-level delegation.
So, Minister, thank you for everything. Thank you for the great partnership we've had between
us and between our countries.
MS. NULAND: We'll take two questions today, we'll start with Ros Jordan of Al Jazeera
English.
QUESTION: Thank you, Madam Secretary, Mr. Foreign Minister. Madam Secretary, my
question is about the ongoing investigation into last week's attack at the consulate in Benghazi.
You are meeting this afternoon with members of Congress to discuss the progress and the
concerns that they understandably have. First, there is the federal mandate to establish an
accountability review board. Have you done so? Who would you like to see chair it? Are there
certain questions that you desperately want to have answered in order to safeguard the safety of
Foreign Service Officers around the world?
And related to this, given the political instability and the successes of the past year and a half, are
you satisfied that in light of those political changes, enough was done to protect those working in
the Middle East and North Africa? And then finally — and this is perhaps going into the area of
rumor and speculation — but there is at least one report suggesting that Ambassador Stevens felt
that he was on a, quote, ""al-Qaida hit list"" Is this a scurrilous rumor? Is this gallows humor
when one is working in a period of difficulty and great challenge, or is there something more to
what he allegedly — and I stress that word — said?

SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, first, let me say I'm looking forward to the opportunity to go
up to the Congress today. I will be briefing in two separate sessions, the House and the Senate, in
a classified setting, along with my interagency colleagues, as we continue to work together, and
with governments around the world, to ensure that our people and our facilities are safe. I will be
joined today by the Director of National Intelligence, General Clapper, by the Deputy Secretary
of Defense, Ash Carter, by the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Sandy Winnefeld,
along with experts from the FBI, the State Department, and elsewhere in the government.
Now, I anticipate that this briefing will cover our security posture before and during the events,
and the steps we have taken since to do everything we can with host governments to protect our
people and our embassies and consulates. The Director of National Intelligence will speak to the
intelligence issues surrounding these events in Libya. Deputy Secretary Carter will brief on the
superb support we have had from the U.S. military in the wake of these events, and we are at the
very early stages of an FBI investigation. The team from the FBI reached Libya earlier this week.
And I will advise Congress also that I am launching an accountability review board that will be
chaired by Ambassador Thomas Pickering.
I will also talk about the importance of the broader relationships with these countries in light of
the events of the past days. There are obviously very real challenges in these new democracies,
these fragile societies, but as I said last week, the vast majority of the people in these countries
did not throw off the tyranny of a dictator to trade it for the tyranny of a mob. And we are
concerned first and foremost with our own people and facilities, but we are concerned about the
internal security in these countries because ultimately, that puts at risk the men, women, and
children of these societies on a daily ongoing basis if actions are not taken to try to restore
security and civil order.
And let me just conclude by saying that there can be no doubt where the United States stands.
We continue to support those who are fighting for universal values — values that we see at work
in Indonesia — the third largest democracy in the world. We believe that these values of universal
rights, of justice and accountability, of democracy, are there for every person regardless of where
that person might live. So I will look forward to having a chance to talk with members of
Congress.
As to your final question, I have absolutely no information or reason to believe that there's any
basis for that.
QUESTION: Thank you.
MS. NULAND: Last question. Victoria Sidjabat from Tempo Magazine, please.

designed as a weapon to attack U.S. by raising sentiment anti-U.S. from the countries which has
Muslim majority population like Indonesia.
Madam Clinton, how do you see this threat as on the long run? If it's continuing happen, it's —
obviously could give impact to the implementation of (inaudible) program in Indonesia. What is
the reason U.S. Government closed the Embassy and Consulate in Indonesia? What is your
expectation from Indonesia Government, for my Minister Marty Natalegawa? How Indonesia
Government respond to the closing of this Embassy and Consulate, it's starting today? Is U.S. —
Indonesia Government has capability to protect U.S. Embassy and Consulate. So the (inaudible)
program implemented — could be implemented successfully in Indonesia. Thank you.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, let me begin by saying how grateful we are for the excellent
cooperation we have received from the Government of Indonesia, and in particular, from the law
enforcement and security institutions in Indonesia. We are very grateful for not only the
cooperation and protection that has been provided to our facilities, but also to the strong
statements condemning violence from the President, the Foreign Mihister, and others.
In consultation with the Government of Indonesia, we have temporarily, for tomorrow, closed
our facilities. We want to be sure that law enforcement in Indonesia has the ability to do what it
needs to do to make sure that there is no disruption of civil order and security. So we are
cooperating completely, and we're very grateful for the strong leadership provided by Indonesia.
FOREIGN MINISTER NATALEGAWA: Hello, (inaudible), if I may just also respond.
Precisely as the Secretary had said, the decision by the United States Government to close
temporarily its embassies and consulates tomorrow in Indonesia is a decision that's been made
based on communication and conversation between the authorities in Indonesia and the United
States as well. So in other words, it is an informed decision, a decision that is not intended to
show any unfriendly intent on the part of anyone, but it is what it is, and it's quite some — it's the
kind of step that governments actually carry out when situations requires it, even in our case.
Some of our embassies abroad, when the situation requires us to have a temporary closing of the
embassy, we do that as well. So it is something that is quite regular and something that is
actually coordinated as well.
But if I may just broaden the subject matter, I think as our President had said in the past,
Indonesian Government the Indonesian people, even, obviously cannot and would not condone
the — any acts of violence against diplomatic premises, against diplomatic personnel, because
that is, truly — would be a challenge to the efficient and a proper conduct of relations among
states. So that's our point of departure.
At the same time, of course, beyond the immediate issue of protection of the embassies, we have
still ahead of us the challenge of how to prevent the kind of situations where we are now at in

terms of the kind of incendiary and the kind of statements or, in this instance, films that cause —
that is now we have all deplored and condemned for these kind of activities not to be repeated.
So we have a lot of homework to work towards in the future as well.

Remarks With Pakistani Foreign Minister Hina Rabbani Khar Before Their Meeting
September 21, 2012
Good afternoon, and let me begin by welcoming Foreign Minister Khar on her first visit to
Washington as foreign minister. We've had the opportunity to meet in Islamabad and other
settings, but I am very pleased that we would have this chance to exchange views on our bilateral
relationship as well as regional and global issues.
I want to begin by addressing the events of the day and the past week. Today, we've once again
seen protests in several cities in Pakistan. Unfortunately, some of those protests have turned
violent and, sadly, resulted in loss of life. I want to thank the Government of Pakistan for their
efforts to protect our Embassy in Islamabad and consulates in Lahore, Peshawar, and Karachi.
And I want to be clear, as I have said on numerous occasions, the violence we have seen cannot
be tolerated. There is no justification for violence. Of course, there is provocation, and we have
certainly made clear that we do not in any way support provocation. We found the video that's at
the core of this series of events offensive, disgusting, reprehensible.
But that does not provide justification for violence, and therefore it is important for responsible
leaders, indeed responsible people everywhere, to stand up and speak out against violence and
particularly against those who would exploit this difficult moment to advance their own
extremist ideologies.
Yesterday afternoon when I briefed the Congress, I made it clear that keeping our people
everywhere in the world safe is our top priority. What happened in Benghazi was a terrorist
attack, and we will not rest until we have tracked down and brought to justice the terrorists who
murdered four Americans. And we are taking aggressive measures at all of our posts to protect
our staffs and their families along with locally employed people who provide so many important
contributions to the work of our missions.
The Foreign Minister and I will have a chance to cover a full range of subjects today, and it is no
secret that the past year and a half has been challenging for Pakistan and the United States. And
we still have work to do to get our bilateral relationship to the point where we would like it to be,
but we both recognize that we can achieve more when we work together on a focused agenda. So

today is the latest in a series of high-level meetings. Ambassador Marc Grossman has just
returned from consultations in Islamabad. I look forward to seeing President Zardari next week
at the UN General Assembly. At each meeting, we are working to identify the strategic goals we
share — and there are many — and the concrete actions we can each take to accomplish them.
Our number one shared priority remains pursuing our joint counterterrorism objectives to ensure
the security of American and Pakistani citizens alike. We face a common threat from a common
enemy, and we must confront terrorism and extremism together. Earlier this month, I designated
the Haqqani Network as a Foreign Terrorist Organization so we could make full use of every
available legal authority to end their deadly attacks. Pakistan's parliament has called for
expelling foreign fighters so that Pakistan's territory can be fully under control of the Pakistani
Government and cannot be used to launch attacks against other nations.
And the follow-through on this is challenging but necessary, and we look forward to working
with Pakistan as they continue to address these problems. We have both pledged to support a
secure, stable, and prosperous Afghanistan, which is vital for the security of the region. And I
want to thank Foreign Minister Khar for Pakistan's reopening of the NATO supply lines to allow
the movement of goods to Afghanistan.
We will discuss the successful first meeting of the Safe Passage Working Group in Islamabad
which brought together Afghan, Pakistani, and U.S. representatives to advance the peace process
in Afghanistan. The Pakistani Government's public call for insurgents to come forward and talk
with the Afghan Government was particularly important. We are ready to work together to build
on these steps, and we will continue our discussions through bilateral consultations and the U.S.-
Afghanistan-Pakistan Core Group.
Now, of course, our relationship goes far beyond our shared security concerns, and today we will
discuss the many other ways in which we work together, particularly to create economic
opportunity for Pakistanis. Foreign Minister Khar and I agree that we need to shift our economic
relationship from aid to trade and investment. We are working to help Pakistan attract more
private sector investment. We hope to finalize a bilateral investment treaty soon. And we've
created a Pakistan private investment initiative to help more of Pakistan's small and medium
sized companies get access to capital.
Over the past few years, we have seen Pakistan's civilian government begin to put down stronger
roots. And if elections proceed as planned next year, it will mark the first time in Pakistan's
history that a civilian-led government has served its full term. The United States supports
Pakistan's economic development, and we have said many times that we want to see democracy
succeed in Pakistan.

We also support Pakistan's sovereignty, but we are clear that all sovereign nations carry certain
obligations to protect the human rights of their citizens, to control their territory, to prevent
threats to their neighbors and the international community.
So we know that there is still much to be done, but I can assure the people of Pakistan that the
United States remains committed to this important relationship and we are confident we can
continue to move forward together one step at a time to reach our shared strategic objectives.
Thank you very much.
Remarks With Tunisian Foreign Minister Rank Abdessalem Before Their Meeting
September 21, 2012
SECRETARY CLINTON: Good morning. I am pleased to welcome the Foreign Minister from
Tunisia I'm looking forward to our meeting, We obviously have a great deal to discuss, and I
want to thank the Foreign Minister and the Government of Tunisia for their efforts over the last
week to help secure our Embassy and the American Cooperative School of Tunis following the
violent assaults of last Friday.
We are monitoring events closely today. There is no higher priority for President Obama and
myself than the safety of our people. We've taken a number of steps around the world to
augment security and to protect our personnel at diplomatic posts. And we are working closely
with host governments in this effort.
As I have said before and as is embodied in the Vienna Convention and other international
agreements, all governments have the duty, the solemn duty, to defend diplomatic missions.
They must be safe and protected places so that governments can exchange views and work on
many important issues, and leaders across the world must stand up and be counted in rejecting
violence and holding violent actors accountable.
We are working closely with the Government of Tunisia They have assisted us in enhancing the
security of our facilities. We've also discussed with them the imperative of bringing to justice
those responsible for these violent attacks. And we have offered and will continue to look for
ways that we can assist the new Government of Tunisia in ensuring the rule of law throughout
their country, first and foremost for the people of Tunisia themselves. We look forward to
continuing to build our hew partnership with the Tunisian Government and people. Our
relationship is built around the shared principles of all democracies — a commitment to
nonviolence, to tolerance, and inclusivity for all people, and to upholding the rule of law.
The Tunisian people have bravely put themselves on the road to democracy. They were the first
of the Arab revolutions and they have made important progress in a very short period of time.
They have worked too hard and sacrificed too much over too many years to see their progress
hijacked at derailed by extremists with Ulric own a5,-.

Tunisia but in too many places around the world, look for opportunities to exploit this current
situation or other situations, and all people and leaders must stand against them.
So as the Tunisian Government takes steps to strengthen security and protect the Tunisian people
and economy from extremism and violent agendas, the United States stands ready to help. We
also are working closely with Tunisia on the broader shared threat of terrorism, including from
groups like al-Qaida and its affiliates.
So Minister, please know the United States remains committed to supporting Tunisia as you deal
with this current situation, as you continue your democratic transition, and we want to be with
you as you confront challenges and help seize opportunities together for the betterment of the
future of Tunisia.

HEADLINE: It's not about Rice
BYLINE: Richard Cohen
BODY:
In 1953, an Army officer by the name of Irving Peress was promoted from captain to major. Peress was a
leftist, possibly a communist, and word of his advancement in rank reached Sen. Joseph McCarthy in
Washington. He asserted that the promotion proved the Army was ""soft on communism,"" and he launched an
investigation that transfixed the nation. Peress, by the way, was a mere dentist. He was the Susan Rice of his
day.
Rice, of course, is a much more substantial figure. She is the U.N. ambassador, a friend of Barack Obama's
and a member of his Cabinet. Still, the attack on her is so disproportionate to what she is accused of having
done - just what was it, exactly? - that as in the Peress case, you have to conclude that there is something more
at work.
At first, I thought we were witnessing just another example of Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) doing his
Rumpelstiltskin number - throwing a fit and stomping his feet. It was McCain who first leveled the solemn
charge that Rice had lied to the Sunday TV shows about the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya.
She had characterized it as a spontaneous riot when it was, in fact, a planned attack by a local al-Qaeda affiliate.
But Rice was hewing to the early line established by the intelligence community. If the CIA and others were
wrong - or deceptive - then so, inevitably, was she.
Just as surely as day follows night, McCain's broadside was echoed by Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.). It
was soon taken up by 97 Republicans in the House who found Rice unqualified to become secretary of state - a
post to which she has not been nominated. ""Ambassador Rice is widely viewed as having willfully or
incompetently misled the American public,"" they bellowed.
I think Rice would make a dandy secretary of state. She's close to the president, and that matters a great
deal. But she is also seen as overly political and that, as much as her version of Benghazi, is what troubles some
others. Oddly enough, Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.), a former presidential candidate and another potential
secretary of state, is seen as much more of a statesmen. He is indeed an independent foreign-policy thinker who
has, as in days of old, restored the prestige and importance of the Foreign Relations Committee, of which he is
chairman.
But the awful truth is that it hardly matters who Obama chooses. Foreign policy is run from the White
House and not the State Department. Hillary Clinton is about to retire, and while she has done a commendable

job at Foggy Bottom, we cannot expect the inevitable book by her to reveal a Clinton Doctrine. For the most
part, she executed, not initiated, foreign policy.
So what is this fuss all about? Not Rice, that's for sure. It has turned instead into an expression of unease
about Obarna's foreign policy and its politicization. The unfortunate Peress came to personify the government's
alleged indifference to the (equally alleged) communist infiltration of the military and virtually everything else
(with the possible exception of the American Legion), Similarly, Rice has become the personification of
unhappiness with the use of intelligence leaks to buff Obanaa's foreign policy image and the conducting of an
amorphous foreign policy. Like Churchill's famous pudding, it lacks theme.
Syria is an example. U.S. inaction has allowed the crisis to fester. Bashar al-Assad's regime might be
dusting off its formidable arsenal of chemical weapons, further evidence of how chaotic this crisis has become,
but much of the time the White House has just trailed after Turkey or France. The war has spread, a refugee
calamity has developed, 40,000 people have died, and jihadists have come to play a prominent role. The Obarna
administration has been as lethargic on Syria as it initially was with Libya.
This sense of an aimless foreign policy, one lacking any moral fervor (or fiber) irritates conservatives much
more than liberals. It certainly enrages McCain, who cannot stomach the big guys kicking little guys around. He
sees an administration that will not engage the American people on matters of foreign policy - make a case for
intervention, not just say it's too hard to do.
The attack on Rice is unfair and excessive. But the issue is not the person but what she represents - in this
case, the administration's 'mobility to articulate a foreign policy that marries American morality to American
power, not merely American politics.

Benghazi's Deep Throat fingers Islamist Leaders for
Attacks as State Dept Criticized on Consular Security
Posted on 12/19/2012 by Juan
The report saying that security was inadequate at the compound that the US had adopted as its ad hoc
consulate in 13enghazio Libya dominates today's headlines. That conclusion is obvious. The
""consulate"" was just a private residence taken over for this purpose by the US in the city, It was not
constructed to be a US government building in a potentially hostile city.
I met a person who worked there when I was in Benghazi in June, and she told me that it wasn't even
clear if the consulate would be retained after the first of this year It was possibly temporary,
depending on Congressional funding. (The Tea Party House hasn't been good on meeting requests for
embassy security funds).
The more interesting question than why ad hoc arrangements should have been made for a consulate
during and after the Libyan revolution (the answer to which seems fairly obvious) is, who is
responsible for the string of assassinations and acts of violence in the city, of which the RPG attack on
the consulate on September 11 was only one? Benghazi, with a population of over one million in a
country of 6.5 million, is Libya's second largest city and1/1
e'as the epicenter of the revolution against the
government of Muammar Qaddafi in 2011.
On November 22, Benghazi police chief Farej Darssi was assassinated. In October a police colonel
barely avoided death— his car was wired to explode, A Libyan intelligence officer was killed in
September. A general was assassinated in August. Some of these figures had worked for Qaddafi but
had defected to the revolution. Qaddafi's security forces were responsible for the 1996 massacre of
hardline fundamentalists at Abu Salim prison, and for making others just disappear, Likely the same
shadowy cells that attacked the US consulate are behind the attacks on Benghazi police and army
officers.
There may have been a break in the case. Last Saturday, Benghazi security forces loyal to the elected
government in Tripoli, captured a man they suspected of being involved with the groups behind the
violence. And, he appears to have been willing to spill the beans. So let's call him the Libyan Deep
Throat.
Deep Throat is so knowledgeable about the conspiracies facing the city and so dangerous to those
hatching them that the latter immediately attempted to spring him from jail.
On Sunday morning, militants attacked the police facility next to the holding cell where the man is
being detained. A policeman at that station died in a hail of bullets from the attackers, and they called
for back-up. The police car that sped to the scene as ambushed and three policemen in it were killed.
Still, the police stood their ground and fought off the assault, and they kept their valuable suspect in
custody, with all his valuable testimony.
Shortly after midnight, on Monday morning, small explosives were set off at the Garyounis police
station in Benghazi, damaging a couple of automobiles but otherwise doing little damage. Then
explosives were set off at al-Uruba police station, which also took sniper fire, but neither resulted in
casualties.

The police became vigilant, and they apprehended a shady-looking man skulking around near the al-
Hadaeg police station, finding him to have two rocket propelled grenades in his possession, which he
was apparently intending to fire at the station.
In other words, the capture of Libyan Deep Throat has set off a gang war on the police, who are being
informed by bombings and shootings that they must let their informant go or risk their
So what is Deep Throat saying? According to local journalist Mohamed Bujenah of the Libyan Herald,
a senior figure in the Benghazi police told him that the informant had fingered as many as 7
prominent Muslim fundamentalist leaders in connection with these attacks, of whom the police
named 6 explicitly:
1 Sufyan Ben Qumu, from the notoriously radical town of Derna, and a former prisoner at
Guantanamo
2.Ahmad Bukatela, leader of the ',Thai& Militia
3.Muhammad al-Zahawi, head of the Ansar al-Sharia militia
4.Muhammad al-Gharabi, a leader of the Rafallala al-Sahati Militia
5.Ismail Sallabi, another leader of Rafallah al-Sahati
6.Salim .Nabous, head of the Zawiya Martyrs' Brigade
It is just a newspaper article. We don't know if the informant actually named these individuals or if he
did so to escape torture, in which case we can't trust what he said. But if the allegations are true, there
is collusion among several hardline militias in the city to create instability in hopes of taking it over.
The new, elected, prime minister Ali Zeidan, has started asserting himself militarily. He closed the
country's southern borders against instability in the Sahel. He may well have some risky house
cleaning to do in Benghazi.

HRC has been a critical voice on Libya in administration deliberations, at NATO, and in contact group meetings — as well
as the public face of the U.S. effort in Libya. She was instrumental in securing the authorization, building the coalition,
and tightening the noose around Qadhafi and his regime.
February 25— HRC announces the suspension of operations of the Libyan embassy in Washington.
February 26 — HRC directs efforts to evacuate all U.S. embassy personnel from Tripoli and orders the closing of the
embassy.
February 26 -- HRC made a series of calls to her counterparts to help secure passage of UNSC 1970, which imposes
sanctions on Gaddafi and his family and refers Qadhafi and his cronies to the ICC
February 28 — HRC travels to Geneva, Switzerland for consultations with European partners on Libya. She gives a major
address in which she says: ""Colonel Qadhafi and those around him must be held accountable for these acts, which
violate international legal obligations and common decency. Through their actions, they have lost the legitimacy to
govern. And the people of Libya have made themselves
clear: It is time for Qadhafi to go — now, without further violence or delay."" She also works to secure the suspension of
Libya from membership in the Human Rights Council.
Early March — HRC appoints Special Envoy Chris Stevens to be the U.S.
representative to Benghazi
March 14— HRC travels to Paris for the G8 foreign minister's meeting.
She meets with INC representative Jibril and consults with her colleagues on further UN Security Council action. She
notes that a no-fly zone will not be adequate.

March 14-16 — HRC participates in a series of high-level video- and teleconferences
She is a leading voice for strong UNSC action and a NATO civilian protection mission.
March 17 —HRC secures Russian abstention and Portuguese and African support for UNSC 1973, ensuring that it passes.
1973 authorizes a no-fly zone over Libya and ""all necessary measures"" - code for military action - to protect civilians
against Gaddafi's army.
March 19— HRC travels to Paris to meet with European and Arab leaders to prepare for military action to protect
civilians. That night, the first U.S. air strikes halt the advance of Gaddafi's forces on Benghazi and target Libya's air
defenses.
March 24— HRC engages with allies and secures the transition of command and control of the civilian protection mission
to NATO. She announces the transition in a statement.

course of several days, all three devote aircraft to the mission.
March 29 — HRC travels to London for a conference on Libya, where she is a driving force behind the creation of a
Contact Group comprising 20-plus countries to coordinate efforts to protect civilians and plan for a post-Qadhafi Libya.
She is instrumental in setting up a rotating chair system to ensure regional buy-in.
April 14 — HRC travels to Berlin for NATO meetings. She is the driving force behind NATO adopting a communiqué that
calls for Qadhafi's departure as a political objective, and lays out three clear military objectives: end of attacks and
threat of attacks on civilians; the removal of Qadhafi forces from cities they forcibly entered; and the unfettered
provision of humanitarian access.
May 5— HRC travels to Rome for a Contact Group meeting. The Contact Group establishes a coordination system and a
temporary financial mechanism to funnel money to the TNC.
June 8 — HRC travels to Abu Dhabi for another Contact Group meeting and holds a series of intense discussions with
rebel leaders.
June 12 — HRC travels to Addis for consultations and a speech before the African Union, pressing the case for a
democratic transition in Libya.
Late June — HRC meets with House Democrats and Senate Republicans to persuade them not to de-fund the Libya
operation.
July 15 — HRC travels to Istanbul and announces that the U.S.
recognizes the TNC as the legitimate government of Libya. She also secures recognition from the other members of the
Contact Group.

Subject RE: Latest from HRC friend
Jake- Interesting report. Gene is closer to the action and I defer to him on the latest Jail-ian thinking
and machinations vis-a-vis the cabinet and INC. I hadn't heard about ENI-related corruption but
wouldn't be surprised.
On the federalism issue,. Jail is right to be concerned about eastern agitation for autonomy. A
cabinet chance won't solve that problem, though. Nor will recruiting Belhaj and Islamist fighters to
take on the Bardans. To the contrary, it would only lead to unwanted bloodshed - the large Obeid
tribe still nurses a serious grudge against Belhaj and his ilk for the Islamists' presumed role in killing their
beloved Gen. Yunis last July and would probably put up a fierce fight.
The cabinet and INC need to have a serious discussion with the Bargans - if they aren't already
doing so - about how power and resources are to be distributed in the new Libya. The Libyans held
similarly heated debates on this very topic in the early1950s as they held their first parliamentary
elections and drafted their constitution (there were actually violent skirmishes in connection with
those elections, and Washington delayed the arrival of the first US ambassador until after things had
calmed down). Hopefully the current leadership can negotiate these issues peaceably in the
corning months. Of course, we and the UN and our other partners should encourage them to do so.

Let me know your thoughts:
SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as the highest levels of
European Governments, and Western Intelligence and security services.
1.On April 17, 2012 Libyan National Transitional Council (NTC) President Mustafa Abdel Jalil stated to a close
advisor that he is considering when, or even if, to hold a vote of no confidence in the NTC regarding support for the
government of Prime Minister Abdel Rahman al-Keib. According to a source with access to the NTC leadership, Jalil
realizes that a majority of the Council members no longer support el-Keib and his cabinet of Western educated technical
experts. Jaili continues to believe that, for the moment, the most important issue facing the NTC is the federalist
movement toward a semi-autonomous state in the Eastern region of Cyrenaica (Barge in Arabic). This situation continues
to complicate the NTC efforts to stabilize the country. With this in mind, Jalil expressed concern that a dramatic vote of no
confidence for el-Keib will weaken the entire NTC by association. Instead, according to this source, Jalil is considering
delaying a CiOCISI011, possibly putting it off until an elected legislature is in place in the late summer or early fall of 2012.
2. (Source Comment: In the opinion of this individual, the NTC has been able to reach a temporary
understanding with the eastern federalists, allowing the separatists to administer their local regions, while deferring to the
NTC for national and international issues. The complicating factor at this point lies in reaching a determination regarding
who has authority over new contracts with oil companies and other international firms. As of the week of April 16, 2012,
no decision has been reached on this point. The bulk of the NTC leadership is drawn from Barge, and Jalil now believes
they can control the situation if they can establish an organized central government. In particular, Jalil, according to a
sensitive source, is increasingly confident that the eastern roots of the NTC will allow him to balance the federalist
movement against the need for a sense of national unity. In the opinion of this source, el-Keib's future depends on Jalil's
opinion of his capacity to deal with this complex situation.)
3. Minister of Defense Ousama al Juwali is viewed by Jalil as the most important western Libyan in el-Keib's
cabinet, and the President and the leaders of the NTC had hoped that he would be able to deal with the confused security
situation in Tripoli. However, while he did receive assurances from General Abdel Hakim Alamin Belhaj regarding
possible assistance from his Islamist troops if fighting broke out between the National Army and the militia's loyal to the
eastern federalists. Unfortunately, from Jalil's point of view, this effort seems to have emboldened Belhaj and heightened
tension between the eastern and western portions of the country. According to this source, after reviewing the federalist
problem, Dr Abd al-Nasser Shamata, the head of the Crisis Management for the NTC, believes that el-Keib, al Juwali, Oil
Minister Abdulrahman Ben Yezza, and the bulk of the cabinet should be replaced by people drawn from within the NTC,
individuals who are in touch with the concerns of the Libyan people of all tribes and political groups. In the opinion of this
source Jalil is factoring this position into his decision on el-Keib.
4. Regarding the existing relationships with international oil firms, Shamata told Jalil that for the most part the
existing fields are continuing to produce and the owners have worked out security arrangements with local political and
tribal leaders. However, since el-Keib and Ben Yezza have been unable to bring order to the national administration, it is
difficult for firms to initiate new projects, since it is not clear who has the authority or the desire to sign such
agreements. Shamata stated forcefully that the Prime Minister, whoever he is, must establish an orderly administration
before full advantage can be gained from the oil fields. In the meantime, Shamata warns that his office has found
evidence of corruption between local officials and international firms. In this regard, he stated that local representatives of
the Italian national oil firm (ENI) have made problematic arrangements with local officials in the western part of the
country, where their oil fields are located. He added that most of these ENI employees are Libyans, but he believes ENI
management in Italy is aware of this situation. Shamata pointed out, without additional comment, that Ben Yezza is a
long time senior official of ENI.
5. In the opinion this source, Shamata and Jalil are not planning to publicize these charges regarding ENI, at least
until they decide how best to move forward on el-Keib, whether to allow the Prime Minister more time to address his
problems, proceed with the vote of no confidence or quietly ask him to step down on his own.
6. (Source Comment: According to this source, el-Keib is under fire primarily as a result of his failure to bring
order to the National Army, disarm independent militias, and establish security throughout the country. The leading
opposition to el-Keib is based in the Political Issues committee of the NTC, and as many as 42 of the 73 active NTC
members will vote against el-Keib if Jalil brings this matter to a vote. The source warns that these numbers are provided
by members of this Political committee, who may have their own agenda. A two thirds majority is required for the no
confidence vote, however; several senior members of the NTC are reluctant to take such a step until a constituent
assembly has been elected. They do not want this to look like the decision of a small group of people.)

272,"Another report--
SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as the highest levels of
European Governments, and Western Intelligence and security services.
1. As of the morning of July 6, an individual with access to the information stated in confidence that Libyan National
Transitional Council (NTC) President Mustafa Abdel Jalil remains committed to a transfer of power to a popularly elected
government; however, he is prepared to ex-tend the life of the NTC as a guarantor of stability for the Libyan people
following the July 7, 2012 election for seats in a 200-member General National Congress (GNC). Jaifi realizes that 2.7
million Libyans have registered to vote and are generally anxious to replace the increasingly unpopular NTC. That said,
JAI expects the voting to lead to a period of confusion and he will not abandon his authority until the results are fixed.
2. Jalil is also frustrated by the fact that during its eight-month tenure of the administration of Prime Minister Abclel
Rahman el-Keib - who was appointed by the NTC was unable to provide solutions for Libya's long list of needs: a
functioning justice system, a reconciliation process for officials who served the old administration, the disarming of
militia, building functional national security forces, rebuilding destroyed areas, and delivering basic services such as
healthcare.
3. At the same time, outside of the oil sector, much of Libya's economy is stagnant, and in the opinion of Western
security officials, lacks the government's go-ahead to restart public sector infrastructure contracts. In addition,
international advisers and foreign investors are reluctant to return to an environment where the government will not
sign long term agreements and cannot guarantee security.
4.(Source Comment: According to an extremely sensitive source, Jalil continues to believe that this chaotic situation
should not be surprising. He regularly points out that eight months is not a sufficient amount of time to build functioning
institutions from the remnants of the regime of former dictator Muammar al Qaddafi. The old regime featured a
dysfunctional bureaucracy, idiosyncratic rule, and anti-institutionalism. Additionally, Jaill now re
Ializes that due to
pronounced incompetence and a lack of will to take unpopular decisions the el-Keib government also failed to make
progress in the few areas where it could have achieved meaningful change. The towns of Sirte and Tawargha are
representative of the situation in the countryside where people lost their homes in the conflict and have been living in
temporary camps with limited ability to register and vote in their home district. Jalil has been urged by contacts in the
French and Italian Governments to guarantee the rights of people across the country in particular, he has serious
concerns as to whether or not supporters of former dictator Muammar al Qaddafi in his hometown of Sirte will be
included in the future political processes of the new Libya; if they are not allowed to vote by local militiamen. At the
same time, the fighting between Libyan Arabs and Tebta tribesmen in the Kufra area threatens to prevent any voting
there. Jalil has been warned that the NTC regulations now state that members of the National Army are not allowed to
vote or run for office, which is a disincentive for armed militia brigade members to become legitimate soldiers.)
5.This well informed individual believes that despite these flaws, the new government created by the July 7 election will
eventually have the mandate to take the difficult decisions that can create a reconciliation process. Jalil will work to
maintain order in this transition period, and finally reach his goal of creating a situation where the government can
rebuild homes and restore sufficient law and order; allowing those in Sirte, Tawargha, Kufra, and throughout the rest of
the country to live in their hometowns, establishing a situation where a true civil society can develop.

6. Jail!, in conversations with the leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood (MB), and separately with liberal leader Ali
Tarhouni, has acknowledged that the central government's top priority must be security and that the NTC has been
unable to provide it. That said, Jail! and Minister of Defense Ousarna alefuwali have pledged to provide 30,000 to 40,000
security personnel for election day to prevent similar incidents to the July 1 attack on Benghazi's election headquarters.
In that case eastern federalists entered the building, where ballot papers were burned and ballot boxes destroyed.
Similarly, these federalist forces are suspected of the attack on July 5 that burned down Ajdabiya's main storage centre
for election materials.
7. In the opinion of this individual, although those responsible for the Benghazi attack were pro-federalist, it has not
been proven that they were members of the self-appointed Cyrenaican National Council (MC), whose military arm set
up a roadblock in Wadi al-Ahmar on Libya's major east-west highway to demand that Cyrenaica get as many seats in the
GNC as Tripolitania. Thus far, neither the CNC nor any other group has publicly stated that they intend to use violence to
disrupt the elections. (Note: Under the current system Tripolitania will have 120 seats in the GNC, Cyrenaica (Barge) 62,
and Fezzan in the South 18.)

292,"STATEMENTStatement on the Death of American Personnel in Benghazi, Libya
It is with profound sadness that I share the news of the death of four American personnel, in Benghazi, Libya yesterday.
Among them were United States Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens and Foreign Service Information Management
Officer, Sean Smith. We are still making next of kin notifications for the other two individuals. Our hearts go out to all
their families and colleagues.
A 23. year veteran of the Foreign Service, Ambassador Stevens died last night from injuries he sustained in the attack on
our office in Benghazi.
I had the privilege of swearing in Chris for his post in Libya only a few months ago. He spoke eloquently about his
passion for service, for diplomacy and for the Libyan people. This assignment was only the latest in his more than two
decades of dedication to advancing closer ties with the people of the Middle East and North Africa which began as a
Peace Corps Volunteer in Morocco. As the conflict in Libya unfolded, Chris was one of the first Americans on the ground
in Benghazi. He risked his own life to lend the Libyan people a helping hand to build the foundation for a new, free
nation. He spent every day since helping to finish the work that he started. Chris was committed to advancing America's
values and interests, even when that meant putting himself in danger.
Sean was a husband and a father of two, who joined the Department ten
years ago. Like Chris, Sean was one of our best. All the Americans
we lost in yesterday's attacks made the ultimate sacrifice. We condemn this vicious and violent attack that took their
lives, which they had committed to helping the Libyan people reach for a better future.
America's diplomats and development experts stand on the front lines every day for our country. We are honored by
the service of each and every one of them.

I am chairman of AEG. I need your advice on a few matters. Is there a time that would be convenient for me to call or
visit you? I shall be in DC Thursday evening through Monday. Please let me know if anything works. Thanks.

Odds On the Big A <http://leftatthegate.blogspot.com/2009/09/odds-on-big.html>
Even as Governor Paterson reportedly has his recommendation on the Aqueduct racino in hand (this reader says
that he actually has two to consider <http://leftatthegate.blogspot.com/2009/09/sunday-morning-notes-and-
nuts.html#comment-1156672372250588546> ), at least one of the bidders is still taking its case to the local community
around the track. The Queens Chronicle reported last week
<http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=20368289&BRD=2731&PAG=461&dept_id=574908&rfi=6> that SL
Green/Hard Rock made a presentation on Thursday.
""Hard Rock is the right balance,"" [Pres/CEO Marc] Holliday said. ""Its recognized brand and quality entertainment
will attract younger and older players across the stratum. People flying in from JFK will say, 'I hear there's a Hard Rock, I
want to see it.""
One of this group's big pitches is that they'll be the first to generate a revenue stream (""shovel-ready, in the
ground, the day after the award."")
And thanks to the reader who alerted us to this article in Crain's
<http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20090913/FREE/309139964> which, more importantly than comprising yet
another virtual press release for Steve Wynn, contains, towards the bottom, a handy pocket guide to the six bidders, the
financial portion of their bids (or at least what is known about them), and the ups and downs of their proposals.
This is a tough call; handicapping without the Form as I said before. I can't say I have a favorite; neither a
particular personal preference, nor a clue as to the most likely winner. But I'll give it a shot and take the Crain's piece
one step further by coming up with a morning line.
<http://1.bp.blogspot.com/yiJ1ri4LCfk/Sq2_nTNU jI/AAAAAAAABHM/UucITWnkilM/s1600-
h/dont_bother.jpg> Aqueduct Entertainment Group <http://www.aqueductentertainment.comk (3-1): Competitive bid
of $251 million (contingent on 7,650 machines; $301 million with 10,000), a plethora of local connections on the real
estate/construction side, and approval by local unions could compensate for the lack of brand name recognition of
gaming partner The Navegante Group. Presence of Senator Malcolm Smith's longtime confidante Rev. Floyd Flake
doesn't hurt either.
SL Green/Hard Rock (4-1) - Boosted its bid to $275 million, and has the Hard Rock brand name as mentioned
above. Manhattan-based realtor SL Green has been endorsed by several local unions
<http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3601/is_43_54/ai_n27894917/> . But, as mentioned by Crain's, they were
passed over in favor of Delaware North the first time around.
Aqueduct Gaming (6-1), Buffalo-based Delaware North's group, has rallied late with a stepped-up publicity effort
and a major community initiative <http://leftatthegate.blogspot.com/2009/08/back-in-game.html> after appearing
indifferent early on (though it's original $100 million upfront offer remains intact with an additional $200 million to
follow). The addition of Harrah's <http://www.marketwire.com/press-release/Aqueduct-Gaming-L1c-1034906.html>
adds an experienced operator and an interesting cross-marketing twist which is probably not allowed under the now-
disappeared MOU. And, like the two bidders above, Aqueduct Gaming has been reported to have reached
accommodations with the unions. So I listed them as the third choice on these merits. However, a part of me wants to
list them as the rank outsider - I'd be pretty damn shocked if the state goes back to the company which dropped out
after failing to raise the money last time. And, as I've mentioned several times, given the reports of an investigation
<http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2009/05/01/2009-05-
01_attorney_general_andrew_cuomo_subpoenas_contracts_won_by_clients_offirm_tied_to.html> by Attorney
General Andrew Cuomo into lobbyist Patricia Lynch's dealings with the Assembly Speaker, I don't know if her
involvement here is going to help or hurt.
Steve Wynn (8-1) has offered $300 million, but he was the only bidder of the six contenders to receive a bad
grade from the hotel unions <http://www.timesunion.com/AspStories/story.asp?storylD=838256&category=STATE> as
reported by Jim Odato in the Times Union last week. Whatsmore, the scale of his building proposal
<http://www.queenstribune.com/news/1250798405.html> is laughably ridiculous, and it wouldn't be ready until 2011.
He'd be the favorite if the decision is based on the number of newspaper and online articles
<http://leftatthegate.blogspot.com/2009/08/all-wynn-all-of-time.html> each bidder has been featured in. But, quite
simply, he sometimes comes off as a nut
<http://www.nypost.com/p/pagesix/cindy_adams/wynn_hopes_to_win_racefor_race_hzqJ384wLxUSxFKsUWiSyM> .
Penn National (12-1) might be worth a ducat at long odds. No local connection here makes them a dark horse.
But a $250 million bid (as reported elsewhere <http://blog.timesunion.com/capitol/archives/17717/penn-national-
lobbies-up/> though not in the Crain's piece) puts them in the ballgame, and the company is an experienced gaming
operator with a solid balance sheet
<http://www.businessweek.com/investor/content/aug2009/pi20090814_742719.htm> which would probably do as
competent a job as anyone else.
R. Donahue Peebles/MGM Mirage (20-1) didn't increase its $150 million bid, and doesn't have a lobbyist; good
luck with that. Whatsmore, no local flavor and MGM Mirage has had some well-publicized financial woes (though things
have been looking up of late <http://online.wsj.com/article/SB125212120561188377.html> ). Would be a major
surprise.

Torture on homefront cries out for justice
Comments <http://www.suntimes.com/news/marin/1734591,CST-EDT-caro126.article>
August 26, 2009
BY CAROL MARIN <mailto:cmarin@suntimes.com> Sun-Times Columnist
The feds can't -- just yet -- deport Michigan restaurateur Ibrahim Parlak to his native Turkey. But they are frighteningly
closer.
And the irony screams out.
Carol Mann
On Monday, the same day Eric Holder, President Obama's attorney general, announced he would appoint a special
counsel to investigate whether torture was used by the CIA to extract confessions from foreign suspects, a U.S. appeals
court at the behest of the U.S. government ruled that it didn't have a problem sending Parlak back to the country where
he was tortured -- imprisoned for 17 months, shocked with electrodes, hung by his arms and sexually violated.
A Turkish Kurd, Parlak was granted political asylum in 1992. It was before our government got cozier with Turkey, before
it re-classified some of the Kurdish separatist movement as ""terrorist"" and before the attacks of Sept. 11. With 9/11,
Ibrahim Parlak's horror began anew.
Suddenly he looked different to the newly created Department of Homeland Security and to the Justice Department's
Immigration courts. Instead of seeing a hard-working, tax-paying Chamber of Commerce member who ran Cafe Gulistan,
a small Middle Eastern restaurant in the resort town of Harbert, Mich., tlie feds now saw an international menace.
In 2004, the FBI grabbed Parlak and locked him up.
If it hadn't been for a volunteer team of lawyers, including a Reagan-appointed former U.S. attorney, a former FBI anti-
terrorism legal adviser and the bipartisan intervention of Michigan's Sen. Carl Levin, a liberal Democrat, and Rep. Fred
Upton, a conservative Republican, Parlak would still be in jail.
Thanks to them, this 47-year-old father of a 12-year-old girl is temporarily free. But just barely.
The newest outrage is the 2-1 decision issued by Cincinnati's 6th Circuit Court of Appeals on the same day Holder
launched his torture inquiry.
B5
The majority opinion was issued by two Bush appointees put on the bench after 9/11. Judge Julia Smith Gibbons and
Judge Jeffrey Sutton upheld the Justice Department's Immigration courts ruling that Parlak failed to disclose his
relationship to the now-labeled terrorist organization even though he was never proven to be a member.
Let's remember something about our immigration courts. They are not independent. They work for whoever is the
attorney general. And the past rulings against Parlak came under two now-controversial Bush appointees, John Ashcroft
and Alberto Gonzales.
The fairness of immigration rulings has been ripped by none other than Judge Richard Posner of the 7th Circuit Court of
Appeals, one of the nation's most brilliant judges. By September of 2005, Posner noted ""a staggering 40 percent of the
136 petitions"" had been reversed due to, according to one ruling, a willingness to ignore ""the most basic of facts.""
Echoing Posner now is the dissenting judge on the Parlak appeal. Judge Boyce F. Martin, a Carter appointee, writes with
both clarity and conviction, arguing the government's ""awesome power was used here to railroad a man out of our
country.""
Like a surgeon, Martin dissects the Justice Department's immigration courts and the majority opinion of his own
colleagues, and ends by saying, ""I remain hopeful, nevertheless, that this case is but a sad remnant of an era of paranoid,
overzealous, error-riddled and misguided anti-terrorism and immigration enforcement that has now gone by the
wayside. It is just a shame that, even if my hope proves true, it is too late for Ibrahim Parlak.""
Parlak's legal team will appeal.
Meanwhile, Holder, like Ashcroft and Gonzales before him, is the new boss of the immigration courts.
As he investigates questions of U.S. torture abroad, here's hoping Holder examines the ongoing domestic legal torture of
Ibrahim Parlak.","['Michigan', 'Turkey', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'Turkey', 'Middle', 'Eastern', 'Harbert', 'Mich.', 'U.S.', 'Michigan', 'U.S.']"

schedule is bruising. But you probably need more strategy time, less events as the ultimate judgment will be on •
whether iran, nk get the bomb, progress in Mideast, success in Afghanistan, Iraq. Obama's pause on Afghanistan goes
well with elite media and left that is against all wars, but not with swing male voters who are defecting. And I think it is
making the rest of your job much tougher because the delay in the decision is looking Carterlike to US adversaries — any
decision is better than no decision. But all roads likely lead to Iran and perhaps Pakistan, rest is secondary at this point.
That's my view for what it's worth. Take care.","['Mideast', 'Afghanistan', 'Iraq', 'Afghanistan', 'US', 'Iran', 'Pakistan']"

Dear Phil, Jim and Richard,
First, Happy Thanksgiving! I am making FM calls re Afghanistan which are going well and the memcons will describe the
specific responses for our followup, especially in Athens and Brussels.
Below is a memo from a concerned observer about the British feeling alienated from us.
/Let me know what you each think. Thx.
Consensus across the board in Britain—center, right, left—is that the Atlantic alliance—the special relationship—the
historic bond since World War II—is shattered. There is no dissenting voice, not one, and there are no illusions. Opinion
is unanimous. The bottom line is that the Obama administration's denigration of the UK is seen as the summation of the
Bush era.
Undoubtedly, you saw this week Minister of Defense Bob Ainsworth's public criticism of Obama's indecision and his
accusation that the president is indifferent and damaging to British interest. While Downing Street sought to ameliorate
his remarks with an oleaginous statement his view is simply what everyone—everyone—thinks. His clumsy outburst was
a classic gaffe—an embarrassing mistake because it reveals something true.
The Chilcot inquiry of Parliament, publicly conducting hearings on the origins of UK involvement in the Iraq invasion,
has put Bush's war on terror—and British involvement—on trial—and the calmly conducted but eviscerating hearings
will go on for another year. Blair is seen as either complicit on the basis of knowing there was no casus belli or as an
enthusiastically deceived tool. Nick Clegg, leader of the Liberal Democrats, has stated that the reason support for the
Afghanistan mission has cratered is because of the lies told in the run-up to the Iraq war—another view universally held.
Meanwhile, former UK ambassador to the US Christopher Meyer has published his new book on the history of UK
diplomacy with concluding sections on the demise of the special relationship. He is not only being interviewed on all
British media but also has appeared as a voluble witness before the Chi!cot commission. All British newspapers and
journals have prominently published many pieces within the last week on the decline and fall of the US-UK relationship.
Please see the lead editorial today from the London Times and the cover story from the Spectator—two of the most
resolutely pro-American sources. The tone is not resentful, but reserved, disdainful and superior. The US administration
is considered blinkered, parochial and counter-productive.
Conservatives are more contemptuous than Labour, which feels abandoned and somewhat baffled. Rather than eager
to be Obama's poodle, Cameron would be superficially friendly and privately scornful. Class has a lot to do with the
contempt. A Cameron government would be more aristocratic and even narrowly Etonian than any Conservative
government in recent history, sharply contrasting especially with the striving and classless perspective of the grocer's
daughter, Margaret Thatcher.
And yet, the most recent poll this week showed Labour within striking distance of the Tories, about five points down,
the result of a slight economic uptick. A hung parliament seems very possible. Given the distribution of voting patterns,
Labour need not win a plurality to have more seats than the Tories.
The slight buoyancy for Labour in this unique situation has only heightened anxiety about Obama's Afghanistan
process, which has excluded the British government from significant consultation and consideration of its interests. See
the lead to Con Coughlin's Spectator piece.
Therefore, the President might contemplate a brief stop in London going to or coming from Oslo or a meeting in
Copenhage to make a public appearance with Brown. And, others in the Administration should pay special attention to
Brown to secure strong support from him, and more importantly, the whole government and British establishment
should be reassured that we do value their stalwart support despite the ups and downs of the last eight years.
Pasted below is the Times editorial and the link to the Spectator article.
From The Times
November 26, 2009
Atlantic drift
Washington's delay in announcing its Afghanistan strategy has left Brown drifting. Obama needs to invest more time and
attention in the transatlantic alliance President Obama declared on Tuesday that ""the whole world"" had a responsibility
to help the US-led mission in Afghanistan. He would, he said; soon lay out the ""obligations of our international partners"".
Those partners have been waiting a long time for the details. On Monday the President had his tenth meeting with his
advisers to work out his strategy for Afghanistan. He has now spent almost three months considering his options, and
has promised an announcement on deployments after the Thanksgiving holiday.
For Gordon Brown, this cannot come too soon. After the United States, Britain is the largest contributor of troops to the
Nato operation in Afghanistan. There has never been any suggestion that Britain has enough soldiers to pursue a
separate strategy or that it can operate independently of the US forces, which already number some 68,000 troops.
Until the White House decides whether to send an extra 40,000 or some figure significantly lower than the number
requested by General Stanley McChrystal, Mr Brown cannot properly plan the best support strategy.
It is becoming sadly apparent that Britain has been left drifting by the delays in Washington, and that the Obama
Administration is largely unaware of the embarrassment this is causing the Government. More worryingly, this does not
seem to be a source of concern within the Administration. Downing Street, diplomatically, turns aside any suggestion
that it is frustrated by the nonchalance with which it is being treated. But the insistent questions on Afghanistan, the
anger caused by the steady stream of returning war dead and the rapid crumbling of public support for the war cannot
be answered effectively until Mr Brown is taken into American confidence and seen as a full partner in the Nato
campaign.
On the surface, the continuing high regard in Britain for the dynamic and articulate new President has masked these
growling complaints. Mr Brown is not suffering, as his predecessor did, from the taint of close association with a deeply
unpopular US president. On the contrary: like several European leaders, he is still eager to position himself as close as
possible to Mr Obama to clothe himself in some of the President's European popularity. But within Government, there is
already worry that Britain's voice counts far less than it did in the past. This is not simply another instance of the
persistent but pointless British anxiety over the so-called special relationship; it is a justified concern that two of the
main pillars of the Nato alliance should have policies and strategies that are closely co-ordinated and sympathetically
understood on both sides when fighting a war.
The fault, glaringly, is on the American side. The White House no longer seems to be monitoring the reactions and
political options of its transatlantic allies. It is not sufficient to suggest that the Administration sees little point in
investing time and diplomacy in a British government likely to be defeated in the coming general election; wartime allies
have interests that go far beyond the political make-up of the government of the day. Mr Obama promised during his
election campaign to revive trust in American leadership and to re-engage in multinational diplomacy. In office, he has
certainly voiced the same ideals; but he has invested little in giving new substance and dynamism to the transatlantic
relationship.
On Afghanistan, Mr Brown has sometimes been left speechless by Washington. He talks of sending 500 extra troops. But
until he knows the likely US strategy, he cannot outline his own. Atlanticism is always fragile on the Left and was
stretched to breaking point by Tony Blair. It is now being undermined by indifference in Washington. Today America is
enjoying Thanksgiving. Tomorrow it must look out again to its all

Thanks for all your hard work on this difficult speech to get it as right as possible. Here are a few comments and
questions:
We need to work in reference and quotes from POTUS Nobel speech near the top. I haven't read it yet so not sure
what's most appriopriate. Since the speech alluded to some of the same ground, should we be explicit in asserting that
this speech further clarifies/expands/explains what this Admin means by human rights?
The points about us not being perfect and the existence of evil in the POTUS speech should be woven in more here
too. For example, in discussion on p.7 about Japanese internment, etc.
In the section about supporting individual defenders, should mention that we did that thru State Dept ceremony
honoring brave women and applaud others like Vital Voices and RFK memorial who do same. Tell story about how I was
asked to mention the name of a Guatemala activist in my sppech to the parliament there because the attention might
literally save her life.

E-diplomacy? Hillary Clinton Embraces New Media By MATTHEW LEE AP Sat, Mar 21, 2009
WASHINGTON (AP) — Her videos aren't quite viral yet and she's not tweeting, but Secretary of State Hillary Rodham
Clinton is embracing new media, using the Web to promote the agency and her role as the nation's top envoy.
In less than three months, Clinton's State Department has embarked on a digital diplomacy drive aimed at spreading the
word about American foreign policy and restoring Washington's image. Part of a broader Internet outreach by President
Barack Obama's administration, Clinton's Web efforts already have outpaced those of her predecessors.
Since taking over at Foggy Bottom, Clinton's team has built on e-diplomacy innovations developed during George W.
Bush's presidency:
- They have revamped the department's Web site (http://www.state.gov) and the Dipnote blog (http://blogs.state.gov
and http://twitter.com/dipnote) with a fresh array of features, graphics and colorful posts.
- Users can track her foreign travel on an interactive map (http://www.state.gov/secretary/trvI/map/?trip_id5)
- They can keep up virtually with her every move through Facebook, Twitter, Flickr and YouTube
(http://www.youtube.com/user/statevideo).
- They can pose questions through an ""ask-the-secretary"" column
(http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/ask/secretary/117297.htm) that recently was revised to ""text the secretary.""
(http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/ask/secretary/120236.htm)
""New media is critical in this new era of diplomacy, where smart power and expanded dialogues are essential to
achieving our foreign policy goals,"" said Cheryl Mills, Clinton's longtime confidante and chief of staff.
Even for a government Web site, early indications show a surge in interest, according to internal State Department
statistics provided to The Associated Press.
Daily views of the Dipnote have doubled from 10,000 a year ago to 20,000 today, with 700 subscribers to its RSS feed,
twice as many as in March 2008. The number of followers of the department on Twitter has tripled since Jan. 20, when
Obama took office, while the department's Facebook friends have increased by 2 1/2 times in the same period.
8
""What they are bringing in is more willingness to experiment,"" said Peter Daou, who was Clinton's Web guru during her
2008 presidential run. ""They are starting to push the envelope.""
What remains unclear, though, is whether the spike in interest reflects the revamped Web site or the public's fascination
with Clinton's latest career shift.
""The personality behind it can't be dismissed,"" said Daou, who now blogs on human rights and other issues for U.N.
Dispatch (http://www.undispatch.com).
Like Obama, Clinton carries a Blackberry, but she is not allowed to use it on the department's secure seventh floor
where her office is. Aides say she takes an active role in answering questions from the Web, responding to bloggers and
pushing her agency's new media agenda.
""The United States Government is behind nearly everybody, except in certain discrete areas, in terms of technology,""
she told department employees at a town hall meeting in February. ""We are, in my view, wasting time, wasting money,
wasting opportunities, because we are not prepared to communicate effectively with what is out there in the business
world and the private world.""
Clinton was quick to embrace new media at the start of her presidential campaign. She announced her entry into the
race in February 2007 on the Web and followed with regular Internet chats and Internet fundraising appeals.
Nonetheless, Clinton was surpassed by the Obama campaign's mastery of the Internet and social networking sites.
Obama used the Web to raise record donations and identify and orchestrate an army of volunteers.
Clinton was first lady when the first White House Web site debuted in 1994. It was a bare-bones operation compared
with what is available now. Three years later, the State Department went online during Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright's tenure.
But it wasn't until 2007, under Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice's spokesman, Sean McCormack, that the
department's public affairs shop began exploring new media in earnest. McCormack started the Dipnote blog, which
some foreign service veterans predicted would fail, given the private and stuffy nature of diplomacy.
The site endured under Rice. Clinton has retooled Dipnote with a Twitter feed and a broader range of posts from
diplomats.
It's more than just window dressing. This past week, diplomats used Twitter to ""tweet"" down false rumors they feared
might lead to a siege on the U.S. Embassy in Madagascar.
On her first two foreign trips, to Asia and then the Middle East and Europe, local bloggers were ""embedded"" with the
traveling press corps, broadening the audience for Clinton's official meetings and public appearances, which often
produce more personal than policy questions.
On her question site, Clinton has responded to a varied questions, from ""Should the U.S. engage in direct dialogue with
Hamas?"" to ""How did you like meeting the Japanese students?""
By the end of Clinton's trip to the Mideast, her ""text the secretary"" feature had received nearly 2,000 text messages. On
both trips, Clinton also participated in Webcasts. One in Beijing on climate change generated more than 10.2 million
page views, more than 50,000 comments and 7,000 questions, according to the statistics.
Clinton's staff say they plan to venture further into the realm of social networking, an animated online world called
Second Life, and cell phone technology. The department hopes to follow through on a Bush administration organized
9
project that brought together Facebook, Google, Howcast, YouTube, AT&T, MTV, Columbia Law School, Access360Media
and Gen-Next for an Alliance of Youth Movements summit.
It also wants to expand on X-Life, a mobile phone game launched in February that is aimed at helping youth in the
Middle East learn English and teaching them about American history, culture and values.

SECRETARY OF STATE HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON REMARKS TO THE HAITI DONORS CONFERENCE Washington, D.C.
Tuesday, April 14, 2009
For some of us, Haiti is a neighbor. For others, a place of historic and cultural ties. For all of us, a test of collective
commitment and resolve.
Some may ask why a small nation in the middle of the Caribbean Sea should command our attention today. Why
countries in the Western Hemisphere, Europe, the Middle East and Asia should offer assistance to Haiti in the midst of a
global economic downturn that has shaken us all.
We're gathered at this conference because what happens in Haiti will resound far beyond the Caribbean and beyond the
Americas. The success or failure of this one small nation has economic, social and political implications, not just for its 9
million citizens, but for a region whose future will be shaped by the strength of our commitment to achieve economic
recovery, political progress and wider opportunity for people from Portland to Porto Alegre to Port-au-Prince.
The United States is here, first and foremost, because it is the right thing to do for our neighbor and friend. Our ties to
Haiti reach back to the early years of both our nations and have endured for generations-through our struggles for
independence; through the defeat of slavery in Haiti, which inspired slaves and abolitionists in the U.S. to press on with
their fight for freedom; and more recently, through the hundreds of thousands of Haitians who emigrated to the United
States and strengthened it through their contributions in politics, business, science, sports and culture-the benefits of
which I experienced firsthand as a senator representing New York.
We are also here because we are committed to creating a hemisphere in which every nation-no matter their present
level of wealth or current political circumstances-is moving in the same direction, toward greater peace, prosperity,
freedom and opportunity.
With Haiti, we have the chance through global cooperation and collaboration to stand in solidarity with a people who
are seeking to march forward. A nation where small investments and assistance from other countries are beginning to
reap dividends in economic growth, wider access to health care, stronger governmental institutions, greater safety and
security-and the higher quality of life that results when the material conditions of people's lives improve.
Today, Haiti is the poorest nation in the hemisphere, with one of the region's biggest gaps between the haves and have-
nots. But in 2006, Haiti had its highest economic growth since the 1990s. It is on track to reach the completion point for
the IMF's Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative in the next few months, which means significant debt relief is on the
way, which will free up approximately $4 million a month-money that Haiti can invest directly in improving the lives of
its people and building a future of self-sufficiency and confidence.
Haiti has the region's highest rate of HIV/AIDS, the highest rate of maternal mortality, and the highest rate of child
mortality. But the numbers of HIV infections and child and maternal deaths are all coming down.
Not long ago, Haiti endured three decades of a brutal dictatorship. But the national and presidential elections in 2006
jump-started Haiti's democracy, and President Preval and Prime Minister Pierre Louis are seeking to maintain a strong
commitment to democratic governance, which will take another step forward on Sunday with elections for the Senate.
Like many nations, including the United States, Haiti struggles against crime, particularly the global scourge of drug
trafficking. But reforms to improve policing, strengthen the justice system and fight corruption are now underway, and
a peacekeeping force led by Brazil has helped bring stability to many Haitian communities.
Haiti made these strides with help from its own citizens and many of the nations and institutions represented here
today. And this progress did not come only through government-to-government partnerships, but also through links
among businesses, universities, NG0s, religious and cultural groups, and individuals-the full range of resources and
relationships, which is the heart of smart power.
That trajectory of progress has been undermined by the combined winds of hurricanes and a global economic recession.
Haiti is in danger of stalling.
This conference gives us an opportunity to reignite its path to progress and work as a team-with Haiti at the helm-to
advance a comprehensive, long-term strategy for Haiti's growth, by coordinating hemispheric and international efforts,
targeting clear goals, and deploying our diverse skills and resources efficiently and effectively.
President Preval and Prime Minister Pierre Louis have identified what help Haiti needs to get back on track. With these
priorities as our guide and Haiti as our partner, we can make high-impact investments that will help lay the foundation
for stronger democratic institutions, a vibrant civil society, and an open market economy that creates more stability,
attracts international investment, and offers more jobs and wider economic opportunities for Haiti and our region as a
whole.
Now is the time to step up our investment in Haiti-not because the situation is so dire, but because the consequences of
inaction could lead to significantly larger costs in both human and financial terms down the road.
With $100, we can pay for a year of schooling for one Haitian child or immunize five. That's a tiny fraction of the cost of
solving these problems if they escalate over time.
The United States will target our support toward three areas that the Haitian government has requested, which are
aimed at promoting conditions that are essential for national and regional progress.
First, the Haitian people need to be secure. They must be able to travel safely to work and school and participate in the
civic lives of their communities without fear of violence.
Second, the country needs stronger infrastructure, particularly roads, which are the circulatory system of any robust
economy. Meanwhile, the people of Haiti are ready to work, but jobs are in short supply. We can accomplish two things
at once by putting people to work building roads and other infrastructure throughout Haiti.
And third, last year's hurricanes blew a hole in the government's budget.
Now Haiti is facing a huge deficit, which will make it harder to provide services in the short-term or fund major projects
in the long-term. Their debt obligations further constrain their ability to lay the groundwork for the future.
On each of these issues-security, jobs and infrastructure, and debt relief-the United States is lending its assistance and
seeking to partner with other nations to maximize our collective impact.
First, security. Effective international partnerships have already helped stem violence and improve security in Haiti. Cite
Soleil, for example, was a no-man's-land for years, but today, violence has subsided and a new sense of freedom is felt in
the streets.
The Haitian National Police have been supported in their work by the UN peacekeeping operation in Haiti, which is the
first in the hemisphere in which Latin American and Caribbean nations have participated. Brazil has led the mission with
determination and skill. This level of engagement and collaboration is a major step forward for our region.
But criminal networks operating in Haiti have not been eliminated. Haiti continues to fight drug traffickers who have
made this country a distribution point for illegal drugs headed to the United States, Canada and Europe.
Drug trafficking is a problem that involves many nations, all of which have a role to play in ending this deadly trade. That
includes the United States. We will give $2 million to fight drug trafficking in Haiti through the Merida Initiative, a plan
conceived by Mexico, Central America and the United States. This money will fund a secure communications network
for the Haitian police; provide a maritime base, vehicles and operational support for police drug units; provide training
to promote cross-border cooperation between Haiti and the Dominican Republic; and sharpen the investigation and
prosecution of drug crimes.
Once security is established, opportunity can take root. Nations from Canada to Spain to Japan offered generous
assistance to help repair the damage from last year's storms. Now it is time to take the next step-to move beyond
peacekeeping and disaster relief to long-term reconstruction and development.
Haiti has the highest unemployment rate in the hemisphere; 70 percent of its people don't have jobs. It also has one of
the region's highest population growth rates. Together, these trends have created what one development expert has
called a ""youth tsunami""-nearly 1 million youths are expected to come into the job market in the next five years.
To spur the creation of jobs, the United States passed the HOPE Act in 2006, to give garments made in Haiti tariff-free
access to the U.S. market. Last October, we extended this trade preference for another decade. Apparel is one of the
largest sectors in Haiti's economy. We see great potential for job creation in this field, and we are gratified by Brazil's
interest in supporting the Haitian apparel industry as well.
But to build a diversified economy, Haiti needs more than trade deals. It also needs the infrastructure to support the
flow of goods and services. The roads in Haiti are beyond inadequate; many communities are isolated by the lack of a
passable road, which prevents people from holding jobs, children from going to school, and farmers from bringing their
crops to market.
Better roads could facilitate greater trade and bring more Haitians into the global economy.
Haiti also needs better roads in tourist areas, to promote that sector of the economy. Other urgent infrastructure needs
include digging water catchments to prevent floods, completing a garment workers' training center, and creating canals
to help irrigation.
As part of the $287 million in non-emergency assistance we will provide to Haiti this year, we have authorized $20
million in aid to generate jobs, to help people put their skills to work building their country's future. We look forward to
working with Haiti to distribute that money quickly and effectively, to trigger a virtuous circle for long-term economic
growth.
All the fiscal responsibility in the world can't prevent a natural disaster.
The hurricanes didn't just wash away crops and houses; they also washed away
months of government planning for the future. Haiti is facing an
approximately $50 million budget deficit, which could undermine Haiti's long-term ambitions as well as services that
people depend on to survive.
The United States will provide $20 million to pay Haiti's upcoming debt service obligations, to free Haiti to use its
resources to fill that budget gap.
[There is a fourth urgent need that the United States is committed to helping Haiti resolve. The combined effect of
rising food prices globally and the destruction of crops by the hurricanes have exposed millions of Haitians to
malnutrition and its destructive effects on health and productivity. Malnourished people are often too weak to work;
chronically hungry children struggle to learn in school. Food insecurity is not only a source of suffering, but a direct
threat to economic growth and global stability. The United States will provide a $15-million in-kind contribution of food
to help Haiti as it continues to rebuild. ]
These are some of the ways in which the United States is ready to partner with Haiti and other nations. But there are
additional pieces of the larger mission that need support-from helping Haiti adapt to climate change so future
hurricanes won't claim thousands of lives; to strengthening health systems; promoting sustainable agriculture; and
developing civil society.
This work is not only a matter for governments, but also a mission for our people. Here in the U.S., I have heard from
many individuals and groups who care about Haiti and want to help it develop but don't know how to invest their time
and money in a way that will make a real impact. We should think creatively about helping people outside government
get involved in a meaningful way with Haiti's future. Our people are our most valuable resource, and their potential to
help in places like Haiti has not yet been tapped.
We know from empirical data that small investments go a long way. This is something I've seen for myself in my own
visits to Haiti. I traveled there with my husband shortly after our wedding, and again years later as First Lady. I met a
doctor who had emigrated to the United States and became a U.S. Air Force Colonel, but returned to his home town of
Pignon to run a center for health, women's literacy and microcredit. He and his staff had few resources, but they
offered a comprehensive range of services to thousands of clients.
I visited a family-planning clinic where young people were trained to educate their peers about how to protect their
health and prevent teen pregnancy.
And I met with women from a group called Women in Democracy. These women had attended a global conference on
women's leadership in Montevideo, Uruguay, and when they returned home, they created this organization to support
Haitian women running for office.
Eleven years later, their organization is larger and stronger than ever, and so is their mission. In addition to supporting
women candidates, they also hold trade fairs for women entrepreneurs, run civic education programs to teach women
their rights, support women journalists, and build connections between women throughout the Caribbean.
These Haitian women remind us that we will never achieve real progress if we leave millions of people behind. And they
demonstrate a powerful commitment on the part of the Haitian people to participate in and lead their nation's recovery.
Our role is to support their work however we can, and to demonstrate through our actions our belief that their future is
as important as our own.
What happens next in Haiti will send a message to the world about the power of collaboration on behalf of every poor
nation that has worked hard to earn a foothold in the global economy but has tumbled in recent months.
On behalf of every man and woman in the hemisphere, from the northern expanses of Canada to the southern tip of
Argentina, who is working harder than ever with fewer resources and for smaller rewards. and the children whose
futures have been jeopardized by forces far beyond their control. let us prove our commitment to an economic recovery
that reaches not only the citizens of our individual nations but all people everywhere.","['Haiti', 'HAITI', 'Washington', 'D.C.', 'Haiti', 'Caribbean', 'Sea', 'Western', 'Hemisphere', 'Europe', 'Middle', 'East', 'Asia', 'Haiti', 'Haiti', 'Caribbean', 'Americas', 'Portland', 'Port-au-Prince', 'United', 'States', 'Haiti', 'Haiti', 'U.S.', 'United', 'States', 'New', 'York', 'Haiti', 'Haiti', 'Haiti', 'Haiti', 'Haiti', 'Haiti', 'Haiti', 'United', 'States', 'Haiti', 'Brazil', 'Haiti', 'Haiti', 'Haiti', 'Haiti', 'Haiti', 'Haiti', 'Haiti', 'United', 'States', 'Haiti', 'Haiti', 'Haiti', 'United', 'States', 'Haiti', 'Haiti', 'Caribbean', 'Brazil', 'Haiti', 'Haiti', 'United', 'States', 'Canada', 'Europe', 'United', 'States', 'Haiti', 'Mexico', 'Central', 'America', 'United', 'States', 'Haiti', 'Dominican', 'Republic', 'Canada', 'Spain', 'Japan', 'Haiti', 'United', 'States', 'Haiti', 'U.S.', 'Haiti', 'Haiti', 'Haiti', 'Haiti', 'Haiti', 'Haiti', 'Haiti', 'Haiti', 'United', 'States', 'Haiti', 'Haiti', 'United', 'States', 'Haiti', 'United', 'States', 'Haiti', 'United', 'States', 'Haiti', 'Haiti', 'U.S.', 'Haiti', 'Haiti', 'Haiti', 'Haiti', 'United', 'States', 'U.S.', 'Pignon', 'Montevideo', 'Uruguay', 'Caribbean', 'Haiti', 'Canada', 'Argentina']"

The teachers at Oak Hill Academy approach their jobs with the faith that even the most hardened juvenile
delinquents can achieve -- and the knowledge that many still won't
By Karen Houppert
Sunday, April 12, 2009; W18
The six teenage boys, incarcerated at the District's Oak Hill juvenile detention facility in Laurel file into their
classroom after lunch one late January afternoon. They are surprised to see strangers -- five women and two
men -- sitting in the chairs that the boys typically occupy.
The students find some empty seats and shrug out of their matching brown coats and mismatched scarves. They
are curious about the visitors in a lean-back, fold-your-arms, prove-it kind of way.
""I'm James Forman,"" begins a 40-something man. ""I'm a professor at Georgetown Law School and -- ""
""You related to the James Forman?"" interrupts 17-year-old Carleto Bailey.
""I'm James Forman Jr.""
""That your father? James Forman your dad?"" Carleto demands.
""Yes, I ""
""Wasn't he some big civil rights guy? NAACP? Or SNCC?""
""SNCC,"" Forman says, seemingly surprised that Carleto has heard of his father, who was executive secretary of
the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee for years in the 1960s before becoming active with the Black
Panthers.
B6
""He's a good guy,"" Carleto continues. ""You tell him that.""
Forman smiles. ""He passed a few years ago, but he would be happy to hear this,"" the professor says. He scans
the room. The Oak Hill students, all African American, are dressed identically in khaki pants and royal-blue
polo shirts. They have chosen seats on the edges of the room and, after sitting down, have pushed their chairs
back as far as possible against the wall.
Forman's Georgetown law students -- African American, Arab, Latino, Caucasian -- are in jeans and sweaters.
They lean forward, intent and maybe a little bit nervous. ""I teach a class on juvenile justice at the law school,""
Forman continues. ""And I thought this would be a really good way for law students to learn about juvenile
justice. There is a certain amount you can learn from reading, but you also need to see and experience things. So
I thought they would learn a lot from coming out here and hearing about your experiences.""
Carleto raises an eyebrow. This is a new one.
""And the benefit for you is that they know things about the law that you don't. Ya'll have certain things you
know. They have certain things they know. It can be a learning opportunity for everybody.""
Forman suggests they go around the room and share their names and an interesting fact about themselves.
Dead silence.
He smiles encouragingly. ""My name is James Forman, and I helped to start this organization, See Forever, that
now runs your school,"" he says.
Carleto, who has been leaning back on the two rear legs of his chair, brings it down with a bang that sends his
short dreads swinging forward and his black plastic rectangular glasses sliding down his nose.
A few Georgetown students jump.
He looks out over the top of his glasses. ""My name's Carleto Bailey,"" he says. ""My interesting fact is that I'm
funny./I
He gives a wide smile of bright white teeth. The Georgetown students laugh. Oak Hill student Ashawntea
Henderson, 17, who sits next to him, rolls his eyes. But Carleto's not done: ""And I'm smart.""
But as it turns out, these Georgetown folks -- like his other teachers at Oak Hill Academy -- aren't going to
accept Carleto's assertion at face value. They want more than good grades, more than the right answers on a
multiple-choice test. They want him to prove that he can think.
Forman shows the group an excerpt of a film about juveniles incarcerated at New York's Rikers Island.
Afterward, the law students want to know whether a label makes a difference. It's a hard question. ""Inmates?
Residents? Scholars?"" one of them asks. ""Does it matter what you're called?""
Carleto studies the woman's face to discern what she wants to hear back. It is blank. He struggles. ""Not so
much,"" he says, finally. He looks at her. She seems unconvinced. He worries that he has given the wrong
answer and tries again.
""Back in the community, there are certain [police] patrols in the neighborhood who say, 'I know what you're up
to.' When we come home, some of us are trying to do right, but they basically criticize us because you're already
labeled.""
""What are the labels?"" Forman asks.
This one is easy for Carleto. He sinks down in his chair and throws it out.
""Trouble,"" he says.
***
Carleto Bailey is trouble. He is also, as he rightly noted, smart. But he has arrived at Oak Hill Academy with a
few disadvantages: He has been poorly educated in the D.C. public schools, was frequently truant and has had
multiple run-ins with the law. The D.C. Department of Youth Rehabilitation Services, which runs Oak Hill,
won't release information on the specific crime that landed Carleto here because he is still a juvenile, but we do
know this is Carleto's second time at the detention center. His academic knowledge is spotty at best. He can tell
you who James Forman is, but not where the comma falls in a letter's greeting. (""Dear, Fidel"" he writes in a
mock letter to Castro during English class.) He is a fairly typical Oak Hill ""scholar.""
And, once upon a time, he would have been written off But today, staff at the fledgling Oak Hill Academy are
determined to view the kids' captive time here as a window of opportunity to fill in some of the gaping holes in
their education. Part of the reform initiative of Vincent Schiraldi, director of Youth Rehabilitation Services, the
school opened its doors only last year and takes a unique approach to teaching delinquent youth.
What would happen, Oak Hill Academy co-founders Forman and David Domenici wondered, if you seduced
these kids with content that was meaningful to them? What would happen if they had lots of good, caring
teachers in small classrooms? What if one assumed the kids could learn -- and behaved as such? In other words,
what would happen if the District's most challenged students got a private school education, albeit on a campus
of a decidedly different nature?
""The bottom line,"" says Domenici, ""is that the kids most at risk need the highest quality programming, but
they've gotten the worst.""
It is this conviction that drove Domenici, who is also the school's principal, and Forman to create three public
charter schools for underprivileged and troubled students in the District over the past 11 years. Called the Maya
Angelou schools, the two high schools and middle school attack educational deficiencies from all angles.
Students attend small classes taught by specially trained staff. The high school day stretches from 9 a.m. to 6
p.m., with three meals provided. Some kids, whose home lives prove too chaotic for study, are offered
supervised housing in the neighborhood. And it works. Last year, 93 percent of Maya Angelou graduates were
accepted into two- or four-year colleges, Domenici says. (According to the District's Office of the State
Superintendent of Education, 29 percent of students who enter ninth grade in D.C. public schools and city
charter schools enroll in postsecondary educational programs within 18 months of graduating high school.)
It is a good model. But even though Domenici and Forman were used to teaching court-involved youth -- about
40 percent of Maya Angelou students had spent some time at Oak Hill -- working inside the gates posed a new
set of challenges. Youth Rehabilitation Services has been under a court monitor for 23 years due in part to a
history of abuse and poor conditions. When Schiraldi took over the department in 2005 and began his reform
efforts by implementing a less punitive and more therapeutic detention model at Oak Hill, he saw immediately
that changing the school was essential. ""How could I look at my staff at Oak Hill and say we are about
excellence when the kids were sitting in a school that was a total waste of time from 9 to 3 every day?""
Schiraldi says. Kids sat and watched movies all day. Little, if any teaching was going on, Schiraldi says. ""It was
a miserable, miserable school.""
Schiraldi immediately began lobbying the D.C. Board of Education hard to hire someone new to operate the
school, and as soon as he got the okay, he put out a request for proposals. Domenici and Forman submitted a
plan that Schiraldi says ""blew the other ones out of the water,"" and in 2007 were awarded a $12 million contract
to run the school for the next three years.
Domenici's and Forman's partnership is a somewhat unlikely one. Domenici is the son of former New Mexico
Republican senator Pete Domenici. He went to Stanford Law School, worked in corporate law for a few years
and then gave it up to teach and work with teen delinquents. Forman is the grandson of Jessica Mitford, who
was the daughter of a British baron and a celebrated civil rights activist and journalist. Forman, who graduated
from Yale Law School, worked as a law clerk for Justice Sandra Day O'Connor and as a D.C. public defender.
After seeing how few good schooling options his teenage clients had, he joined forces with Domenici, whom he
met through a mutual friend, to start an independent school for 20 students in 1997. A year later, it became part
of the first Maya Angelou public charter school.
At Oak Hill Academy, principal Domenici fights with an occasionally maddening bureaucracy for basics:
functioning boilers, permission for a college tour for a group of six students, classes uninterrupted by
corrections staff who sometimes will call three-quarters of the students out in the middle of class to take their
meds. Forman is chairman of the Maya Angelou Public Charter School Board of Directors and board member
of its parent group, the See Forever Foundation. He attacks hurdles from the other side, fundraising and
advocating for juvenile justice reform.
""When David came out to run the school here, it was like ""Ocean's 12"": Go find all the people you can trust
from your previous mission,"" Forman jokes. That included past colleagues and even a few Maya Angelou
graduates. Samantha Crandal Simpore, who had been at a then-coed Oak Hill herself when she was 15 on an
accessory assault charge, went to a Maya Angelou school and now runs the Oak Hill Academy welcome center.
""I tell them, I was here, too,"" Simpore says. She tells each new student about how she was 17 years old and
didn't know her multiplication tables, how she rode the bus to school each day hooked up to her Walkman,
hoping no one knew she was listening to a recitation of times tables. ""I say: 'You're at an intersection in your
life. You know what's down the street behind you. Nothing you can do about that. But you have a choice about
what's up the road ahead.'""
Many of the 90 Oak Hill students, ranging in age from 14 to 19, come in performing way below grade level, and
nearly half have been diagnosed with learning disabilities. They are at Oak Hill for an average of 10 months,
cycling in and out on a schedule that has nothing to do with a nine-month academic year. Out of necessity, they
are grouped according to the cell blocks they live on to keep opposing gangs separate. Thirteen-year-olds can be
in classes with 18-year-olds. More than half have been committed to Oak Hill for violent felonies. Fights are
common. (Before the month is out, Carleto will get into a fistfight in the hallway that will delay his release
date.)
Through the use of small classes -- typically five to 14 teens work with one teacher, a teaching assistant and a
guard -- the school organizes the curriculum around four-week themes designed to pique students' curiosity and
get them to think critically about the nature of democracy, social justiCe and their role in the world. For
example, during the Relationship theme, students parse the types of relationships ranging from those between
humans and the natural world (ancient river civilizations) to those between individuals and groups (Pharaohs
and their subjects) to those between humans and ideas (liberation theology). At the same time, in English class,
students will be working on the standard five-paragraph essay via the guiding question: ""Why do relationships
matter, and how can relationships be both good and bad for people?"" With the current unit, Change, the D.C.
public school system's learning standards are woven into the social studies curriculum under loose headings
such as ""Changes in the Way Humans Think About the World and Their Place in It,"" which becomes a way of
introducing the scientific revolution, the Enlightenment and the Magna Carta. It's a philosophy that emphasizes
learning through making cross-discipline connections long popular in affluent, progressive schools but typically
eschewed in schools for underprivileged kids, where rote learning and a return to such basics often rule.
Oak Hill Academy has also created a course called Advocacy, which the Georgetown law students are co-
teaching, emphasizing this month's theme. Domenici believes learning how the law works in a democracy ""is
essential to teaching them to be good citizens.""
""We always believed that one of our roles should be to help kids self-advocate or advocate on behalf of a
community,"" Domenici says. ""We think this is a good skill for students individually and also one that our
democracy demands.""
But this is an ambitious agenda, and Oak Hill Academy faces significant obstacles. Can you teach teens to think
critically when they're missing the basic underpinnings of education? How do you teach empowerment in a
setting that demands rigid compliance to keep kids from misbehaving?
Although he sometimes grows discouraged, Domenici does his best to buoy his staff members when they learn
that one of their most promising students got into a fight on the unit or ""graduated"" from the program only to
commit another crime and be sent back. ""I talk to staff about the fact that, day to day, our job is to do the
absolute best work you can in the domain that is within your control,"" he says, reminding them that they don't
control all the pieces of the puzzle. ""And if you do that well, you have done the moral and just thing.""
His staff members must keep the faith while straddling what are to them two equally potent realities: First,
knowledge is power, and through possessing it, every student is capable of success. And, absent the right
support, failure lurks right around the corner. It sounds like this: ""I think Carleto has a good chance of finishing
high school and going on to college,"" Domenici says. Pause. ""Also, he is highly at risk of not doing that.""
***
It is a cold day in late January, and Oak Hill is in the midst of the four-week session on change. Dressed in
jeans, a blue shirt and a gray corduroy jacket (the heat's not working), Oak Hill social studies teacher John
Adams paces around the room and then stops to bend over Carleto, who is doodling on a piece of paper at his
desk.
""Pay attention,"" he says, taking Carleto's pencil. ""Carleto, what is today's essential question?""
""What is historical change, and how is it different from other kinds of change?"" Carleto says, reading from the
board where Adams has scrawled his topic.
""Yes,"" Adams says. He ignores a student who is wandering around the room aimlessly, until the student
snatches a hat off a classmate and tosses it toward the hallway. A youth development specialist, which is how
corrections guards are referred to under Schiraldi, appears to be deeply engrossed in a magazine in the back of
the room. But she snatches the hat from mid-air, scowls at the disruptive student and tucks the hat in her pocket.
""Please sit,"" Adams tells the student.
Not quite sitting, not quite standing, the student perches on the edge of Adams's desk.
Good enough.
Adams continues: ""What's the difference between personal change and historical change?""
Silence.
""Anybody?
More silence.
""Ashawntea?""
""Historical change is like a revolution,"" Ashawntea says.
Adams throws out a list of changes -- getting a raise in salary, moving to a new house, the election of President
Obama -- and Carleto accurately sorts the changes into micro and macro, personal and historical.
""Obama's campaign was all about change,"" Adams says. ""Do you think he is talking historical change?"" He
wants the students to think about the president, who has been in office now for two days. What might his first
100 days look like? he asks the students. ""What advice would you offer him?""
Carleto looks stumped.
""Just throw out some ideas,"" Adams prompts. He tells the students that they are going to craft their own letters
to the president, advising him on how to set his agenda for change.
Carleto slaps his pencil down on the desk. ""Obama's not reading our letters,"" he says. He folds his arms across
his chest, skeptical that the president will lay eyes on this letter -- and skeptical, perhaps, that the teachers really
want to hear his ideas.
***
Later, Carleto will acknowledge that he knows quite a bit about the president, as he is reading Barack Obama's
""Dreams From My Father."" ""It started off as a good book, but it got excellent,"" he says. He struggles hard to
articulate the book's themes and appeal. ""I don't know how to put it,"" he says finally, ""but growing up with -- no
disrespect, but -- a Caucasian mom and an African father, he still made it through.""
Sitting in a guard's room off the gym on a February evening, the echoing sound of classmates bouncing
basketballs around the cavernous gym, Carleto goes on to tell his own possibly apocryphal story.
""As a child, he was very fun, happy -- as far as kindergarten through sixth grade. Starting in first grade, he was
on the honor roll and was also making it to school every day,"" he says, beginning in third person, but quickly
lapsing into first. ""In the late stages of middle school; at the end of eighth grade, I started smoking weed, doing
stuff I wasn't supposed to be doing.""
He takes full responsibility. ""No one peer-pressured me or anything. I was liking what was going on when I was
high,"" he explains. He, like almost all the teens at Oak Hill, denies being involved in a gang. Still, Carleto says
that his best friend since elementary school was killed in 10th grade in ""a neighborhood thing."" ""Nowadays,
anyone can just ride up on you, and you can be mistaken for someone else and be shot,"" he says, explaining that
his buddy was shot because of a ""miscommunication."" ""It wasn't intended for us,"" he says, insisting that he and
his friend, nicknamed ""Smoke,"" were just waiting for the bus. Then he announces, ""I don't want to talk about
it.""
So he doesn't, though it clearly haunts him: He will doodle ""R.I.P. Smoke"" on the cover of his blue folder or on
a piece of loose-leaf paper or the comer of the chalkboard.
He's happy to talk about Oak Hill Academy though, where he has a 3.5 grade-point average after six months.
(Domenici says Carleto is in the top 25 percent of students at Oak Hill and tests fairly high on assessments.)
Carleto likes the school even though it is a bit easy for him, being a senior in with freshman. He complains that
the classes are too short and that the guards are always interrupting them to move on just when the class is
getting warmed up. That really bugs him, but he doesn't say much. He says that he will be leaving Oak Hill in
two months and intends to finish his schooling at Oak Hill's transition center in the District, from which he says
he will graduate this June. When he gets out, there are a couple of things he wants to do right off, he says. First,
he intends to see his girlfriend, then go out to a restaurant and then go to ""the Adidas shop in Georgetown,
where my mom will get me some stuff-- and my dad, too.""
He says his mom was pretty upset when he got arrested and sent to Oak Hill. ""She was. . . I'm going to say she
was kind of like surprised at my actions, what I done,"" Carleto says. ""You know how they say 'Whatever hides
in the dark, comes out?'. . . She was not ashamed of me, but disappointed in me."" Meanwhile, she makes the
long, 45-minute trek from the District to Laurel to visit. ""Every weekend, both days!"" he says.
He is alternately vague and specific when he describes his family life. He has four brothers -- ages 27, 23, 16
and 11 -- and reports that he and his two younger brothers live with his mom. He says his mom works as a
secretary, but he struggles to remember where. ""She was working with, what's that program downtown by the
Washington Monument, dealing with Smokey the Bear?. . . I'm trying to think. It's right by the Holocaust
Museum. It's a brick building. She works there.""
Later, Carleto's school case worker, Essence Jones, will offer a somewhat different account of Carleto's life.
Although Carleto is in 12th grade, he will not graduate in June as he says. He is still six credits shy, Jones says.
And it will be at least three months -- not two -- before his release.
Carleto's father is not part of his life, Jones says. The teenager had been living with his aunt before coming to
Oak Hill. His mother, who has a rap sheet dating to 1982, has been in and out of jail for years, arrested
repeatedly for a string of felonies and misdemeanors, including possession and distribution of drugs, as well as
prostitution. She has been in prison since 2005, serving three consecutive sentences totaling seven years for
assault with a dangerous weapon, attempted distribution of cocaine and violation of bail.
She is not visiting Carleto on weekends.
***
By the end of February, still in the midst of the unit on change, the Oak Hill teens file into their advocacy class,
jostling each other, edgy. It is unseasonably warm outside, and they do not want to be here. Reluctantly they
take their seats, and Carleto positions himself so that he can see the patch of brown grass and mud in the prison
yard, visible through the door someone has wedged open. Occasionally, a breeze wafts into the room.
Today, the law students decide to tackle the topic of disproportionate minority confinement. If youths of color
are 35 percent of the general population in the United States, but 62 percent of the prison population, this is
disproportionate minority confinement, the law students explain. They refer the teens to a handout each has on
the desk in front of him, an article excerpt from New American Media, ""Racism of the Juvenile Justice System
Revealed,"" to explain that this isn't simply because people of color commit more crimes: ""African-American
youths are 4.5 times more likely, and Latinos 2.3 times more likely, than white youths to be detained for
identical offenses. About half of white teenagers arrested on a drug charge go home without being formally
charged and drawn into the system. Only one-quarter of black teens arrested on drug charges catch a similar
break.""
Although youth of color are 100 percent of Oak Hill's population of inmates and, indeed, 100 percent of all 721
juvenile delinquents currently committed to Youth Rehabilitation Services care in settings across the city,
disproportionate minority confinement is a hard concept for the teens to grasp. Georgetown student Abby Fee
tries a pie graph, a bar graph, a sketch of disproportionate Xs and Os. Blank stares.
Then it slowly dawns on Ashawntea what they're talking about. ""Hey,"" he says, suddenly sitting forward.
""They're switched around! Basically, there's more of us juveniles in prison than white juveniles -- even though
there's more of them.""
""Yes,"" Fee says. ""So the population outside the system looks a lot different from that inside the system.""
Ashavvntea sits back in his chair to mull this over.
Fee and the other law students move the teens from the statistics to a speculative discussion about the reasons
behind these figures. They have prepared a role-playing game to coax the teens into thinking about this from
different perspectives. Then, they want the students to practice advocating for change. ""So, we're going to have
three roles,"" Fee says, dividing the teens into pairs. ""One group is a 15-year-old; one group is playing a math
teacher; and one group is playing a city council member.""
Carleto and his partner learn that they are to play a city council member who is preparing a presentation on
reforming the police department. Carleto doesn't want to be a city council member. He doesn't even want to be
here today. He wraps and unwraps his pencil in the bottom of his T-shirt. He puts his glasses on, then takes
them off.
""How could you maintain better relationships"" with police? Fee asks, settling herself into a chair to help Carleto
and his partner work through this.
Carleto throws his pencil down on the table. Won't answer. She asks again. Silence. Finally, he offers a sullen
challenge. ""Stop harassing people for no reason?""
""How do you want them to treat people?""
""Equally,"" he says. He picks up the pencil and tap, tat, taps it on the desk. Fee tries to get him to be more
specific.
""Don't arrest for small problems. Instead, take them home, and tell your family what you're doing,"" Carleto's
partner says, unconsciously slipping into second person.
""And how do you think they can help crime be stopped or decreased in general?"" Fee prods.
A long pause. Could be their minds are whirring busily; could be they're spacing out. Fee, a teacher before
enrolling at Georgetown, takes it in stride. She taps the paper a couple of times and repeats the question.
""Don't have 10 or 15 cars patrolling and then have an area where you barely see a police car,"" Carleto says.
""Patrol each ward equally?"" asks Fee.
Carleto writes that down, then adds: ""I see a lot of cruel things they done that ain't right."" Fee nods, encourages
him to write it down.
Carleto's partner grabs the pencil and speaks as he writes. ""The majority of police shouldn't carry guns. I could
say, 'The majority of police are racist.'""
""But how would you fix that?"" Fee. prods.
""A camera on their car to catch them if they're doing it -- but a secret one,"" Carleto suggests. He sits up
straighter in his chair. ""And don't just pull over people because they're black. They can say anything, that's the
reason why I pulled you over, because your headlights are off or whatever."" Suddenly, Carleto is on a roll, and
he rattles off a list of improvements.
""Call to order of the city council,"" says Georgetown student Dania Ayoubi.
Carleto and his partner stand in the front of the class. ""Hello, I'm Mr. Jones, and I am a city councilman,""
Carleto says, glancing down at his paper and twisting the tail of his shirt with his free hand. ""We have some
complaints from the different communities and wards about police, and these are some of our suggestions about
cracking down on officers."" He sounds nervous as he begins the list. ""Stop harassing minorities and other ethnic
youths, and treat them equal to the same race that you are. Also, police don't arrest if there is a situation at the
school like a fight or anything. I feel they should not be arrested but taken home. Then tell their parents why
this happened and what the reason was for being stopped by the police."" He moves briskly through the
suggestions and twice, tentatively, tries actually making eye contact with the audience. In conclusion, he says,
""verbally abusing"" youth won't be tolerated any more. ""Basically, we want to crack down on the officers and
have them removed, if so.""
Another pair of students rises to begin a presentation, but the teens are interrupted by the crackle of a guard's
walkie-talkie. ""Time to go!"" the guard announces.
The law students are surprised -- they are not quite done -- but politely acquiesce.
""Wait!"" Ashawntea says, standing up. ""We got 10 more minutes.""
""It will take you five minutes to get your stuff together and get your coats on,"" the guard says.
""But we have 10 minutes!"" Carleto insists. He and Ashawntea sit back down and fold their arms. ""It's only 2:20.
We got 10 more minutes still.""
The guard takes a beat, then shrugs and concedes Carleto's point. He goes back out into the hall to wait.
Carleto shoots Ashawntea a look of surprise. His advocacy worked.
""Yesss!"" Ashawntea hisses under his breath.

I am a Professional Member of the American Society for Industrial Security, and
the American College of Forensic Examiners; I have guest lectured and taught
industrial security management, homeland security, port and harbor security and
critical incident response management.
As elated as everyone is over the splendid outcome of the Maersk Alabama
hijacking case, as I had predicted, in today's news, it is reported that four
additional vessels were attacked and now Terrorists are holding some 60 hostages.
Before anyone, does anything regarding Somalia, may I make the following
comments and observations.
What is going on in the Gulf of Aden is as an organized criminal enterprise for
profit. There are some 250 hostages being held and they are being kept as well as
they can be under the circumstances because the terrorists are expecting a payday
out of this. As soon as they see any form of direct Military action in the northeast
at the mouth of the Gulf of Aden, I can assure you more Americans will be
abducted, and we will see another series of video beheadings under a Democratic
watch.
I would recommend that the Secretary encourage the United Nations to create an
International Maritime Security Working Group. Since the Shipping Industry has
already absorbed something like Fifty Billion Dollars regarding the various piracy
incidents in 2008 alone; they have the resources to contract private
security/military contractors who could work onboard merchant shipping in
International Waters.

Thank you in advance for your anticipated interest, and cooperation in this matter.

I'm faxing you a draft of the speech. It is way too long and something of a hybrid, having started out as a big
policy speech in advance of the summit. Now it is a town hall one day before the POTUS outlines his agenda at
the intervention. My suggestion is that you review this long draft, which covers a lot of ground (though not
everything). In the meantime, I'll work on an abbreviated version that focuses on your main themes -- the
urgency of our working together with other countries to narrow the income gap and reduce poverty by creating
a safety net of education, food security, and public safety that unleashes the full potential of the people and
nations of our Hemisphere.",[]

KABUL (Reuters) — One of the top candidates expected to bid to unseat Afghan President Karzai withdrew abruptly from
the election race, dealing a blow to opposition hopes of fielding a contender with a broad enough base to win.
Gul Agha Sherzai, popular governor of Nangarhar Province and a former anti-Soviet guerrilla commander, had been in
talks to head up a broad opposition ticket with two vice presidential candidates that would span ethnic lines.

Clinton, in Iraq, Blames 'Rejectionists' for Violence By MARK LANDLER BAGHDAD — Secretary of State Hillary Rodham
Clinton arrived here Saturday morning for a one-day visit, delivering an American show of support for Iraq as it battles a
sudden eruption of violence, in the wake of suicide bombings that killed at least 140 people and wounded several
hundred more on Thursday and Friday.
Mrs. Clinton, in her first visit to Baghdad as secretary of state, acknowledged that the attacks were worrisome. She said
she would seek a briefing on the security situation from the American military commander, Gen. Ray Odierno, in her first
meeting on Saturday, a day packed with appointments.
But she played down suggestions that the attacks augured a return to the relentless sectarian violence that convulsed
Iraq in 2006. She said they did not signal that a new jihadist movement was taking root in Iraq, which could derail the
progress the country has made in the last two years.
""In Iraq, there will always be political conflicts,"" Mrs. Clinton said to reporters before setting off on the unannounced
visit Friday evening. ""But I really believe that Iraq, as a whole, is on the right track.""
She characterized the latest bout of violence as the last gasp of ""rejectionists"" who fear that the government will
succeed in creating a united and peaceful Iraq. The suicide bombings, she said, are ""in an unfortunately tragic way, a
signal that the rejectionists fear that Iraq is going in the right direction.""
""Are there going to be bad days? Yes, there are,"" Mrs. Clinton said. But she added, ""If you look at the evidence,
overwhelmingly the progress that's been made has been positive.""
The Obama administration, she said, was determined to help Iraq achieve ""stability, sovereignty, and self-reliance,"" as
the United States prepares to pull out the last of its troops by the end of 2011.
Mrs. Clinton has been a regular visitor here, coming three times as a senator to chart the progress of a war she voted to
authorize, but later said had been mismanaged by the Bush administration. She said she was pleased to be back, though
the attacks have cast a shadow over her visit.
While the violence is far below the worst levels in 2006, 18 major attacks this month have kindled fears that Baathist and
jihadist elements could be reconstituting themselves into a smaller, but still deadly, insurgency that will exploit the
withdrawal of American troops between now and 2011.
Mrs. Clinton compared these latest suicide bombings to a spectacular terrorist attack that occurred several months after
the Good Friday peace accord ended years of conflict in Northern Ireland.
At times, her analysis almost echoed that of former Vice President Dick Cheney and former Defense Secretary Donald
Rumsfeld. When the sectarian violence was relentless several years ago, Mr. Cheney spoke of the insurgency being in its
""last throes,"" while Mr. Rumsfeld talked of ""dead-enders"" who kept fighting a lost cause.
On Friday, Gen. David Petraeus, the head of the military's Central Command, testified before a House appropriations
committee that the suicide bombers may have been part of a militant network based in Tunisia. Four of the bombers, he
said, were from Tunisia.
Mrs. Clinton said she did not have specific information on the bombers, but said: ""We've seen suicide bombers from
many countries in Iraq over the last six years. It's unfortunate that young men, and occasionally even a young woman,
would travel to Iraq to kill other people in that way.""
41
The violence did not seem to curtail Mrs. Clinton's ambitions for her brief visit. In addition to General Odierno, she was
scheduled to meet a retinue of Iraqi leaders, including the president, Jalal Talabani; the prime minister, Nuni Kamal al-
Maliki; and the foreign minister, Hoshyar Zebari.
She is also playing host at a roundtable of Iraqi women, something she has done in previous trips to Iraq. And she is to
hold a town-hall meeting with Iraqi students, as well as members of nongovernmental organizations and provincial
reconstruction teams.
This is a format Mrs. Clinton savored as a presidential candidate, and that, as secretary of state, she has used from South
Korea to Turkey. ""I want to listen,"" she said, ""I want to respond to their questions and concerns. I want some feedback
and ideas of about how are we going to make this transition as successful as possible.""
When President Obama visited Baghdad earlier this month, dusty skies prevented him from traveling by helicopter from
Baghdad International Airport into the city. He met with Mr. Maliki at a palace near the airport and General Odierno at
the American base, Camp Victory.
The new American ambassador, Christopher R. Hill, beat Mrs. Clinton to Baghdad by one day. He was confirmed by the
Senate on Tuesday after a lengthy process that was held up by Republican senators, who objected to his lack of
experience in the Arab world and his handling of negotiations with North Korea over its nuclear weapons program.
In Iraq, Mr. Hill will spearhead the shift in emphasis by the United States from military to civilian operations. Some Iraq
experts said the American civilian presence here had been lacking momentum since the departure in February of the last
United States ambassador, Ryan C. Crocker.","['Iraq', 'Iraq', 'Baghdad', 'Iraq', 'Iraq', 'Iraq', 'Iraq', 'Iraq', 'Iraq', 'Iraq', 'United', 'States', 'Northern', 'Ireland', 'Tunisia', 'Tunisia', 'Iraq', 'Iraq', 'Iraq', 'South', 'Korea', 'Turkey', 'Baghdad', 'Baghdad', 'International', 'Airport', 'Baghdad', 'North', 'Korea', 'Iraq', 'United', 'States', 'Iraq', 'United', 'States']"

BAGHDAD (AP) - U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton says this week's deadly suicide bombings in Iraq are a
sign that extremists fear the Iraqi government is succeeding.
On her first visit to Iraq as America's top diplomat, Clinton said the country has made tremendous strides despite the
recent violence and continues to deserve support as the Obama administration moves to reduce the U.S. military
presence there.
Clinton arrived in Baghdad Saturday on an unannounced trip after suicide bombings in the capital and outside killed
at least 148 people on Thursday and Friday. The attacks have exposed gaps in security as Iraq takes over from U.S. forces
in protecting the country.","['Iraq', 'BAGHDAD', 'U.S.', 'Iraq', 'Iraq', 'America', 'U.S.', 'Baghdad', 'Iraq', 'U.S.']"

US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Monday urged women students to use the Internet to campaign for the release
of two American women journalists held in North Korea. Clinton urged graduates of Barnard College, a women's
university in New York City, to show their opposition to Pyongyang's detention of the two journalists who are due to go
on trial on June 4.
""We have two young women journalists right now imprisoned in North Korea and you can get busy on the Internet and
let the North Koreans know that we find that absolutely unacceptable,"" Clinton told the graduation ceremony.
Clinton was highlighting the new media tools that women can use to fight injustice around the world.
North Korea announced last Thursday that it had set a June 4 trial date for the two journalists — Euna Lee, a Korean-
American, and Laura Ling, a Chinese-American — but gave no details of the charges against them.
Clinton said afterward that the announcement of a trial date is ""a signal that there can be"" a resolution of the case soon,
even though she said the pair should be released immediately and the charges against them are ""baseless.""
The North has previously said they would go on trial for ""hostile acts"" and illegally entering the country. Their trial would
be held ""on the basis of the confirmed crimes committed by them,"" it has announced.
While working on a story about refugees fleeing the hardline communist North, the pair were detained March 17 along

Politico:
Health care could soon go the way of the automobile, with users having no choice but to buy
insurance coverage.
Within four years, every American could be required to own health insurance or pay their way
through tax penalties. The odds of such a sea change rose last week when chief Democratic and
Republican Senate negotiators on a health care bill acknowledged that many on the Finance
Committee considered the so-called individual mandate essential to lower insurance costs for
those who already have coverage.
President Barack Obama didn't embrace the individual mandate during the campaign, which
means he would essentially start from scratch in terms of selling the idea to voters.
The mandate was a central policy difference with Hillary Clinton, who argued that a mandate
was the only way to achieve universal coverage. Obama disagreed, saying enough people would
purchase insurance voluntarily if the costs could be brought down.
Progressive policy experts widely agreed that Obama's plan would have left out about 15 million
people. Clinton, with an assist from New York Times columnist Paul Krugman, regularly
assailed Obama for his no-mandate position.
Actually, I don't care who gets credit, as long as we actually get universal health care.",[]

1623,"Some other thoughtsAMS did not like any of this both for the substance and because she did not write it so we did not share it with you
today. Then I decided to share it with you anyway for any value it has for you.
Frame:
The world we live in today is inextricably interconnected. Together we succeed. Apart we fail. In the Obama
Administration, we will use smart power to advance to our shared security, shared prosperity and shared humanity.
In advancing our shared security, we seek to:
• Reduce threat of violent extremism
• Reduce the spread of weapons of mass destruction
In advancing our shared prosperity, we seek to:
• Use development to create and sustain strong stable economies by:
o Focusing on women as essential for driving economic growth;
o Expanding access to food and the means to grow or buy it; and,
o Expanding access to quality education in developing countries;
• Expand access to stable, affordable and increasingly clean energy sources
In advancing our shared humanity, we seek to:
• Expand human rights and the conditions that promote respect for human rights
• Support the development of health systems that support healthier societies and
confront the spread of pandemic disease (e.g., AlDs)
How we achieve these goals:
We will advance these goals through shared responsibility and the application of smart power. America has the
responsibility to lead, but can only lead in partnership with others. Smart power means elevating and
integrating diplomacy and development.
DIPLOMACY:
Focus on priority partnerships:
• Revitalized partnerships with historic allies EU, Japan, Korea, Australia;
• Calibrated partnerships with China and Russia;
31
• Cultivated partnerships: Brazil, India, Turkey, Indonesia, and South Africa;
• Targeted public/private and multilateral partnerships based upon the principles of
variable geometry (Le., focused on the problem at hand).
Build strong partnerships by:
• listening and mutual respect — which has begun already and will continue
• being accountable for the challenges we create and demanding that our partners are
similarly accountable;
• focusing on government to people, and people to people connections using new
technology to create buy in from bottom up so shared responsibility is experienced
on the ground and sustainable;
• eliminating the obstacles to cooperation that stand in the way of us achieve our
goals (e.g., resolving Cyprus so Turkey can enter the EU; engaging Iran to create
greater accountability among EU partners if engagement fails)
• creating work plans to drive cooperation on our shared agenda: tasks, timetables
and benchmarks for each country
DEVELOPMENT:
Establish and implement against our critical priorities:
• Women as economic drivers and social stabilizers;
• Education as the gateway to economic opportunity and human rights;
• Food and agriculture as the cornerstone of sustainable local economies
• Global health as the foundation for the future
Reform our government institutions
• Improve coordination in planning and budgeting across our diplomacy and
development
• Make Ambassadors country-level CEOs responsible for government-wide
efforts in each country.
o Grow the quality, talents and capacities of our development institutions;
o Introduce effective metrics and evaluation for accountability
Improve delivery and outcomes
32
• Assess and promote what works and stop spending resources on what doesn't.
• Establish transparent benchmarks for measuring success

defeat in the European elections on June 4. (New poll in Guardian shows widespread disaffection
with all parties as a result of the Commons expenses scandal; 27 percent voting for fringe parties.)
Gordon will attempt to overwhelm news coverage of the loss with a cabinet reshuffle, as early as the
next day, June 5. The plot (sounds like the Tudors): David is the target, from multiple angles and
motives, personal ambition mixed with anti-Blairism. Peter has always wanted to be Foreign
Secretary, a job held by his grandfather, Herbert Morrison. (Morrison was also deputy PM, why
doesn't Peter want that?) New Labour people regard Peter as more ambitious than New Labour at
this point. He supported Gordon's utterly misbegotten and wildly unpopular proposal to raise the top
tax rate to 50 percent. The fallout is less resentment of the affluent to paying more or grudging
understanding of need for new revenues as it is a sense that Labour under Gordon is abandoning the
project for social aspiration and opportunity that is at the heart of the New Labour message. Ed Balls,
one of Gordon's closest longtime advisers, is also determined to topple David. Balls is a
contemporary of David's, wants to be leader of the party himself, and continues the Gordon v. Tony
bitter rivalry into the future. Balls is currently Minister for Children and Schools and was linked to
Damian McBride (Gordon's hatchetman, who has trashed Blairites, got caught out on his blogging
scheme to smear Cameron). If Gordon names Peter to David's job, Balls would take Peter's and
become Business Secretary. David would be pushed into Home Secretary. Once Balls takes Peter's
job, Balls will likely reverse Peter's privatization proposal for the Royal Mail to win support from party's
left-wing base, beginning of his campaign against David for post-Gordon leadership struggle. Tony
sees the situation as terminal. Hope to speak with him soon. He is trying to become President of
Europe if and when Lisbon treaty passes. Jonathan made an interesting and ironic comment about
Colin Powell, given Tony's deference to him, that Powell's flaw was being too deferential to Bush.
From bitter experience, Jonathan is wishing you well, be close to the president, and advance your
ideas, too. There's more for when we can talk. Sid

1687,"Barack Obama may support insurance mandate
By CARRIE BUDOFF BROWN I 6/3/09 3:42 PM EDT
Updated: 6/3/09 11:22 PM EDT
As a presidential candidate, Barack Obama scoffed at Hillary Rodham Clinton's proposal to require people to
buy health insurance.
""(If) they can't afford it, they just don't get it,"" Obama said during the primary, arguing that a mandate would
not work unless insurance costs were lowered first.
For the first time, Obama confirmed Wednesday that he plans to stake out a different position as president.
In a letter to two leading Democratic senators, Obama said he could support a mandate on individuals to buy
coverage, as long as Congress exempted those who could not afford it. This marks a shift from his stance during
the campaign, when he tussled repeatedly with Clinton on the issue. She proposed an individual mandate, and
he did not.
""I share the goal of ending lapses and gaps in coverage that make us less healthy and drive up everyone's costs,
and I am open to your ideas on shared responsibility,"" Obama wrote. ""But I believe if we are going to make
people responsible for owning health insurance, we must make health care affordable.""
""If we do end up with a system where people are responsible for their own insurance, we need to provide a
hardship waiver to exempt Americans who cannot afford it,"" Obama wrote.
Detailing his positions on various health care proposals for the first time as president, Obama also said
Americans should be able to choose between public and private insurance plans in a reformed health care
system.
""I strongly believe that Americans should have the choice of a public health insurance option operating
alongside private plans,"" he wrote. ""This will give them a better range of choices, make the health care market
more competitive, and keep insurance companies honest.""
He offered qualified support for a mandate on employers to provide insurance or pay a fee to the government.
Employers ""have a responsibility to support health insurance for their employees,"" Obama wrote, but small
businesses should be exempt.
Obama's positions on these issues were not entirely surprising, but his decision to weigh in before
congressional Democratic leaders released a single bill was unexpected. Prior to the letter, Obama and his aides
had declined to say specifically where he stood on various issues, including the public plan and individual
mandate, saying they wanted Congress to lead the way in writing a bill.
But Democrats have been anxious for the president to take a more public stance, and the letter provides the
guidance that many in Congress had been craving as House and Senate committees move closer to releasing
draft bills.
""The president says get it done. Get it done right because we only get one chance,"" said Sen. Barbara Mikulski
(D-Md.), a member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. ""The letter essentially
synthesizes what the president is saying.""
He outlined the parameters in a letter to Senate Finance Chairman Max Baucus (D-Mont.) and Health,
Education, Labor and Pensions Committee Chairman Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.).
Obama's endorsement of a public insurance option could boost the controversial proposal and serve as catalyst
for the Democratic base as the president kicks off a grassroots campaign Saturday.
""It's clear that the Republican resistance to a public plan hasn't softened President Obama's support for one,""
Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in a statement. ""This strengthens the hand of those of us advocating for a
public option, which is the only way to keep the private insurers' feet to the fire.""
Despite almost uniform opposition from Republicans on the public plan, the president wrote in the letter that he
remains ""hopeful that many Republicans"" would back an overhaul bill.
Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), the ranking Republican on the Finance Committee, struck an optimistic tone in
a statement, saying the letter ""doesn't draw lines in the sand,"" and ""is helpful because of his statements that
reform legislation needs to have bipartisan support.""
However, the letter is likely to incite opponents, who have been frustrated by Obama's lack of specifics.
Indeed, on Thursday morning, Conservatives for Patients' Rights will begin airing a new TV ad called
""Bulldozer,"" which says a ""government-run plan"" will drive private insurers out of business and eliminate
consumer choices.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton will soon announce that gay American diplomats will be
given benefits similar to those that their heterosexual counterparts enjoy, U.S. officials said Saturday.
In a notice to be sent soon to State Department employees, Clinton says regulations that denied same-sex couples and
their families the same rights and privileges that straight diplomats enjoyed are ""unfair and must end,"" as they harm U.S.
diplomacy.
""Providing training, medical care and other benefits to domestic partners promote the cohesiveness, safety and
effectiveness of our posts abroad,"" she says in the message, a copy of which was obtained by The Associated Press.
""It will also help the department attract and retain personnel in a competitive environment where domestic partner
benefits and allowances are increasingly the norm for world-class employers,"" she says.
""At bottom, the department will provide these benefits for both opposite-sex and same-sex domestic partners because
it is the right thing to do,"" Clinton says.
Among the benefits that will now be granted gay diplomats: the right of domestic partners to hold diplomatic passports,
government-paid travel for their partners and families to and from foreign posts, and the use of U.S. medical facilities
abroad.
In addition, gay diplomats' families will now be eligible for U.S. government emergency evacuations and training courses
at the Foreign Service Institute, the message says.
The announcement, expected this week, was provided to the AP by a State Department official who is a member of the
Gays and Lesbians in Foreign Affairs Agencies organization. Two department officials not affiliated with the organization
confirmed its accuracy.
The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publically about the changes.","['WASHINGTON', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'U.S.']"

War Supplemental Conference Slips to Next Week
By Josh Rogin, CQ Staff
House leadership has decided not to hold a conference or a vote on the war supplemental spending bill this
week, as leaders worked behind the scenes to secure enough Democratic votes to pass the measure absent GOP
support.
Multiple lawmakers and aides confirmed the expected Thursday session to finalize negotiations over the bill
(HR 2346), which is mainly to fund the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, will not occur until at least early next
week. Democratic leaders were trying to convince as many as 18 of the 51 Democrats who voted against the
House version in May to change their votes, but many said they would not do so.
Republicans are promising to vote against the conference report en mass if it includes $5 billion worth of
funding related to the International Monetary Fund. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said Thursday it
would.
""I believe there are people in the Republican Party who support [the IMF funding]; they just don't want to
support it on this bill,"" Pelosi said Thursday, ""So we have to do that with all Democratic votes.""
She also pushed back against two key pillars of the House Republican leadership's argument against the IMF
funding, which is meant to accommodate an increased U.S. credit extension to the organization.
Responding to statements of Minority Leader John A. Boehner of Ohio that the IMF money is unrelated to the
war spending measure, Pelosi said the IMF help was a ""national security initiative"" because it helps to alleviate
sources of instability, such as poverty.
Pelosi also accused House Minority Whip Eric Cantor, R-Va., of fear mongering by putting out a statement
warning that IMF assistance could somehow fund terrorism.
""I don't know why anyone would say that the money is going to the hands of terrorists,"" she said. ""It simply is
not based in fact and is a scare tactic, and most unfortunate.""
House Democratic aides said the conference on the supplemental bill probably would be early next week.
""We're going to come up with a supplemental conference report in the next few days,"" said Senate Majority
leader Harry Reid, D-Nev.
6
Whipping Votes
House leaders had planned to hold the conference session Thursday and had said the House floor vote could be
as early as Friday. But their effort to convince members to switch their no votes was still underway Thursday
afternoon. •
Although several high ranking Democrats have pledged to switch their no votes, including Reps. Barney Frank,
D-Mass., and George Miller, D-Calif., many others have said they would not.
""It's a conscience vote,"" said Rep. Alan Grayson, D-Fla., who said he was inclined to not change his stance on
the bill
""I haven't cracked yet,"" said Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., who along with other anti-war Democrats has
pledged to be against any war funding that does not provide for the withdrawal of troops from southwest Asia.
Still, many Democrats said that the leadership was lobbying them relatively intensely.
More Details Emerge
Meanwhile, more details of the near finalized supplemental conference report negotiations came out Thursday.
Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Daniel K. Inouye, D-Hawaii, said that the final bill will ""in all
likelihood"" include money for 5 C-130 transport planes and 8 C-17 cargo planes, none of which was requested
by the administration or in the Senate's bill. The House bill had sought 11 C-130s and the 8 C-17s.
Overall, the defense portion of the bill is expected to be about $4 billion less than the House version but still
billions above the Senate version and the administration request, House Appropriations Defense subcommittee
chairman John P. Murtha, D-Pa., said.
As for the fate of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, the conference report likely will include language
barring the administration from transferring prisoners to U.S. soil for the remainder of the fiscal year, said
House Appropriator James P. Moran, D-Va.
No money towards the president's effort to close the prisons will be in the conference report, Moran added. The
president had requested $80 million but neither the House nor Senate versions included those funds.

A year later, Hillary wins
A year ago today, the final set of primaries made official the foregone conclusion that Barack Obama had won
the primary, and Hillary Clinton lost it.
There's far too much going on today to dwell on an anniversary, but it does seem worth noting one particular
piece of news in its light: On the central health care policy debate of the Democratic Primary -- which was, to
be fair, conducted within a fairly narrow frame -- Obama appears to have conceded today to a Senate plan likely
to more closely resemble Clinton's.
In a dense, careful letter to Ted Kennedy and Max Baucus, Obama offered his principles for a health care plan
and conceded on a central point: He is now open to an individual mandate, which he campaigned against, and
which is now being talked about by Senators of both parties with the buzzword ""shared responsibility.""
Obama still backs a ""hardship waiver"" for people unable to afford the mandate -- which is consistent with the
core of his objection to the mandate. But what he cast as a principled difference of approach -- was the problem
merely that people couldn't afford insurance? or something more? -- seems to have been conceded.
Here's the relevant paragraph:
I understand the Committees are moving towards a principle of shared responsibility -- making
every American responsible for having health insurance coverage, and asking that employers
share in the cost. I share the goal of ending lapses and gaps in coverage that make us less healthy
and drive up everyone's costs, and I am open to your ideas on shared responsibility. But I believe
if we are going to make people responsible for owning health insurance, we must make health
care affordable. If we do end up with a system where people are responsible for their own
insurance, we need to provide a hardship waiver to exempt Americans who cannot afford it. In
addition, while I believe that employers have a responsibility to support health insurance for their
employees, small businesses face a number of special challenges in affording health benefits and
should be exempted.

CONCEPT NOTE FOR WORLD FOOD PRIZE CEREMONY
Thursday, June 11, 2009
This speech is an opportunity to signal the urgency of the problem of global hunger; connect it to an array of
global issues, including economic development, health and education, expanding opportunity for women, and
political stability; and declare the Administration's commitment to tackling hunger at its roots, through effective
and efficient collaboration with an array of partners.
Additionally, your remarks can point to a shift from past approaches by emphasizing the need to support local
solutions and focus on long-term sustainability to help people feed themselves and reduce the need for
emergency assistance down the road.
The speech could be framed as follows:
THE PRIZE AND PRIZE-WINNER
You can begin by announcing the winner of the 2009 World Food Prize, Dr. Gebisa Ejeta. He has a remarkable
story: born in a mud hut in Ethiopia, he got his PhD from Purdue University in plant breeding and genetics and
developed strains of sorghum that are drought-tolerant, high-yield, and resistant to the Striga weed, which
devastates crops across Africa.
Outside the lab, he helped start the Sudanese commercial seed industry; developed systems to produce, certify,
and market hybrid seeds; and educated farmers about the use of fertilizers and soil and water conservation. And
he has trained and inspired the next generation of African agricultural scientists.
A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH: FROM LAB TO FARM TO MARKET TO TABLE
Dr. Ejeta's work reflects the breadth of this issue and the comprehensive approach needed to address it—one
that connects the labs where new seed technologies are developed.., the fields where small-scale farmers labor
to feed their families and make a living.., the markets where food is bought and sold... and the homes where
people get the nourishment they need to thrive.
In many places, that food chain is broken. One billion people worldwide woke up hungry this morning and will
go to sleep hungry tonight. Chronic hunger threatens health, while making it harder for people to work and
students to learn, which in turn stunts economic development. Last year's food riots demonstrated that when
food is scarce, political stability is threatened.
44
To date, the world's primary response to hunger has been to send emergency food aid. While this saves lives, it
is a short-term fix, and we need a long-term solution.
The Obama Administration is committed to leading in developing a new global approach. We will support the
creation of sustainable agricultural systems in appropriate regions around the world, to increase agricultural
productivity, create jobs, strengthen economies, and protect natural resources.
We will do this not by imposing one-size-fits-all solutions, but by assisting countries in carrying out individual
strategies that meet their needs—for example, through the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development
Plan. To facilitate coordination and share best practices, we will seek to convene donor governments,
multilateral institutions, NG0s, private companies, foundations, universities, and individuals.
THE ANCHORS OF OUR APPROACH
We've identified seven anchors that secure sustainable agriculture systems. These will guide our approach.
• Increase agricultural productivity by expanding access to quality seeds, fertilizer, irrigation, the credit to
purchase them, and the training to use them.
• Stimulate the post-harvest sector by improving the storage and processing of food and improving
transportation to connect small farmers to markets.
• Maintain natural resources so the land can be farmed well into the future and we can make the right
adaptations for the changing environment.
• Expand knowledge and training by support R&D and developing the next generation of agriculture
scientists.
• Increase trade so small-scale farmers in developing countries can sell their crops far and wide.
• Support policy reform and good governance, because sustainable agriculture flourishes in a clear and
predictable policy and regulatory environment.
• Support women and families in agriculture. Seventy percent of the world's farmers are women, but
most of the programs that offer credit and training to farmers target men. This must change for
agriculture to thrive. And children must have nutrition to contribute to their communities' future.
A PREVIEW OF WHAT'S TO COME
In the coming weeks, President Obama, Secretary Vilsack and I will be reaching out to share our approach to
global coordination and agriculture in greater detail. We will seek the input, wisdom and guidance of those who
have been working so long in this arena—from the Congress to NGOs to academics to foundations to the
private sector. The President's conversations at the G-8 meeting in Italy in two weeks will address our
approach, as well as my trip to Africa in August.
Addressing hunger and food is essential to achieving economic recovery, stabilizing societies, and expanding
opportunity for hundreds of millions of people worldwide. This is why supporting sustainable agriculture
worldwide will be a central element of foreign policy in the Obama Administration.
CONCLUSION
You can circle back to the story of Dr. Ejeta to close. He represents the need for a multinational
approach: born in Ethiopia, educated in the United States, advised by Indian scientists, advisor to several
African nations.

Goldwyn regarding this position, which the Secretary has offered and he has accepted. We now are in the devil
in the details position description both to encompass the scope and authority of the role to accomplish key
objectives in international energy security but also to fulfill the mission outlined by the legislation that the
Secretary embraced in QFRs from Senator Lugar (who created this position and has been unhappy about it's
double-hatting in the past rather than a dedicated staffing).
Please review and advise of any suggested edits or revisions. My goal is to seek to get this to David in the early

I am confident I did not capture all those goals — welcome your wisdom and guidance at your earliest

The Settlements Facts •
By Daniel Kurtzer
Sunday, June 14, 2009
Faulty analysis of the Israeli settlement issue is being passed off as fact. Charles Krauthanuner's June 5 column,
""The Settlements Myth,"" is one example.
Here are the facts: In 2003, the Israeli government accepted, with some reservations, the ""road map"" for peace,
which imposed two requirements on Israel regarding settlements: ""GO! [Government of Israel] immediately
dismantles settlement outposts erected since March 2001. Consistent with the Mitchell Report, GOI freezes all
settlement activity (including natural growth of settlements).""
Today, Israel maintains that three events -- namely, draft understandings discussed in 2003 between Prime
Minister Ariel Sharon and U.S. deputy national security adviser Stephen Hadley; President George W. Bush's
April 14, 2004, letter to Sharon; and an April 14 letter from Sharon adviser Dov Weissglas to national security
adviser Condoleezza Rice -- constitute a formal understanding in which the United States accepted continuing
Israeli building within the ""construction line"" of settlements. The problem is that there was no such
understanding.
The first event the Israelis cite is the 2003 discussions on a four-part draft that included the notion that
construction within settlements might be permitted if confined to the already built-up areas of the settlements.
The idea was to draw a line around the outer perimeter of built-up areas in settlements and to allow building
only inside that line. This draft was never codified, and no effort was made then to define the line around the
built-up areas of settlements. Nonetheless, Israel began to act largely in accordance with its own reading of
these provisions, probably believing that U.S. silence conferred assent.
Second, President Bush's 2004 letter conveyed U.S. support of an agreed outcome of negotiations in which
Israel would retain ""existing major Israeli population centers"" in the West Bank ""on the basis of mutually
agreed changes. . . ."" One of the key provisions of this letter was that U.S. support for Israel's retaining some
settlements was predicated on there being an ""agreed outcome"" of negotiations. Despite Israel's contention that
this letter allowed it to continue building in the large settlement blocs of Ariel, Maale Adumim and Gush
Etzion, the letter did not convey any U.S. support for or understanding of Israeli settlement activities in these or
other areas in the run-up to a peace agreement.
In his 2004 letter to Rice, Weissglas addressed the issue of the ""construction line,"" saying that ""within the
agreed principles of settlement activities, an effort will be made in the next few days to have a better definition
of the construction line of settlements in Judea & Samaria."" However, there never were any ""agreed principles
of settlement activities."" Moreover, the effort to define the ""construction line"" was never consummated: Israel
and the United States discussed briefly but did not reach agreement on the definition of the construction line of
settlements. Weissglas's letter also promised ""continuous action"" to remove all the unauthorized outposts, but
Israel removed almost none of them.
Throughout this period, the Bush administration did not regularly protest Israel's continuing settlement activity.
But this is very different from arguing that the United States agreed with it. In recent days, former senior Bush
administration officials have told journalists on background that no understandings existed with Israel regarding
continued settlement activity.
Commentators also focus on the Obama administration's reiteration that a freeze must include the ""natural
growth"" of settlements. Krauthammer says that this ""means strangling to death the thriving towns close to the
1949 armistice line. . . It means no increase in population. Which means no babies."" This is nonsense. No one
suggests that Israelis stop having babies. Rather, the blessing of a new baby does not translate into a right to
build more apartments or houses in settlements. The two issues have nothing to do with each other. Israelis, like
Americans, move all the time when life circumstances -- children, jobs, housing availability -- change.
The pattern of population growth in the territories actually undercuts the natural-growth argument. Since 1993,
when Israel signed the Oslo Accords, Israel's West Bank settler population has grown from 116,300 to 289,600.
The numbers in East Jerusalem increased from 152,800 to more than 186,000. This goes far beyond the natural
increase of families already living in the settlements. Inserting the provision of ""natural growth"" in official
documents started with the 2001 Mitchell Report and the 2003 ""road map,"" reflecting recognition that the
concept was being abused as a justification for expanding settlements. The Obama administration is pursuing
policies that every administration since 1967 has articulated -- that settlements jeopardize the possibility of
achieving peace and thus settlement activity should stop. This does not diminish the Palestinians'

1901,"fYiFYI, Gary Sick's latest analysis on Iran below (posted on his blog). Sick has independent sources and
is very well informed.
June 17, 2009
Is this another Iranian revolution?
To someone who has watched and studied the Iranian revolution of 1979 with fascination, developments
in Iran today have an eerie reminiscence. Then there were massive protests that filled the streets, often
marching in dignified but ominous silence; there was bloodshed as nervous security men with guns faced
determined but unarmed crowds; there were sullen mourning parades;20there were catchy chants and
ritual calls of ""Down with the shah!""; at night the rooftops rang with shouts of allahu akbar.
You need only change ""shah"" to ""dictator,"" and you have a description of what is happening in Iran
today.
But there is one very big difference. Thirty years ago, Iran had a charismatic cleric named Ayatollah
Khomeini who had a refined sense of strategy and a willingness to risk everything for the cause he
represented. On the other side was Mohammed Reza Shah, who had been on the throne for some 37
years and who commanded one of the most powerful military and security regimes in the world. On the
surface it appeared to be an uneven battle — guns against turbans — but the ruler with the guns wavered
and the turbans grew in size and confidence until the old order collapsed.
Today the nominal leader of the opposition forces is a reformed radical, Mir Hossein Mousavi, who is
notably lacking in personal charisma. On the other side is the constitutional Leader, Ayatollah
IChamene' i, who is widely perceived as a cautious political animal with limited qualifications for his
religious post and who compensates for his own lack of charisma by manipulation of the political system
and the institutions most loyal to him — particularly the politically minded clergy and the powerful
security forces, including the Revolutionary Guards.
Neither of these men seems to be fully in control of their own forces, let alone the situation. The
fraudulent election defeat of Mousavi was a triggering event, but the energy behind these unprecedented
demonstrations is due more to the sense of outrage and betrayal at the gross manipulation of numbers by
the regime than it is about any undying devotion to Mousavi. Yesterday Mousavi ordered that people
stay home in face of a conflicting pro-regime demonstration. They marched anyway (and the daughter of
former president Rafsanjani joined them and urged them on). Mousavi then ""ordered"" everyone to
march the following day (which they were probably going to do with or without his orders).
IChamene'i announced the ""divine assessment"" of the election outcome — even before it would probably
have been physically possible to count the more than 40 million ballots. Then, in the face of mass protests,
he ordered an investigation of the results by the Guardian Council— the same organization that was
responsible for managing the election in the first place. No one believed him in either case, and no one
expected anything of importance from the Guardian Council. Khamene'i has ordered peace and
reconciliation. No one paid any attention.
I deliberately did not mention president-elect Ahmadinejad. After celebrating his ""victory,"" he went off
to a largely symbolic meeting in Moscow. He seems to be out of the decision loop and more of a passive
player than a major actor in these events.
So who is calling the shots? Mousavi seems to be running along after the crowd, not leading it. But that is
probably all that is required to keep the protest in motion.
On the other side, the very little evidence we have suggests that the important decisions are being made
by the ultra-conservative leadership of the Revolutionary Guards, whose political role has ballooned over
the past decade, perhaps in cooperation with their extremist counterparts in the clergy. They are utterly
ruthless and ideologically fueled.
New York Times columnist Nick Kristoff reminded us several days ago (see blog item on June 15 below)
at the end of the day, as I saw at Tiananmen 20 years ago, when Might and Right do battle, it's often prudent
to bet on Might, at least in the short run.
The regime seems to have miscalculated badly. They seemed to believe that a sudden coup — the
announcement of dramatic election results followed by a show of force — would intimidate and silence the
opposition and consolidate their control. That is perhaps more understandable if the decisions were being
made by military leaders who tend to see the battle in Manichaean terms, rather than politicians such as
IChamene'i who are accustomed to seeing shades of gray. In any event, it b ackfired and they now have a
much larger crisis on their hands than if they had simply arranged for Ahmadinejad to win by a slim
margin (which was at least believable).
All parties are now in uncharted territory. A significant portion of the Iranian population seems to have
concluded that their social contract with the rulers — accepting Islamic rule in return for a respectful
regard for the opinion of the governed, an Islamic Republic — is no longer valid. They do not trust their
rulers.
The rulers, whose support has been declining for years in the face of their own inept management of the
country, are increasingly replacing popular support with repression. This election seems to have called
that tactic into question. For the military, the obvious answer is more repression. So it would appear to
be a moment to bet on Might.
But nobody is fully in command of events. Decisions taken in the next weeks will be fateful and could
determine the future path of the Iranian revolution.
There is another lesson as Iran's leaders contemplate a Tiananmen moment. When the Tiananmen
crackdown occurred almost exactly ten years ago, one of the leaders of China at the time was Zhao
Ziyang, General Secretary of the Communist Party. He was later fired and placed under house arrest.
His smuggled memoirs have just appeared, revealing the depth of disagreements within the lea dership
about how to proceed.
Is it possible that ten years from now we will have a volume describing the intense debates that one can
only presume are underway today in the highest councils of the Islamic Republic of Iran?

Day of Mourning, Protests, Called by Mousavi on Thursday
Mir-Hosain Mousavi, who maintains he won last Friday's presidential election despite official assertions that he
lost 2 to 1 to Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, is calling for another rally Thursday, this time in part to honor the
persons killed by hardliners or security forces in the course of previous demonstrations.
Mourning the martyr is as central to Iranian Shiite religious culture as it was to strains of medieval Catholicism
in Europe, and Mousavi's camp is tapping into a powerful set of images and myths here. The archetypal Shiite
martyr is Imam Husayn, the grandson of the Prophet Muhammad, who championed oppressed Muslims in Iraq
and was cut down by the then Umayyad Muslim Empire. Redognition that a Muslim state might commit the
ultimate in sacrilege by beheading a person who had been dangled on the Prophet's knee has imbued modern
political Shiism with a distrust of the state. When Husayn's head was brought to the Umayyad caliph Yazid and
deposited before his throne, older companions of the Prophet are said to have wept and remarked, ""I saw the
Prophet's lips on those cheeks."" Shiites ritually march, flagellate, and chant in honor of the martyred Imam or
divinely-appointed leader.
Today's protesters are wearing green, which symbolizes Mousavi's descent from the Prophet Muhammad.
(Mousavi's family name refers to the Seventh Imam (descendant of the Prophet with claims to divine
knowledge), Musa Kazim, whose tomb is in Kazimiya, north Baghdad. Sayyid families, those claiming descent
from the Prophet, often take one of the Imams' names as a family name to honor them, though of course they
are also claiming descent from the previous Imams right back to the Prophet.) The repertoires of protest the
reformists are using echo those of the 1978-79 Islamic Revolution-- they are chanting ""God is Great,"" mourning
pious fallen martyrs, etc.-- another sign that this movement is not just alienated secularized elites.
But now Mousavi's his supporters are also sporting black ribbons to indicate that they are in mourning for the
fallen. Typically, the dead will be commemorated again at one month and at 40 days. In 1978 such
demonstrations for those killed in previous demonstrations grew in size all through the year, till they reached an
alleged million in the streets of Tehran. Since the reformists are already claiming Monday's rally was a million,
you wonder where things will go from here.
The regime's attempt to paint the protesters as nothing more than US intelligence agents underlines how wise
President Obama has been not to insert himself forcefully into the situation in Iran. The reformers and the hard
liners are not stable groupings. The core of each is competing for the allegiance of the general Iranian public. If
the reformers can convince most Iranians of the justice of their cause, they will swing behind the opposition. If
the hard liners can convince the public that the reformers are nothing more than cat's paws of a grasping,
imperialist West-- i.e. that they are Ahmad Chalabis trying to bring Iran foreign occupation so as to get power
themselves-- then the reformists will be crushed. Iranians value national independence above all, having
suffered with a CIA-installed goverment for decades in the mid-twentieth century.
The prescriptions of John McCain and Faux Cable news for muscular US diplomacy at this point are tone deaf
to Iranian realities and would backfire big time, harming both the reform cause and US interests. Anyway, after
the basket case to which the US Republican Party reduced Iraq, no one in the global South is likely to want
them meddling in their internal affairs.
Reports are streaming in of the arrest of over a hundred opposition figures and of hard line militia men
following protesters home and breaking into their homes to terrorize them. See e.g., Basij paramilitary forces
terrorize residential complex. The Basij militiamen are said to be afraid to come out in numbers during the
opposition demonstrations, but sneak around at night to trail protesters and harass or arrest them.
Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei had met Tuesday morning with the representatives of all four presidential
candidates, urging them to make up but continuing to insist that Alunadinejad was the winner by 24 million to
14 million votes. He portrayed the massive post-election demonstrations and charges of ballot fraud as a minor
tiff.
Gary Sick wonders if Khamenei really is the supreme leader any more, and hints that the hard line tack of
stealing the election was directed by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, the country's religious national
guard.
Reports are coming in from Iran that allege that the regime is tracking down and destroying satellite dishes,
using helicopters for aerial surveillance of neighborhoods and Basij, the right wing militia (sort of like
Mussolini's Black Shirts) to do the breaking and entering. Kindly neighbors who have tried to warn suspected
satellite dish owners that the militiamen were coming have sometimes reportedly themselves been arrested.

The Myth of the $12 Million Uighur
. By STUART BECK
CONGRATULATIONS Palau. Our little country, a group of islands 500 miles east of the Philippines, has become, if only
briefly, a household word. President Obama, much admired in Palau, asked our new president, Johnson Toribiong, to do
the United States a favor: Please accept, as refugees, a group of innocent Chinese Muslims. They are not anti-American
terrorists, but victims of human rights violations, who landed at Guantanamo Bay for seven years. Innocent, stateless,
harmless.
President Toribiong, a lawyer trained at the University of Washington and a highly regarded litigator, told President
Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton that he needed to assure his people that the Uighurs were indeed harmless,
and could be integrated into Palau's small, diverse and friendly culture. Assuming that this due diligence brought
satisfactory results, Palau would be pleased to give the refugees temporary residence. Last weekend, he dispatched a
number of officials to Guantanamo to interview the Uighurs and review their records.
One would have thought that this positive gesture of friendship from a staunch American ally would have been applauded,
at least in the United States. Instead, for reasons that are beyond me, unattributed leaks and unsubstantiated rumors have
twisted Palau's act of decency into another grab for dollars by a cunning third-world country. In breaking the story that
Palau was amenable to President Obama's request, the Associated Press reported that two anonymous State Department
officials had linked Palau's acceptance of the Uighurs to a $200 million payoff.
Almost immediately, much of the news media took the bait, did the math and asserted that Palau was getting nearly $12
million dollars per Uighur. Within a day or two, The Wall Street Journal was pontificating against a shakedown.
Before the story gets too far out of hand, let's consider a few facts. It is true that the United States and Palau have an
economic relationship. Palau has been receiving American aid since it was wrested from the Japanese in 1944. (Over the
past 15 years, this has averaged about $56 million a year.) This aid has come with strings; as the United States has always
insisted that the Palauan government be ready to promptly turn over land for bases should the security of the United
States or Palau require it.
B6
In 1994, the two countries agreed to a 50-year option that allows the United States to use Palau for military purposes. That
agreement's economic terms expire in October 2009, and a new economic package for the remaining 35 years is in the
works — and has been for some time. But there has never been a mention of $200 million. And no one has even hinted at
linking the deal to Palau's acceptance of the Uighurs. The United States simply offered to pay relocation costs for the
Uighurs of less than $90,000 per person to cover transportation, food, housing and medical help until the men can get
oriented and get jobs.
Palau is a small and peaceful community. Its constitution bans weapons of all kinds. Capital crimes are virtually unknown.
Social life revolves around the family. Children wander from house to house. Could anyone believe that the leaders of
Palau would risk the safety and serenity of their modern Eden in exchange for money? Is it plausible that these close-knit
people would countenance the presence of terrorists in their midst? I can assure you the answer is no.
Last week, the Palauans lowered their flags to half-staff in memory of Sgt. Jasper Obakrairur, a Palauan who joined the
United States Marines and died on June 1 helping to root out the Taliban in Afghanistan. He was the fourth Palauan
serviceman to die in recent years, following his fallen comrades in American uniform Cpl. JayGee Meluat, Cpl.
Meresebang Ngiraked and Specialist Philton Ueld. The people of Palau are very proud of them, and of our country's special
relationship with the United States. Can't Americans be proud of the relationship, too?

Hope you are resting comfortably. Please take this as an excuse to get much needed rest. Lots of

if they haven't contacted you because you're behind a wall you should know that many, many people

I spoke this morning to Gary Sick, who, you recall, was senior person on NSC during the Iran hostage
crisis, and is now at Columbia. He has one of the best intelligence networks on Iran, 1,500 people,
experts with extensive contacts, and many Iranians, deeply embedded in the unfolding events
Gary tells me that Mousavi has evolved from a mild-mannered
reformer to directly challenging the regime. Nobody, he says, knows where this will go, certainly not
the Iranians. Khamenei has exposed himself and lost his aura of mystification, plunging into the arena
as a political player. Mousavi has issued a new revolutionary manifesto, just translated; I enclose
below Sick's report and analysis on it. This poses, Sick says, a new challenge to Khamenei. Does he
let it stand? Does he answer it? Sick also says US diplomacy in fact can't accomplish anything with
the regime until the crisis completely works its way out, which could take years. He points out that the
first mass demonstrations against the Shah occurred a full year before his overthrow. He adds that
the one thing the regime has learned fro m the Shah is not to be equivocal toward demonstrations.
Two ideas, who knows, but here they are: 1. Though the regime uses Western protests to consolidate
control, some of them contribute to its deep crisis of legitimacy. Sick says Obama's statement, for
example, was good. He also cites a statement from Ban Ki Moon. If there would be a UN action,
shouldn't it focus ont he human rights/violence aspect? A statement and/or resolution urging the
regime to stop illegitimate violence of paramilitary militias? US shouldn't initiate. 2. Establish linkage
in negotiations with Russians on Start between their objections to missile defense outposts in Poland
and Czech Republic (especially if we plan to give them up) with Russian arms sales to Iran.

5ousavi's New Revolutionary Manifesto
by Gary Sick
June 21, 2009 I 10:51am
—
L Alfred, Sipa / AP Photo The Iranian protest movement reached a tipping point today, writes Gary Sick,
•
the key White House offical during the 1979 hostage crisis, and what has emerged is nothing short of a platform for
a true Islamic democracy.
Plus, read more insight on Iran's election from other Daily Beast writers.
Today, Mir Hossein Mousavi, the presidential candidate who has come to represent the democratic aspirations
of the Iranian people, issued a formal statement.
Although he denounces the ""lies and fraud"" of the leadership, particularly in the recent election, he views the
fraudulent election as only as the symptom of something far more serious. He describes a revolution gone
wrong, a revolution that was originally based on attention to the voice of the peo ple but has resulted in ""forcing
an unwanted government on the nation.""
It is apparent from this statement that Mousavi's movement—and Mousavi himself—have evolved enormously
in the past week.
This moment is ""a turning point,"" he says, and he defines the movement that is forming around him as having a
""historical mission"" to accomplish nothing less than ""renewing the life of the nation"" according to its own
ideals.
He acknowledges, interestingly, that his own voice at the beginning was less ""eloquent"" than he would have
wished and that the people were ahead of him in turning the movement green. But now he accepts the ""burden
of duty put on our shoulders by the destiny of generations and ages.""
He denounces both extremes of the political spectrum: on one hand those who believe that ""Islamic government
is the same as Tyranny of the Rightful;"" and on the other, those who ""consider religion and Islam to be blockers
for realization of republicanism,"" i.e. those who believe that democracy is incompatible with Islam.
Mousavi says his call for annulment of the election and a revote, supervised by an impartial national body, ""is a
given right."" The objective is nothing less than ""to achieve a new type of political life in the country.""
That is truly a revolutionary statement. He says he will stand by the side of all those seeking ""new solutions"" in
a n on-violent way. He accepts the principles and the institutions of the Islamic Republic, including the
Revolutionary Guard and the basij, but denounces ""deviations and deceptions."" He demands reform ""that
returns us to the pure principles of the Islamic Revolution.""
He calls for freedom of expression in all its forms, and says that if the government permits people to express
their views freely, ""there won't be a need for the presence of military and regulatory forces in the streets.""
It is apparent from this statement that Mousavi's movement—and Mousavi himself—have evolved enormously
in the past week. The candidate started as a mild-mannered reformer. After the searing events of the past several
days, he has dared to preach a counter sermon to Khamene'i's lecture on Islamic government. Although he never
mentions the Leader by name, there is no overlooking the direct contradiction of his arguments. This open
opposition to the Leader by a political figure is unprecedented. •
Mousavi has in fact issued a manifesto for a new vision of the Islamic Republic. The repression and disdain of
the government has brought the opposition to a place they probably never dreamed of going. And no one knows
where any of the parties are likely to go next.
But for outside observers, it is like standing on the edge of a glacier and feeling the ice begin to crack under
your feet.

Executive Summary
Working from the province by province breakdowns of the 2009 and 2005
results, released by the Iranian Ministry of Interior, and from the 2006 census
as published by the official Statistical Centre of Iran, the following observations
about the official data and the debates surrounding it can be made.
•In two conservative provinces, Mazandaran and Yazd, a turnout of
more than 100% was recorded.
•At a provincial level, there is no correlation between the increased
turnout and the swing to Ahmadinejad. This challenges the notion that
Ahmadinejad's victory was due to the massive participation of a
previously silent conservative majority.
•In a third of all provinces, the official results would require that
Ahmadinejad took not only all former conservative voters, all former
centrist voters, and all new voters, but also up to 44% of former
Reformist voters, despite a decade of conflict between these two
groups.
•In 2005, as in 2001 and 1997, conservative candidates, and
Ahmadinejad in particular, were markedly unpopular in rural areas.
That the countryside always votes conservative is a myth. The claim
that this year Ahmadinejad swept the board in more rural provinces
flies in the face of these trends.

1. Irregularities in Voter Turnout
Two provinces show a turnout of over 100% and four more show a turnout of
over 90%. Regional variations in participation have disappeared. There is no
correlation between the increase in participation, and the swing to
Ahm adinejad.
Firstly, across the board there is a massive increase in turnout, with several
provinces increasing their participation rate by nearly 75%. This increase
results in substantially less variation in turnout between provinces, with the
standard deviation amongst provincial turnouts falling by just over 23% since
2005. The 2005 results show a substantial turnout gap, with seven provinces
recording turnout below 60%, and ten above 70%. In 2009, only two were
below 70% and 24 were above 80%. In fact, 21 out of 30 provinces had
turnouts within 5% of 83%. The data seems to suggest that regional variations
in participation have suddenly disappeared.
This makes the evident lack of any sort of correlation between the provinces
that saw an increase in turnout and those that saw a swing to Ahmadinejad
(Fig.1) all the more unusual. There is no significant correlation between the
increase in participation for a given province and the swing to Ahmadinejad
(Fig.1). This lack of correlation makes the argument that an increase in
participation by a previously silent conservative majority won the election for
Ahmadinejad somewhat problematic.
Furthermore, there are concerns about the numbers themselves. Two
provinces, Mazandaran and Yazd, have results which indicate that more votes
were cast on 12 June than there were eligible voters and that four more
provinces had turnouts in the mid-nineties.
In a country where allegations of 'tombstone voting' — the practice200f using the
identity documents of the deceased to cast additional ballots — are both longstanding
and widespread, this result is troubling but perhaps not unexpected.
This problem did not start with Ahmadinejad; according to official statistics
gathered by the International institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance
in Stockholm, there were 12.9% more registered voters at the time of
Mohammed Khatami's 2001 victory than there were citizens of voting age.
In conclusion, a number of aspects of the reported turnout figures are
problematic. The massive increases from 2005, the collapse of regional
variations, and the absence of any clear correlation between increases in
turnout and increased support for any candidate on their own make the results
problematic.

2. Where did Ahmadinejad's New Votes Come From?
According to the official Ministry of Interior voting data (see Appendix),
Mahmud Ahmadinejad has increased the conservative vote by 113%
compared to the 2005 election. There is little correlation in provincial level
results between the increase in turnout and the swing to the President,
challenging the notion that a previously silent conservative majority has come
out to support him. Interestingly, in 1.0 out of 30 provinces, mainly former
Mehdi Karrubi strongholds, the official data suggests that Ahmadinejad
received not only the votes of all former non-voters and former Rafsanjani
voters, but also took up to 44% of the vote from those who had previously
voted Reformist.
According to the official data1, Mahmud Ahmadinejad has received
approximately 13m more votes in this election than the combined conservative
vote in the 2005 Presidential election2.
Assuming that Ahmadinejad retained all 11.5m Conservative votes from 2005,
these additional 13m votes could have come from three sources, in
descending order of likelihood:
•The approximately 10.6m citizens who did not vote in 2005, but chose
to vote in this election
•The 6.2m citizens who voted for the centrist Rafsanjani in 2005
•The 10.4m citizens who voted for Reformist candidates in 2005
In order to examine in detail where Ahmadinejad's increased support came
from, the table below (Fig.3) shows the composition of the 2009 vote by
province, dividing it into those who voted Conservative, Rafsanjani, and
Reformist in 2005, and those who did not vote at all in 2005. It assumes that
2005 voters will vote again.
The table demonstrates that in the 10 of Iran's 30 provinces highlighted red, in
order for the official statistics to be correct Ahmadinejad would have needed to
win over all new voters, all former Rafsanjani voters, and also up to 44% of
former reformist voters.
1 Serious complaints have been raised about both the 2005 elections and the 2009
elections. Government data is not perfectly reliable.
2 In 2005 there were three Conservative candidates in the first round. Ahmadinejad can
reasonably be expected to have received in 2009, all votes cast for Conservatives in
2005. Here, Ahmadinejad's 2009 performance is compared to the combined
performance of all three Conservatives in 2005.

It is notable that many of these are provinces where the Reformist cleric Mehdi
Karrubi polled highly in 2005, and the government's figures would appear to
suggest that his former supporters have not voted tactically for the likely
Reformist challenger Mir Hussein Musavi, as many had expected, but rather
that they have defected to the hard-line conservative incumbent Ahmadinejad.
This interpretation is to some extent supported by the relationship between the
percentage of former Karrubi voters in a province, and its swing to
Ahmadinejad (Fig.2).
To many Reformists, this situation is extremely unlikely. Mehdi Karrubi is a
well-known reformist, of polar opposite views to Ahmadinejad on issues of
political and cultural freedoms, economic management, and foreign policy.
They allege fraud, and it is likely that the provinces where Karrubi's vote has
collapsed will provide the bulk of the 600+ complaints which the defeated
c andidates are lodging against the conduct of the election.
However, Karrubi, like Ahmadinejad, is seen as a 'man of the people', and
Ahmadinejad is as much a re-incarnation of the Islamic Republic's early hard
left as he is a leader of its current hard-right. Ahmadinejad's supporters thus
claim that rural voters voted for Ahmadinejad in 2009 for precisely the same
reasons that they voted for Karrubi in 2005.
The data offers no arbitration in this dispute, although Roukema's application
of statistical fraud detection techniques to the 'by district' data has turned up
some anomalies with respect to the figures for Karrubi's vote,3 which may
suggest that they were created by a computer. These can be followed up
should the fully disaggregated 'by polling station' data be released during the
ongoing dispute.

3. Do Rural Voters Support Ahmadinejad?
Many commentators have suggested, before and after the Presidential
Election, that Ahmadinejad is very popular in rural areas and that this explains
his high levels of support. However, the data from the 2005 Presidential
election does not support this contention. Instead, it confirms that what
support Ahmadinejad did gain in 2005 was mainly from urban and suburban
areas. The graphs below show the levels of support for Ahmadinejad against
the rural population of the province in question (Fig.4) and Conservatives as a
group (Fig.5).

Source: Ministry of Interior Publications 2005 and 2009 and Iranian Census of
2006 (see appendix)
This data supports the con tention of academic experts on rural Iranian politics4
that rural voters have not been the dedicated Ahmadinejad supporters
occasionally described in western media. This is supported by the fact that
much of Iran's rural population is comprised of ethnic minorities: Lors, Baluch,
•
Kurdish, and Arab amongst others. These ethnic minorities have a history both
of voting Reformist and of voting for members of their own ethnic group. For
example, they were an important segment of Khatami's vote in 1997 and 2001
and voted largely for Karrubi and Mostafa Moin in 2005.
The 2009 data suggests a sudden shift in political support with precisely these
rural provinces, which had not previously supported Ahmadinejad or any other
conservative (Fig.5) showing substantial swings to Ahmadinejad (Fig.6). At the
same time, the official data suggests that the vote for Mehdi Karrubi, who was
extremely popular in these rural, ethnic minority areas in 2005, has collapsed
entirely even in his home province of Lorestan, where his vote has gone from
440,247 (55.5%) in 2005 to just 44,036 (4.6%) in 2009. This is paralleled by
an overall swing of 50.9% to Ahmadinejad, with official results suggesting that
he has captured the support of 47.5% of those who cast their ballots for

Reformist candidates in 2005. This, more than any other result, is highly
implausible, and has been the subject of much debate in Iran.
This increase in support for Ahmadinejad amongst rural and ethnic minoritiy
voters is out of step with previous trends, extremely large in scale, and central
to the question of why (or indeed whether) he won in June 2009.

Tue, 06/23/2009 - 1:00pm
Longtime journalist and former Clinton White House advisor Sidney Blumenthal will become a special advisor
without portfolio to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, The Cable has learned. Blumenthal refused to comment.
But sources say he is filling out the paperwork and disentangling himself from other obligations as he moves to
become a special advisor to the secretary whose presidential campaign he helped advise. The position would
not require Senate confirmation.
Clinton, who is recovering from surgery to repair a broken elbow, has been building her team at the State
Department, while establishing her credentials as a team player supporting and amplifying her former
presidential rival's foreign-policy vision. Sources close to her says she will prove indispensable to Obama, a
point several Obama aides also made to Politico's Ben Smith in a piece noting the relatively background role
she has played in these early months. The planned addition of Blumenthal, a longtime confidant of the Clinton
family and a fierce defender of Bill Clinton's presidential legacy, could indicate she plans to raise her profile.
(Blumenthal is probably Clinton's best speechwriter, a friend notes.)
In the foreign-policy arena, Blumenthal advised former President Clinton on U.S.-British relations, and first
introduced him to future British Prime Minister Tony Blair. He has also been active in the Third Way-
Progressive Governance process. A former Washington Post reporter, Blumenthal has contributed
commentary and editorial advice to Vanity Fair, Tina Brown's new online magazine The Daily Beast, the New
Yorker, and Salon. Blumenthal has also been a fellow at New York University's Center on Law and Security.

Basically he's not honoring his fathers dying wish but since constitution says it should be son (with brother as option) he
has clear authority to do it. I personally think this shows confidence in his position as he's not worried about an outcry
from his fathers loyalists.",[]
1978,"Re: King Abdullah names Prince Hussein Crown PrinceWell he's very young, only 15.
Rumor is hes smart, quiet, bookish. Like his father.
What is interesting is that the reason abdullah gave from removing his brother 5 years ago is that he thought the weight
of being crown prince restricted his life, education and travel. I suspect the reason he's done this is so his son can be
properly groomed from now to inherit the thrown. Life will change dramatically for him.",[]

Release Detail
July 7, 2009 - Obama's Approval Drops In Ohio - Critical Swing State, Quinnipiac University Poll Finds;
2010 Senate Race Tips Slightly To Democrats
Word format
President Barack Obama gets a lackluster 49 - 44 percent approval rating in Ohio, considered by many to be the
most important swing state in a presidential election, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released today.
This is President Obama's lowest approval rating in any national or statewide Quinnipiac University poll since
he was inaugurated and is down from 62 - 31 percent in a May 6 survey.
By a small 48 - 46 percen t margin, voters disapprove of the way Obama is handling the economy, the
independent Quinnipiac (KWIN-uh-pe-ack) University poll finds. This is down from a 57 - 36 percent approval
May 6. A total of 66 percent of Ohio voters are ""somewhat dissatisfied"" or ""very dissatisfied"" with the way
things are going in the state, while 33 percent are ""very satisfied"" or ""somewhat satisfied,"" numbers that haven't
changed since Obama was elected.
In the race for Ohio's U.S. Senate seat being vacated by retiring George Voinovich in 2010, Lee Fisher and
Jennifer Brunner remain neck-and-neck for the Democratic nomination and both would defeat any of the GOP
candidates if the election were today.
""The economy in Ohio is as bad as anywhere in America. These numbers indicate that for the first time voters
have decided that President Barack Obama bears some responsibility for their problems,"" said Peter A. Brown,
assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute.
""Until now voters have given President Obama high ratings on the economy, blaming former President George
W. Bush for their problems. They might be taking out their frustration on President Obama, possibly deciding
that the change he promised has not come as quickly as they expected.""
""Ohio historically has been the prototypical swing state. One of the reasons Barack Obama won the p residency
by such a wide margin is that he carried Ohio with 52 percent of the vote and captured the lion's share of
independent votes,"" Brown added.
""Now, by a 48 - 46 percent margin, Ohio independent voters give the President a failing grade on the economy.
These numbers indicate that he may be losing, at least for now, some of those who voted for him in November
and should be an indication to the White House that his honeymoon with the voters may be ending.""
In the Senate race, Lt. Gov. Lee Fisher holds a 24 - 21 percent lead over Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner in
the race for the Democratic nomination, with 51 percent undecided.
Former U.S. Rep. Rob Portman holds a 33 - 10 percent lead over car dealer Tom Ganley on the Republican
side, with 55 percent undecided.
In general election trial heats, Brunner would defeat Ganley 35 - 31 percent and get 35 percent to Portman's 34
percent. Fisher leads Ganley 36 - 30 percent and Portman 37 - 33 percent.
From June 26 - July 1, Quinnipiac University surveyed 1,259 Ohio voters, with a margin of error of +/- 2.8
percentage points. The survey includes 483 Democrats with a margin of error of +/- 4.5 percentage points and
445 Republicans with a margin of error of +/-4.7 percentage points.
The Quinnipiac University Poll, directed by Douglas Schwartz, Ph.D., conducts public opinion surveys in
Florida, Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Ohio and the nation as a public service and for
research. For more data and RSS feed - http://www.quinnipiac.edu/polling.xml, or (203) 582-5201.

Can National Security Adviser James Jones Survive
a Second Round of Attacks and ""Longer Knives""?
I am here in London where I'm participating in an interesting forum sponsored by the Princeton Project on
National Security and the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) Transatlantic Program, I've received not just
one email -- but three -- from prominent insider journalists and policy hands that Jim Jones' tenure as National
Security Adviser is highly fragile.
One of these emails reports starkly:
Knives getting longer
That's all my contact said. But other emails have intimated to me a serious tone-deafness by Jones about his role
and responsibilities, his relationship with the President, and his relationship with younger, dedicated,
hardworking and late-working staff. Jones recently said that National Security Council staff members that
stayed longer than 7:30 pm must be disorganized in their work.
I speak to various NSC officials -- often at 10:00 or 11:00 pm at night. They are hardworking, racing as fast as
they can to manage the many, many, many major initiatives that Barack Obama has decided to simultaneously
pursue.
James Jones is considered by his admirers to be a genius when thinking about management structures and
decision-making processes. On the other hand, his critics see him as a plodding, slow-moving, out of touch
retired general who was better prepared to think about the last era rather than the one we are moving into. His
°critics think that he's just too unable to animate nimble, high flex policy decision making products for a White
House on a manic dash to get a lot of top tier issues dealt with.
Friends at the National Security Council respect a great deal the way in which NSC Deputy Tom Donilon is
managing his brief Many see him picking up the load that Jones seems unable or unwilling to carry. Donilon is
deeply engaged in the broad Middle East and Iran portfolio, the non-proliferation/WMD/arms control portfolio,
the China economic and security portfolio, and he has -- according to reports -- supported and helped cultivate
relationship building between State, DoD, the NSC, and other parts of the national security bureaucracy.
Some tell me that James Jones decided to try and remove himself from the ""whack-a-mole"" crisis reaction style
of decision-making that could rob the Obama administration of the chance to define a new course in national
security affairs. Tom Donilon, according to reports, wields far more the hand of power when it comes to day to
day management and responding to crises that require presidential attention and response.
Jones, in contrast, has been obsessed with the structure of decisions -- who is involved in those decisions, what
the structure of decision-making should be, and what legal modifications to this process need to be made. He
looks at that as the big nut that needs to be cracked -- and that would improve, according to Jim Jones, the
President's effectiveness and chances of success at a macro level.
Jones' self-determined task is not high profile, mostly structural, and has not won him many admirers for
leadership -- but what he is doing is necessary. If he departs his role, this challenge of dealing with the growing
complexity of national security threats and the vital need to recalibrate the policy making and decision-making
process will require the attention of someone serious.
So, whether Jones stays or goes -- his portfolio will remain vital.
But what is clear is that Jones has enemies and that they are trying to undermine his place in the Obama orbit.
Their motives may not be earnest concern about the tempo or pace of Jones' management style -- but they very
well could be his unwillingness to allow the liberal interventionists inside the Obama administration to have
more than their fair share of power in the Obama decision-making process.
Jones has structured an all views on the table approach to decision making -- quite evident when it comes to
Middle East policy -- and the hawkish/neocon-friendly/Likudist-hugging part of the Obama administration's
foreign policy operation may be engaged in a coup attempt against Jones.
I don't know if he'll survive this latest effort to oust him -- but folks need to know that those ""longer knives"", on
the whole, do not have pure motives.

I hope that your elbow is healing quickly. I mentioned that we were doing some work on maritime developments in the
region from the Persian Gulf to the East China Sea and Sea of Japan. Below are key findings from the report, but the
main takeaway is that the political impact of Chinese military modernization may be greater than a narrow technical
analysis of China's capabilities would suggest, and for a range of reasons, technical and political, prospects for regional
cooperation are limited, but pathways to conflict are numerous and increasing.
All best, Jackie
Key findings from the workshop include:
• Chinese naval modernization has proceeded at rates higher than
forecast 10 years ago and has created the capability to complicate operation of US carrier battle groups within 1,000
kilometers of the Chinese coastline.
• The Indian Ocean may in the coming decades be the operating area of
SSBNs from countries with limited experience in sustained SSBN patrols, including India, China, and possibly Pakistan.
• Chinese maritime relations with countries along the littoral area
have continued to develop, with a new friendly relationship emerging with Sri Lanka, to complement the existing
relations with Myanmar and Pakistan. This may lead to a new form of ""blue-brown water"" naval operations, in which
Chinese naval forces operate far from Chinese bases, but close to the coasts of client states.
The workshop tended to the conclusion that the trends in the region were not such as to make maritime cooperation
easy. These trends
include:
Japanese concern that Chinese dominance in the waters within 1,000
miles of Chinese territory has immediate consequences for Japan's maritime autonomy.
• Indian suspicion of Chinese naval developments in Hainan Island,
Chinese development of port infrastructure in Pakistan and Myanmar, and the possibility of Chinese ballistic missile
submarines operating close to India.
• Indian interest in SSBNs, plus Chinese SSBN ports in Hainan and
even, possibly, Pakistani SSBNs, all of which creates the possibility of multiple SSBN patrols in the Indian Ocean, along
with the potential for naval nuclear accidents at sea.
• Asymmetries in levels of operational competence, and technology, in
submarines and maritime aviation, which, for example, make functional multi-national naval cooperation harder for
states that are afraid of revealing technologies or weaknesses.
• The major role of land-based maritime warfare strike complexes in
this region, which means that war at sea always carries with it the risk of escalation to strikes on ground targets in
homeland areas.
The report also offers two scenarios under which the United States may consider engaging militarily in the region.
The first scenario, which concerns a clash between Japan and China in waters claimed by both, compels us to consider:
• The circumstances under which the Chinese may seek to demonstrate
that their new maritime capabilities must be taken seriously and respected, and
• What the United States would lose if it did not support the
Japanese, and then faced a world in which Japan became either a subordinate power to China or a nuclear armed state,
capable of pursuing its national interest independent of the United States.
The second scenario concerns an American naval blockade of an Iran that has tested a nuclear weapon, potentially
giving rise to an interaction between the United States and China far from the operating bases of each but close to
territory of a client of China, a ""blue-brown water"" clash. In this scenario, China is using its navy to show presence, and
to force the United States to ask itself whether it wants to go to war with China over a political conflict that is less than
black and white. Thinking about the options that would be left to the United States under these circumstances
underscores how Chinese naval forces may have more political impact by 2025 than a narrow assessment of their
military capabilities would suggest.

2088,"Palau offended by US positionsBelow is the statement of very impressive Palau reps at the end of a session of required meetings on the next
phase of free association aid. FYI only, the Palauans were insulted by the nature and depth of the response to
their proposal as well as the content and the overall approach. They are even privately questioning the
relationship. (This hasn't affected their intent to take the Uighurs.) I will send a few further thoughts.
At the conclusion of yesterday's meeting, the Palau delegation caucused to discuss its reaction to the response of the United
States delegation to the proposals that it made in June in Washington D.C., and expanded upon in subsequent communications.
While the Palau delegation has agreed to respond to certain additional questions raised by the United States delegation on specific
elements of the Palau proposal, and further has agreed to participate in certain working groups on specific issues, the Palau
delegation was deeply disappointed with the response of the United States delegation. The United States delegation did not
seriously respond, as required by the Compact, to the operational requirements of the Government of Palau or to Palau's
comprehensive and considered plans to achieve economic advancement and self-sufficiency.
In light of the foregoing, the Palau delegation has determined that it must now return to Palau to discuss with President Toribiong
the next steps that Palau needs to take regarding the Compact. Thank you.

ps Saw that Foreign Minister Yeo was on your schedule today. Fyi, he is one of my favorite Singaporeans
because of this 2007 speech on China, which he posted to his blog (!):
April 12, 2007
Foreign Minister George Yeo's speech at a dinner organised by the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy on 5
February 2007, which he gave off-the-cuff.
Thank you Kishore for your kind words. Dear friends, ladies and gentlemen. I was in India two weeks ago, had
a good trip, spent nine days there. While in Calcutta after calling on the Chief Minister, I had a bit of time to
look around so I attended a mass at Mother Theresa's house. Very interesting gathering; there was a Singapore
nun there, she had been there for over ten years; Sister Maria Tony. I wondered why someone from Singapore
would want to dedicate her life to picking up the dead and the dying in the back alleys of Calcutta and living
that life. There were many nuns there who were in their ninth year. They take their first vow in the fifth year,
renewable every year. In the tenth year they have to decide - final vows for eternity. So if you are not sure,
please, there's a way out; if you are sure, then you're in the room. So the priest gave a very tough sermon and
while he was talking, I could hear the din of traffic noise outside, in the streets of Calcutta. Then suddenly, I
heard the call of the muezzin. Now this is a Hindu city. I told myself, I thought wow, what diversity in this
country, India, and its ability to internalise this diversity and to find it unremarkable that the tiny woman from
Albania should come into their midst, become one of them and then when she was beatified, was celebrated as
an Indian, on the way to canonization.
China and India in that comparison- China is not India. China has a very different sense of itself; its deep
internal construction is very different. Superficially there are similarities, as there is between China and the US
and China and Europe. But if you look into it's deep construction, it is very different. When we talk about
China's future and China in the 21st century, how China will behave in a world community, China's attitudes
towards democracy, towards law, towards social justice. It is important first to look into this deep construction
because that is their nature. Naturally we should not be deterministic, there is nothing inevitable in human
history, but when we understand its nature, it becomes easier to anticipate its moves and you'll be less suprised
by its actions.
A few years ago, the Chinese government embarked on a major project which is its dynastic duty- to write the
history of the Qing dynasty, the Manchus, from 1368 to 1644. Ever since the Han dynasty, roughly
contemporaneous with the Roman Empire, they developed a historiographic tradition of each dynasty writing
the history of the previous period. So Sima Qian of the Later Han wrote of the earlier Han and the entire period
before that; then later on they wrote about the Later Han, Jin wrote up the Three Kingdoms; Ming wrote up the
Yuan: The Yuan, which was Mongol in its origins wrote up the Sung. Sung wrote up the Tang dynasty which
was the Classical Period. The last dynasty, the Qing, collapsed in the Republican Revolution of 1911; this is
now 2007. I think in 2003, they embarked on this project, 'The Official History of the Qing dynasty'. When the
former Vice Premier Li Lanqing was in Singapore recently, I asked him about it. He said ""we told the scholars
not to rush this project"". I asked him how long it would take to write this history. He said it would take many
years, easily 10 years. I said, ""have you collected the material?"" He said yes. I asked, ""external sources?"" He
said yes, external sources too. All the countries, the Vatican, European countries, the whole lot; all assembled -
24 official histories, this would be the 26th. And Li's instruction to them was not to be too quick to draw
conclusions!
Now Mao Tze Tung was a revolutionary, he was a great revolutionary. He overturned everything before but he
knew his history, he read the 24 histories, and not only did he read them, he annotated them. But he wrote with
a terrible, illegible scrawl, so scholars had to decipher those scrawls. Then they wrote commentaries on his
commentaries and now it's all published. It is very difficult for the Chinese to depart from their own history
because it's the same great plains, the same mountains more or less, the same neighbours more or less and they
have seen the same patterns recur. So a long time ago during the Ming dynasty they wrote up the romantic
period of the Three Kingdoms. The first line said: ""Below heaven, great movements, great currents, long
disunity leads to unity and long unity leads to disunity."" So they accept as a part of their own deep nature that
there are cycles in their civilisation; that they have ups and downs. In recent years, when you visit them, you
could sense them feeling their own re-emergence, it's a bit scary. In the initial years, they were lacking in
confidence, they asked many questions, but now they know that there is an organic vitality. It is like an
adolescent who watches his own development, and conscious of it. I say scary because for those of us who live
on the periphery of that empire, what happens there will radiate its influence on us and eventually, to a greater
or lesser degree envelope us.
How do we see China? I think to begin with, it's important not to try and, from an intellectual viewpoint,
transpose our own experiences on to China, because I believe it will develop according to its own logic,
according to its own DNA. It is growing now, it will continue to grow, it will develop its own contradictions
and one day those contradictions, many years from now, will lead to its own decline. So they say at the
beginning of a dynasty the taxes are light but the treasury is full, and at the end of a dynasty, the taxes are
crushing but the treasury is empty. The important thing to realise about China is that some things are deeply
resistant to change. Take Confucius. Every time they had to overturn a dynasty, they had to overturn Confucius,
because Confucius justified the status quo. So throughout the 19th century, whether it was the Taiping
Revolution, the Communist movement or Sun Yat Sen; they spent their lives debunking Confucius. It reached
its final moment when they criticised Zhou Enlai together with Confucius- no- Lin Biao together with
Confucius. That was the last paroxysm. Today, Hu Jingtao said [in Mandarin He Xie She Hui ], ""harmonious
society"". Suddenly you hear the resonance of Confucius coming back. And everywhere in the world on the
pattern of Alliance Francaise, the Goethe Institute, the USIA, they establish Confucius Institutes and the
learning of the Confucianist classics are coming back with remarkable force in China, not yet in the state
curriculum but just parents wanting to teach their children the Confucianist ditties. Now why is this important?
From Mao to Deng to Jiang Zemin, at every stage, they re-interpreted Marx. They are comfortable with the
young Marx, the idea of the superstructure on the economic base, the idea that politics is concentrated
economics- that they like. But the class struggle, they downplay. They talk about the Three Represents, the
progressive forces, the progressive elements, they nurture those. Now Hu Jingtao says ""harmonious society"",
""peaceful re-emergence"". This mindset has a certain attitude towards law, has a certain attitude towards religion,
towards democracy and towards foreign policy and I would like, to deal with each in turn.
Joseph Needham many years ago, I think in the 60's, the man who wrote The Science and Civilisation of China,
that great encyclopedic work; he said its not that the Chinese have no legal tradition. In fact, by his estimation,
the Chinese had a greater corpus of legal codification than the West. A greater corpus of legal codification than
the West! Surprise, surprise. But the idea that the Emperor is below the law, that is completely alien to their
thinking. Where did that idea come from? Well in the West, you may trace it back to Hammurabi, you may
trace it back to Moses, to Greece, to Rome. But if you trace the evolution of that DNA, it goes back, way back,
into its early beginnings. The Chinese had a very different evolutionary starting point. It was not in law, it was
in an idea they call '1i' which is proper conduct among human beings. They believe, deep in their instincts, that
law is only a means towards justice, and that when the outcome of law is perverse, then that law must be
overridden, because justice, proper conduct, the proper relationship among human beings must take
precedence. And to suddenly say that all that had happened in the previous dynasties, all that the earlier
histories have summarised, are all wrong and that they should instead adopt something with its origins in
Western Europe, which had as its crowning moment the crowning of Charlemagne by the Pope in the year 800;
to them, what are you talking about? For the Chinese, laws are more like regulations, means towards a larger
end. Their attitude towards democracy follows a parallel pattern.
Democracy is not an end in itself, democracy is a means and they are quite happy to consider democracy as a
useful means towards government and that at appropriate places and appropriate levels, democracy is good. So
at the village and the township level they have democracy, it is a universal franchise. They approve a slate of
candidates, and they have fierce elections, fierce campaigning, and those who are incompetent or arrogant or
despotic, they get chucked out. But once you reach the level of the cities and the provinces, they say no. No
direct democracy. Why not? Because they do not believe, with their view of the universe, that that is the way to
produce good government. Any more than the Catholic Church believes that the way to elect the Pope is
through universal franchise. That the parishioners should decide who should be the parish priest. The Parish
Council, maybe, that's ok. But the parish priest? Bishops? Universal franchise? That's against God's laws. They
have that kind of instinct embedded in them, it is not Communist, it is just Chinese. And they know that too
much democracy, invariably leads to 'localitis'; of favouritism towards friends, relatives, people who are from
the same villages whom we have a relationship with.
We have the same problem in Singapore, in fact this problem exists throughout East Asia. Till today, apart from
Singapore, among Chinese communities and among many East Asian communities, the idea that ultimate
control of the business should go outside the family is unpersuasive. You talk to Li Ka-shing, you talk to Robert
Kwok, you talk to Lim Soe Liong, you talk to any of them; they will go back to the family. Why? Because they
believe that in the end, what matters at the deepest level, is trust. And the family guarantees you that trust.
This is also the Indian wisdom. So you have the Marwaris controlling the economy of Calcutta, you have the
Parsees, you have Sindhis, of which Kishore is a member, you have the Chettiars. They operate on the basis of
deep trust and at a completely different level from that of contract law. And because they distrust local
affiliations, in two dynasties, Ming and Qing, no senior official could serve within 400 miles of where he was
born. No local official to serve within 400 miles, so in other words, in Singapore, no Singaporean can govern
Singapore. They go beyond that, today there's almost no province in China where the provincial leader is from
that province. Now you consider this, you transpose this onto Europe, it's as if routinely, the President of France
is not French. And if you are a German, you are disqualified as a Chancellor of the Republic. And an Italian
cannot be trusted to serve in Rome. Ancient wisdom! What is remarkable is this is accepted as legitimate. If you
are Cantonese and you have a Northener squatting over you, you do not consider it perverse or an abomination.
This is part of life and in fact, you are more likely to have impartial governor than if a local boy were to be
there, because he is more likely to favour those who are related to him or those who are his friends.
So when you talk democracy to the Chinese, it is against this cultural backdrop. So what applied to the Qing
dynasty, the Ming dynasty, they have taken a step further recently in China. They introduced even more rules,
governing the circumstances under which you are disqualified from serving in the area near where you were
born. You can't stay in a ministry for too long, you can't stay in a department for too long beacuse if you stay
too long, you develop affiliations and those affiliations will result in sidedoors and guanxi and corruption. Of
course, many of these rules will still be breached, and there will be scandals from time to time and they will act
on those scandals. For as long as the central leadership is pristine, the system can be maintained. But one day
they will become corrupt, as in so many previous dynasties, and a downward spiral begins. And it is very
difficult in that situation to reverse it.
So I mentioned at the table that for India, it's not a country that can sustain a revolution, because its deep
structure would not allow for it. I think China is a country which can only be renewed through periodic
revolutions. Kishore asked me when- I said well maybe in 200 years time because these are long cycles and
they expect as a matter of course that the history of the People's Republic would not be written by the People's
Republic. It will be written by the next dynasty. Except that right now they say we shouldn't call it a dynasty,
we are now democrats, we are a republic, there is no Emperor...Well, whatever term you call it, it will be done
much later.
Let me now talk about their attitude towards religion. Being a Roman Catholic I follow quite closely the ups
and downs in their relationship with the Vatican and I find it quite fascinating. The Jesuits, when they went to
China in the Ming dynasty, hoped that they could convert the Emperor, and all of China would become Catholic
and a great mission would have been achieved. They never succeeded. Some of the brightest minds from
Europe went there. Matteo Ricci, he corrected the Chinese calendar, he repaired the clocks in the palace, he saw
the throne, but he never got to meet the Emperor and he died in China. And his tomb, it's in the compound of
the Beijing Party School today. And the church which he founded is still there today. 'Li Matou', that's what he
called himself, he applied for permission to be buried in China and he was given that permission. Then when
the Manchus swept southwards, in 1644, the missionaries thought now they had a chance, ""the Manchus will be
a bit more accomodating towards us, we will yet Christianise China"". So if you read the despatches of the
missionaries during that period, the Tartar Wars they described it, they were full of hope. But not a chance.
They appealed to the Second Emperor, Kangxi.
""Can we send more missionaries?"" ""No problem"". ""Can we have them all report to a papal legate in Beijing""
""No such thing"". The Emperor imposed one condition: ""you can send as many priests as you want to China but
they must die in China, they cannot leave after that"". You see, instinctively, the Chinese, when they see the
Catholic Church, they see someone like themselves, someone whose claim to its members is total. And for
whom that loyalty is a jealous one.
Mind you they do not try to control everything; they just control the big things, dogma, doctrine. After that you
are left on your own and you are financially independent, but on the big issue of who appoints ministers and
provincial secretaries, it's the same as the Pope appointing Bishops and Bishops ordaining Priests and governing
this vast empire, whether we're talking about the Chinese empire or the Catholic empire. They have about the
same number of members in the world which is why their interaction is a complex and difficult one. And over
the appointment of Bishops, both seek ultimate authority. In the end they have got to find a way to resolve it. I
can anticipate the Vatican's argument that ""we are not of this realm, we are of the other realm, so please we are
not in conflict"". As for the Chinese leaders, their attitude towards religion from the earliest days is to keep
religion at arm's length. Those who govern the empire, they are areligious, they can have private religions, but
in matters of their public conduct, they are Confucianist. In public, you are not a Catholic, you are not a
Muslim, you are not a Buddhist. When the Jesuits went to China, they were very impressed by this - that it was
possible to create a moral order based not on religion but on ethics. So impressed, that they wrote about it, and
influenced people like Voltaire and the other Encyclopedists. It helped inspire the Frence revolution- that you
could get rid of the Church, and still maintain a moral order in society.
I've talked about China and law, China and democracy, China and religion, now let me talk about China and
foreign policy which is perhaps your greatest interest; about which I can only talk about generally because you
are the experts in this field. I think it's very difficult for the Chinese to break from their old mindset that they are
[Zhong Guo], the Middle Kingdom, they are at the center of the Universe, then there are the other 'chopsticks
peoples' who are semi-Sinic. I think they consider Singapore to be semi-Sinic. Then there are those who are
beyond that realm, who are what the Greeks would have called Barbarians. The Mongols, the Manchus, the
Europeans, the Americans, the Indians and so on.
Now all that jargon of course is not in use today. They are very civilised, they will welcome you with great
hospitality - lavish dinners, very courteous words, offering you the best of everything in the house. It reminded
me of the way my mother used to teach us at home, we were a big family and the stranger has got to be treated
well, the visitor has to be treated well, because you are afraid of the visitor. So you always treat visitors better
than your own family members because the visitor is capricious, he can harm you so make sure you fit him in.
Those who are within your authority, you can always maintain order anyway. This is the way, in their minds,
the universe is ordered. So I can understand why the Koreans, the Japanese, the Vietnamese, to some extent, the
Singaporeans, they feel uncomfortable about what they see as a repetition of a pattern they have seen many
times before in the past. Will the Chinese change this principle of foreign policy, I think they have, because,
never in their history have they met, have they existed in close contact with competing centers of power, with
the US, with Europe, India, and you are no longer separated by oceans which cannot be crossed, mountains
which cannot be crossed, now they are connected. So they are making adjustments.
It will be interesting to watch how they handle their Olympics; if the Olympics become an exercise of pure
Chinese nationalism, I think the international reaction against China will be very severe. But I think the Chinese
will be sophisticated. I expect they will organise cheer teams for the Americans, for the Japanese, so that there
is an appearance of courtesy and common humanity. They are very careful to ensure that their words fit
conditions today.
But let me say in their defence that many of these methods they use arise out of fear, not out of a desire to
dominate. If you analyse the old tributary system, those who sent tributes got more than they gave in return. It
became a racket. So the Japanese merchants competed to get tokens from [Ryukyu] in order to be able to do the
China trade because it meant a lot of money. The Chinese are fearful of foreigners. They are fearful of the
Russians to the north, the Muslims to the West, the Indians across the Himalayas, but mostly the Americans
across the Pacific. Their strategy is to keep the temperature low, low profile, hide the shine of your armour, the
shine of your sword, just play the game and concentrate on economic development. Internally will they make
preparations? I have no doubt, because they have a deep fear. Is their intention to dominate, to conquer, the way
the European powers did in the past? I don't think so. I don't think there is a great desire to turn non-Chinese
into Chinese. Maybe Korea, maybe Vietnam, maybe Mongolia, who at various points in time were part of their
greater empire, they might consider worth civilising. But beyond that, Sinicising Indians, Russians? No, I don't
think they will want to do that. So as they now become stronger and more powerful, I believe that while their
old nature will re-assert itself, they will also be reacting to us. If they find the world a threatening place, they
will develop their own responses to those threats.
Quite early in the day, they wanted to neutralise Southeast Asia, Asean. It had never been an area which
threatened them, historically. So they didn't worry about Southeast Asia as a threat. But resources, sea lanes,
they go through Southeast Asia. And they made a dramatic move a few years ago. Zhu Rongji was here for the
ASEAN-China summit. He said, ""free trade agreement"". At that time when he announced it, the leaders of
ASEAN almost fell off their chairs. We thought of China an economic threat to us. Not as a partner. Took us
almost a year to digest the implications and to say yes, let's negotiate. Step by step. And all the time China was
assuring us that we would benefit more than they would benefit. When the Framework Agreement was signed
by Zhu Rongji in 2002 in Phonm Penh, he made two remarkable statements. He said if after 10 years, the
agreement benefits China more than it benefits Southeast Asia, let us renegotiate it. I can never imagine the
American USTR, or the European Trade Commissioner, talking like that. I mean in a contract, a deal is a deal,
it's settled for eternity. Then he said: ""China does not seek for itself an exclusive position in Southeast Asia"", so
he acknowledged that we were not just going to date one girl, we intended to be promiscuous from the
beginning. Towards Northeast Asia, I think it is very complicated, because there is so much history and legacy.
Towards Central Asia, towards Russia, they have deep fears. Towards America, it has become a relationship
bound together at so many points, a rupture would become more and more unthinkable. But it is going to be a
very difficult relationship, it will be the most important and most difficult relationship to manage in this
century. If it's badly managed there will be war, if it's properly managed there will be another generation of
peace and hundreds of millions of people in the world would be raised out of the depths of poverty. In this area,
you are the experts, but whenever I see China and watch its moves, I go back to its deep nature because it's not
easy for a country so vast, with such a sense of itself, to depart too much from its deep nature. Thank you.

The writer was not only a correspondent for The Guardian there but also apparently was on the Maldives delegation
putting him in various rooms. The accounts from the conference have been very fragmentary, the administration has
explained very little (for whatever reasons and to its detriment), and it is being widely blamed internationally. The broader
lesson I draw from Chinese disrespect for the president (and US) on his trip (I've heard accounts from journalists), its
behavior at Copenhagen, mercantalist economic policy (eg, currency), and its rough use of and contempt for international
organizations, not to mention the strange form of Chinese neo-colonialism in Africa, is the need for policy review. Fear of
Chinese retribution (economy. Iran, etc) can't be allowed to paralyze reassessment, though it should be factored into
scenarios. The Europeans are being damaged worse by Chinese economic policy than us and China policy is a new area
for the Western alliance to consult on. Leaving it to Treasury apparently parks policy in a laissez faire twilight zone.
Treasury has been as effective on China as it has been on AIG. Just thoughts of an observer.","['Maldives', 'US', 'Copenhagen', 'Africa', 'Iran', 'China', 'China']"

David Miliband: Labour is facing the fight of its life
Foreign secretary thought about quitting the government in last week's turmoil

Voters still don't know what Labour and Gordon Brown stand for, David Miliband admits today, as he reveals
how close he came to quitting the government during last week's turmoil at Westminster.
Speaking to the Guardian at the end of 10 extraordinary days, the foreign secretary says the party's high
command was given an ""electric shock"" by the disastrous European election results, and he urges fellow
ministers to get out and prepare for ""the fight of our life"".
But Miliband also concedes that he considered following his close friend and ally James Purnell, who resigned
from the government last week and called for the prime minister to stand down.
Miliband said: ""I'd made my decision on Thursday. Sometimes you can make your decisions with great
planning and calculation and sometimes you have to make them rather more quickly. James made his decision
in good faith, I made my decision in good faith ... we all have tolive with our decisions.""
The Labour party has a settled view of who should be leader, he said. ""This divides people who are close and
people feel passionately one way and people feel passionately the other way.""
Describing the task now facing Labour, he says: ""It could not be more urgent that there is a maximum of 11
months until the next general election, that we got 15% of the vote nationally [last week], that we came second
in Wales and that one in 20 people voted for us. If that does not electric shock us out of our ministerial chairs to
think: 'By God, we have got the fight of our life on our hands because whatever the Tories are they certainly
don't deserve a landslide' — then nothing will.""
Miliband has not given a domestic policy interview for nearly nine months since he felt dogged by accusations
that he was manoeuvring for the premiership. He refuses to acknowledge that his decision to back Brown last
week saved the prime minister, saying ""it is impossible to tell"".
But the foreign secretary feels his loyalty has given him the freedom to speak his mind without his motives
being questioned by anyone in Downing Street.
Miliband betrays frustration at the absence of a clear Labour vision, saying: ""We need the message to go out
that we have got the humility to learn about what has gone wrong.
""It is not a masochism strategy. It is about saying what we believe in. It is about clarity, priority, adding up to
purpose. I know what we stand for, I know what our instincts are, but the voters don't. Actually, I know what
Gordon Brown stands for.
""We have a responsibility to make sure that, come the election, [voters] know what Labour stands for. We were
not being listened to, people felt that they had been forgotten, we neither inspired nor reassured.""
He calls for cabinet colleagues to show stronger leadership in the battle to restore Labour's fortunes. ""We need
to make sure the talents and energies of not just the whole of the cabinet, but the whole of the labour movement
are give n free rein because one in 20 people voted for us. The truth is that we are not automatons. We all have
to get out there.""
Asked whether he felt voters had stopped listening to Brown, Miliband said: ""He himself has said he has to
build on his strengths and work on his weaknesses. That is a good maxim for all of us. He is someone who
made the right decisions on the biggest issue of the day. We have got a chance to fight with honour and dignity
for what we believe in. The stakes are very high because we know that parties can slump into very dangerous
positions.""
Providing what he describes as a route map from the disaster, he said: ""Labour first needs a period of
competent, effective, stable government; secondly, we need to reset our political compass so ministers are no
longer locked in their departments, but link their policies to their values; and thirdly, the government has to be
at the cutting edge of policy.""
On the issue of political reform, he demands a speeding-up of the pace of political reform, saying it is not a
piece of middle-class frippery. For the first time, he reveals that he now backs the Alternative Vote for the
Commons, saying MPs' legitimacy will be strengthened by being able to say 50% in my constituency voted for
me.
He says the change cannot be made before the general election. He also backs a fresh push on Lords reform,
saying ""we have got an agreed blueprint"".
He rounded on Tory spending plans, but said Labour would clarify its own intentions before the election. ""They
will be credible and clear. We will come to that in an open and honest way.""
But he defends delay in setting out these figures, arguing ""when you are in the middle of a Tornado it is a bad
time take a forecast"".
In an oblique reference to the Damian McBride briefings, he also calls on the media to abandon unattributable
briefings, saying all politicians' spokesmen should be named, or not quoted by media outlets. ""The gotcha
culture of politics is not in anyone's interests,"" he said.

that the ballots were never counted or were.abandoned after it was clear Ahmadinejad was going to lose. Statistically, it
is impossible to maintain such a perfect linear relationship consistently through all stages of vote counting. We would
expect variation as the votes were coming in, due to differences expected between the cites and the country side and

Points:
- We condemn the effort to remove Zelaya from office.
- We are working within the OAS and with our regional partners to resolve this situation quickly and in a manner that
restores democratic order.
°- We appreciate the role Spain played in winning quick EU condemnation of the coup attempt.
- Our work is not done. Rebuilding trust among competing political institutions and reducing polarization within
Honduras will take a lot of work. We hope Spain will work with us and the OAS to ensure a restoration of democratic
order that will allow Honduras to carry through with it electoral timetable (presidential vote scheduled for November)
Note from torn:
Aside from the statements issued by the President and the Secretary, we have been working in the OAS Permanent
Council fashioning a consensus resolution mapping out a path forward, reaching out to regional partners ( I have spoken
twice with Salvadoran President Funes, and our Ambassadors have been working with other Central American leaders),
and working within Honduras to limit the damage to Honduras institutions.

Clinton Ends Africa Tour, Vowing to Stay Involved By JEFFREY GETTLEMAN The New York Times
Published: August 15, 2009
SANTA MARIA, Cape Verde - After a grueling seven-nation, 11-day trip, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton
wrapped up her Africa tour on Friday by reaffirming her promise to renovate American relations with the continent.
""I leave Africa after this remarkable trip even more committed,"" Mrs. Clinton said before leaving Cape Verde.
""I have seen the joy and energy Africans have, evidenced not just by the boogieing, but by the hard work and
perseverance,"" she said, referring to a recent comment from her husband, former President Bill Clinton, that she knew
how to ""boogie"" with African dancers.
""And we've seen the worst humanity can do to itself,"" she added, presumably referring to Congo, where Mrs. Clinton
met victims of a brutal civil war that just does not seem to end.
Mrs. Clinton seemed satisfied that she had accomplished her mission: strengthening American relations with crucial
allies on the continent, like Nigeria and South Africa, and sending a message of ""tough love,"" as she called it, to nations
like Kenya and Congo.
Over all, she said, the United States wants to work more closely with African nations as a partner, not simply as a patron
or dispenser of aid. In exchange, she said, African leaders must deliver democracy and good government.
Mrs. Clinton vowed to stay on top of Africa, even after she gets back to Washington, closely monitoring the issues she
addressed on her tour. She also pointed to Cape Verde, a set of palm-studded islands best known for their beaches and
enormous tourist hotels, as an example of what good leadership can do.
""This is possible,"" she said. ""You create not just economic growth but a sense of human dignity and possibility.""
Kenya. South Africa. Angola. Congo. Nigeria. Liberia. And finally Cape Verde. Mrs. Clinton saw with her own eyes some of
Africa's most promising countries - and some of its most troubled ones. In Kenya, she pushed for the government to
prosecute perpetrators of the postelection violence last year. In South Africa, the big issue was Zimbabwe and how the
South African government should do more to help ease the crisis there.
In Angola, the theme was good governing practices and oil, a strategic concern of the United States given the many
inroads China has made there and elsewhere in Africa in its hunger for natural resources. In Congo, Mrs. Clinton was
passionate about the need to end the nation's rape epidemic.
""The secretary's visit to the heart of the world's deadliest war zone in eastern Congo was a potential game-changer for
that conflict,"" said John Prendergast, a founder of the Washington-based Enough project. ""Her commitment to
addressing root causes such as the conflict minerals that power our electronics industry was a refreshing contrast to the
usual disaster sympathy tourism of visiting dignitaries.""
""Now,"" he added, ""comes the hard part: making good on the promises and living up to the high expectations
engendered by her visit.""
In Nigeria, Mrs. Clinton pressed for electoral changes. In Liberia, she praised the country's president, Ellen Johnson
Sirleaf, the only woman in Africa to be elected head of state.
The Liberian visit had a special warmth, almost like a meeting of long-lost cousins. Liberia was founded in the 19th
century by freed American slaves, and the country's flag, the people's names and even the police uniforms with plastic-
brimmed hats were all reminiscent of the American versions. Mrs. Clinton received possibly her most exuberant
welcome there, and a Liberian man with a long wooden horn followed her around most of the visit, blowing out loud
funny noises whenever she said something striking.
""I love that - the horn - I want to take that guy with me wherever I go,"" she said.
In Cape Verde, Mrs. Clinton seemed to have few bones to pick. For once, she said, she had a cheat sheet on a country
that included a list of far more positives than negatives. The country has fewer than 500,000 people and has escaped the
turmoil that has engulfed so much of Africa. The all-inclusive, poolside buffet resorts here feel like something found in
CanctIn or the Bahamas.
Mrs. Clinton called Cape Verde ""a model of democracy and economic progress in Africa.""
On Friday, just as she had at every stop, she started her speech by saying, ""I bring you greetings from President Obama.""
She called him a ""son of Africa"" and said that under the Obama administration, the United States was determined to
help Africa reach its promise.

She painted a very positive portrait of the trip, and said that nothing knocked you off stride, you staved focused.
I'm just reading the clips now and the wrap up pieces are uniformly terrific. Might have been unorthodox, but you
certainly raised the awareness in the US about Africa. The debate over the legitimacy of covering your town hall
remarks all come with a heavy dose of the depravity occurring there. So there's a silver lining as people talk about

Congratulations on the speech. I think it came out great. And the reaction I have heard today has been very
positive.
Let raise an idea about how you could present the arrangement on settlements that you are seeking with Israel as
I understand it, i.e. a moratorium coupled with allowances to complete a number of housing units. There are
two ways:
1. To describe it as an agreement, explaining why the US has accepted an Israeli completion of a
handful of units whose construction already has begun. This raises some concerns. It would
represent U.S. legitimization of some (however small) Israeli activity in the West Bank and it
would trigger Arab and Palestinian complaints that we had compromised, sowing doubts about
our effectiveness.
2. The alternative would be for the administration to say:
a. We have come a very long way, as Israel has made unprecedented commitments to the U.S. in terms of a
settlements freeze. This is a very welcome development.
b. We did not achieve all that we had hoped as Israel intends to complete a number of
housing units. We have differences with the Israeli government on this matter which we
have expressed to them..
•c. That said, we are convinced that substantial progress has been made that warrants
an immediate resumption of peace talks as well as Arab steps toward Israel that will help
promote a two-state solution.
This latter option retains our credibility, does not compromise our oft-stated position and allows us to move
forward.
Of course, I am around if you want to discuss.
Good luck in India. They are very excited about your visit.

Fyi",[]
2471,"Palau release on free association meetingBelow is Palau's statement on the recent meeting in the required free association review. The fourth is the key
paragraph. Jake, I'll call. Jeff 202-343-2905 o,
A Compact of Free Association replaced the United States administration of Palau, islands which the U.S. took in war and
subsequently administered for the United Nations. The Compact, which was signed in 1986 and took effect October 1,
1994, includes provisions of various duration. Some are to last at least 50 years, including full U.S. military authority --
although the power of the U.S. to deny access to Palau and its extensive waters by the military of any other nation is to
continue in perpetuity.
The amounts and types of U.S. budgetary and programmatic assistance to Palau under the Compact are specified for 15
years, but the Compact requires reviews of its terms and the entire relationship on its 15th, 30th, and
40th anniversaries. The reviews are to consider the operating requirements of the Government of Palau and the islands'
development. The Compact also commits the U.S. to acting on the findings and to promoting Palau's long-term economic
development.
A Palauan delegation that included Vice President Kerai Mariur, Chief Representative for Compact Review Joshua
Koshiba, Minister of Health Dr. Stevenson J. Kuartei, Palau Community College President Dr. Patrick Tellei, Ambassador
to the U.S. Hersey Kyota, Representative to the United Nations Stuart Beck, and their consultants met in Honolulu on July
8-9 in connection with the 15th Anniversary Review with an American delegation that included Department of State Office
of Australia, New Zealand, and Pacific Islands Affairs Alcy Frelick, the head of the US Delegation, and representatives of
the Departments of the Interior and Defense and the Weather and Postal Services.
The U.S. delegation made positive statements on a few matters and agreed to discuss some others further. A number of
the U.S. delegation's statements, however, evidenced a need for greater study by some U.S. officials of the intent as well
as the letter of the Compact, the relationship as a whole, Palau's economic situation and fiscal responsibility
commitments, and Palau's contributions to the U.S. and to international harmony -- including sacrifice by Palauans in the
U.S. military, the UN international peacekeeping force and Palau's strategic location and posture, and Palau's positions in
the U.N.
Palau is grateful for its partnership with the U.S. and wants to continue in the association as called for by the Compact,
deepen the relationship, and develop its capacities as a freely associated state. It appreciates the more positive
expressions of U.S. Secretaries of State Clinton and of the Interior Salazar and congressional leaders of both political
parties. Palau fully trusts that reflection will result in an approach to the relationship consistent with the Compact and to
positions befitting the great nation that is the United States.
Recognizing that the questions of the association are relatively small and unique for the Government of the U.S. and that
the U.S. faces many and extraordinary challenges at this time, Palau understands why more deliberation by U.S. officials
can be needed.
Because of this, because of the confidence that it has in the United States, and because it would not be productive to
elaborate with others on the conversations at this stage, Palau's representatives are confining additional comment to
official communications.

The Secretary's Call Sheet for
Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari
Purpose of Call: To express your condolences regarding the deaths of Iraqi MFA personnel in the August 19 attack on
the Iraqi Foreign Ministry.
MI want to personally express my heartfelt condolences to you for the savage attack on the Iraqi Ministry of Foreign
Affairs today and for the tragic loss of so many Iraqi lives around Baghdad and particularly at the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs.
al I remember fondly our meeting at the MFA in April — I was proud to be the first senior U.S. official to attend a meeting
there, and I was deeply saddened to hear that your Ministry was attacked.
DI This is a trying day for Iraqis and the Government of Iraq, but brutal attacks like these only deepen the need for
dedicated Iraqi like you and those in your Ministry, to remain committed to the new Iraq.
1:11 Know that the United States will continue to stand by Iraq as it faces these challenges.
Background: On Wednesday, August 19, what appears to be a series of VBIED and additional rocket attacks in Baghdad
resulted in the bloodiest day in Baghdad since the June 30 withdrawal of U.S. forces from urban areas. Although exact
numbers have not been confirmed, media is reporting that approximately 75 people were killed across Baghdad with
over 100 injuries. The most devastating attack appears to have been against the Iraqi MFA, where a VBIED was
exploded in front of the main gate. Zebari's Chief of Staff estimated that there were 35-40 fatalities and up to 40
injuries resulting from this attack, with 70% of the building damaged. In April, you were the first senior U.S. official to
hold a meeting at the MFA. Deputy Foreign Minister Labid Abbawi, who attended your meeting at the MFA and who's
wife led your meeting with Iraqi war widows, was reportedly slightly injured and quite shaken by the attack. He may
have lost a number of staff members. At this point, we do not know if other senior-ranking MFA officials were killed or
wounded in the attack.","['Baghdad', 'U.S.', 'Iraq', 'Iraq', 'United', 'States', 'Iraq', 'Baghdad', 'Baghdad', 'U.S.', 'Baghdad', 'U.S.']"

By KWANG-TAE KIM
Associated Press
Sat Jul 25, 4:51 am ET
SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea has indicated its interest in holding direct talks with the United States, a news report
said, after the two sides traded barbs over Pyongyang's nuclear weapons programs at a security forum. ""We are not
against a dialogue. We are not against any negotiation for the issues of common concern,"" Japan's Kyodo news agency
quoted North Korean ambassador to the United Nations Sin Son Ho as saying Friday. But the ambassador, speaking in
New York, dismissed the possibility of a return to stalled nuclear negotiations involving the two Koreas, the U.S., Japan,
China and Russia, saying ""the six-party talks are gone forever."" The U.S. has offered to hold talks with the North within
the six-nation process if it returns to the negotiating table and takes irreversible steps for denuclearization. Last
weekend, Assistant U.S. Secretary of State Kurt Campbell indicated that the chances for direct talks between North
Korea and the U.S. were slim. ""Our bilateral negotiations are between the U.S. and South Korea about our collective
approach"" to the North, Campbell told reporters in Seoul. Sin said the five other parties to the nuclear talks ""cheated""
North Korea, accusing them of not implementing what they had agreed under a disarmament-for-aid deal. No more
details were given in the Kyodo report. Sin was not available for comment Saturday. The North Korean mission to the
U.N. declined to comment. North Korea quit the nuclear talks in April to protest a U.N. statement condemning a rocket
launch. North Korea insisted it sent a satellite into orbit, while the U.S. and its allies said it was actually a long-range
missile test. North Korea conducted its second nuclear test in May and a barrage of missile tests in July, drawing
international condemnation and new U.N. sanctions. U.S. and Chinese officials are expected to discuss North Korea's
nuclear programs and other regional security issues at a strategic dialogue next week in Washington. ""North Korea will
be a significant topic, but obviously one among many,"" State Department spokesman Philip Crowley said Friday in
Washington. The U.S. and North Korea engaged in a sharp war of words earlier this week over U.S. Secretary of State
Hillary Rodham Clinton's recent comment likening the regime in Pyongyang to ""small children"" demanding attention. At
a regional security conference in Thailand, Clinton also said the North ""has no friends left."" North Korea's Foreign
Ministry described her Thursday as ""a funny lady"" who sometimes ""looks like a primary schoolgirl and sometimes a
pensioner going shopping.""

Per the VoA pronunciation guide: ab-YAY (Ops). The FY09 base level for Sudan assistance programs is $327m vs $403m
in FY10- mostly related to infrastructure and election/referendum requirements. This does NOT include several hundred

different. First, people across the spectrum - DC insiders, reporters, staff, ex-staff, friends of friends, WH folks, etc -
were blown away. Second, people were REALLY moved by the last segment, three people even told me they teared up.
I'm guessing and hoping you hear this directly from random folks in the coming days.
And I think because it's been a lousy couple of weeks for the Admin, with mixed messages and bad news, coupled with
many people seeing you for the first time for an extended period talking about the job and your relationship with the
President, and that combo was probably the most powerful reminder since your speech in Denver that you're in a class
all your own (including the President who became enmeshed in the Gates incident)
That you didn't wait for the envoy question was key, you turned it into a strength. What you said about the President
and how you said it, one can't help but think how much of a team player you are and how remarkably you've adapted to
the role.
You were definitely on your game. You either threw a perfect game - or at least a no hitter. So this couldn't have gone
better, achieved everything we needed to times 10, and comes on the heels of a great 10 days.

Secretary Clinton —
I understand you are going to Kenya next week and while I know the trip is primarily focused on trade issues, I
wanted to flag an issue for you because I know it is near and dear to your heart.
Kenya has one of the strictest anti-abortion laws in Africa — it is illegal unless a woman's life is at risk and
criminalizes both the woman and the provider. Two years ago, Kenyan authorities imprisoned a doctor and
two nurses, falsely accusing them of providing illegal abortions. After a year in prison, the providers were
found innocent and released, but it galvanized the legal and provider community who formed a coalition to
make abortion less restrictive. It will come as no surprise to you that, as a result of their abortion law, Kenya
has one of the highest maternal mortality rates in all of Africa, with an estimated 800 women a day seeking
the procedure, often through dangerous means.
Kenya is restarting a long-stalled constitutional review process and they hope to produce a final Constitution
by next year. Religious groups are on a concerted crusade to include new language in the Constitution which
would codify that ""life begins at conception"". The current Constitution is largely silent on the issue. If this fetal
personhood amendment goes forward, it would place Kenya in the small community of nations with such a
provision. It would clearly mark Kenya as out of stop with countries attempting to institutionalize the African
Union's Maputo Protocol, one of the most progressive regional documents on women, development and
reproductive rights, and with the vast majority of African countries in general. For a country trying to regain
the momentum of stability and success it enjoyed until recently, such a policy imposition would be a
regression for women's rights and for the country writ large.
I went to Kenya last month to work with the coalition that has formed to strategize against the Constitutional
amendment and to work toward a less restrictive abortion law. I also visited several of our clinics and
providers in Nairobi and in nearby villages where Planned Parenthood has programs to train providers in post
abortion care. You have seen this a million times in your travels around the world, so I don't need to tell you
how poignant the stories were of the lives saved and lost, the bravery in standing up to constant government
harassment, and the fear of what this potential Constitutional amendment will mean to the provision of safe
medical services. I know it is asking a lot, but if there is any way that you could draw attention to this issue
when you are in Kenya, you would be even more of my personal hero than you already are. It is our hope that
if Kenya knows the world is watching they may be more careful in how they proceed. Of course we would be
happy to help you in any way if you decide you want to do something on this while you are there. There is also
a Congressional delegation going to Kenya the week of August 8th and we are working on them to have a side
meeting on this issue as well.
As always, thank you so much for all you do. We are all so grateful that you are there! All best, Laurie

Werner
GFC
To whom it may concern from experience speaking!
RSO Niall,
Please be aware and as you have requested my elaboration in written format. As briefly
discussed in the meeting today, the LGF operate at what I would consider the ""Threshold'
Sleep Deprivation. Further meaning, that our work schedule, hours and sleeping pattern'
the LGF very close to the edge of serious sleep deprivation. When we have to work go.,
,
time or ramp up extra manpower (during scheduled off days) due to increased threw .
etc...etc...; we further compound the issue of sleep deprivation. This ultimately dirninit,:
LGF's ability to provide security.
To better explain, here is where it starts, the LGF work 3 days then transition (swing shift) into .
nights then transition into 3 days off (it used to be 2x2x2). Each work day equals 14 actin I I!(-)
of work; Supervisor's can average up to 15 hours per work day.
Snap shot of an average day for a shift:
1. 05:00hrs every day, Shift Brief for on-going shift, along with ""In-Service Training"". .I
Convoy Brief, followed by convoy load time and organization for entire shift (approx i
during the day) followed by actual convoy movement.
2. 05:45 to 06:15hrs. (approximately) you have the shift change over on site,
3. 06:15 to 17:45, regular work day on site.
4. 17:45 to 18:15, Shift change over, followed by reorganization of convoy for off-going. slii
then actual convoy movement
5. 18:30 (approximately) Off-going shift returns to Camp Sullivan, weapons and equipment are
down loaded and convoy equipment is stowed, vehicle's re-staged in parking lot.
6. 19:00 (approximately) Off-going shift is complete, all equipment is accounted for and
secured, they are then on personnel time whether to work out and train, eat dinner, watch
movie, internet, phone calls, sleep or etc.
7. 10 hours later, it starts all over with a 05:00hrs Shift Brief not taking into considers tit
wake-up and grooming and breakfast.
This averages an actual 14 hour day for each LGF member. Some days can be as short a,
hours and some days as long as 14.5 hours. Supervisor's can average an additional
(approximate) 30 minutes prior to and after a shift conducting administrative duties and or ,;1
organization. All personal hygiene, laundry, personal e-mail/matters, Physical fitness, usually
meals and sleep must be conducted within the 10 hour window between an individual's shifts.
After completing the 3 days in a work cycle which ends at 19:00hrs, the shifts swings into
night shift schedule. Their next duty starts at 17:00hrs the following day for the evening
briefmg. This is a 22 hour transition window which most LGF only sleep once and are
again with the same 14 hour schedule for their first night shift. This can be viewed as gea i
one good sleep in for a 36 hours window of time (by the end of their first night shift, fol
two more night shifts).
When finishing their last night shift, they are immediately off, however, do to working ah
(arriving back at Camp Sullivan around 06:30) they sleep most of the first day off. They the
have to adjust back into a night-time sleeping pattern. The second day off is a designated
training day. Third day is a scheduled off day.
If you average this work schedule out over the course of a month, an LGF member transitio',
from a day to night sleeping pattern on average of 7 times. It's nearly impossible to establish
rhythmic sleeping pattern. This is what causes the sleep deprivation. You can see its efftiek
over the course of time. When a shift gets back on ground after an R&R, they are fresh and rt,
of energy, as compared to a shift that is been in the grind for 7 or 8 weeks and sometint,:..
after 5 and 6 weeks.
In summary, a disruption or addition to the current work schedule further compounds t1.
sleep deprivation and is not sustainable by the LGF for extended periods of time.

Here is what we have come up with as agreed language from Bob, Eric, Mike, Melanne, Lissa and me. This can be used
for the letter and for press guidance. Melanne will send a letter to the GOSL and perhaps the UN Permrep. We will ask
the Post to release the letter to journalists in Colombo once it is received. I will schedule a press briefing at the Foreign
Press Center early this week, which will attract a good number of Asian journalists, and make sure the question is asked
so we can put it in proper context. We will have it for guidance in the Main State briefing if asked. PJ
BEGIN TEXT
Questions have been raised regarding remarks by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on September 30 before the United
Nations Security Council on the adoption of a resolution to combat sexual violence in armed conflict. In her statement,
she said that we have seen rape used as a tactic before in a number of countries, including Sri Lanka.
Regarding the Secretary's reference to Sri Lanka in her address, we want to be clear. Over the course of the difficult
conflict between the government of Sri Lanka and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), stretching into this
decade, the State Department as well as credible human rights organizations reported numerous cases of rape and
sexual violence in Sri Lanka, particularly acts committed against women held in detention by the government. This was
the basis for the Secretary's statement. At the same time, in the most recent phase of the conflict, from 2006 to 2009,
though we remained deeply concerned about reports of extrajudicial killings, disappearances and mistreatment of
detainees, we have not received reports that rape and sexual abuse were used as tools of war, as they clearly have in
other conflict areas around the world. We hope that this clarification puts the issue in its proper context.
These questions should not detract from the specific actions that Sri Lanka needs to take now. With the end of the
military conflict, Secretary Clinton believes strongly that Sri Lanka must focus to the future and move forward on the
promotion of peace and the protection of human rights. The government of Sri Lanka should release more than 250,000
displaced persons who are still confined in camps, and lead a process of genuine political and social reconciliation. The
United States stands ready to assist and support the people of Sri Lanka with these critical challenges.","['Colombo', 'Sri', 'Lanka', 'Sri', 'Lanka', 'Sri', 'Lanka', 'Sri', 'Lanka', 'Sri', 'Lanka', 'Sri', 'Lanka', 'Sri', 'Lanka', 'United', 'States', 'Sri', 'Lanka']"

public rift within the international community here. The senior American official at the U.N. mission, Peter W.
Galbraith, left the country abruptly Sunday in a dispute with the mission director, Norwegian Kai Eide.
""Galbraith had pushed for an exhaustive probe. Sources who are familiar with the dispute but are not authorized
to. speak on the record said Eide argued that the international community should not press too hard because it
could undermine national stability.
Galbraith had been convinced that Karzai could not win without fraud and had tried to reduce the number of
polling stations in some areas in the south, the incumbent's ethnic stronghold, said one diplomatic source. Eide
and others, the source said, were convinced that Karzai would win in any case and that any irregularities could
be smoothed over, as they were in the 2004 presidential election that Karzai won by a safe margin.""

Pulitzer Prize-Winning Novelist and Essayist
Posted: September 17, 2009 02:56 PM
HuffPost Book Review: Republican Gomorrah
About twenty years ago, I read an article about a death row inmate who had shot a clerk in a convenience store.
The way the murder was presented by the man on death row was mysterious--his hand just rose up and the gun
went off. Shooting the clerk in the face in the midst of a robbery wasn't in fact his fault. He never said, ""I shot a
man."" It just happened.
I thought of that man while reading Max Blumenthal's terrific, but also, of course, appalling new book,
Republican Gomorrah. Apparently there isn't a single person in the present incarnation of the Republican party
who does anything. Things happen--God does it. Satan does it. No Republican is an agent of his or her own
success or failure, sin or redemption. It just happens.
The consequences of this lack of responsibility are there for all to see--screaming threats, guns at rallies,
unhinged behavior every time a Republican doesn't feel the way he or she wants to feel, absolute sense of
powerlessness leading directly to an absolute will to power. Because that was the thing that struck me about the
murderer in the 7-11--he had the power and in his own last moments, the clerk knew it. But the killer, no matter
how well armed, never felt it.
Republican Gomorrah is a frightening book because it is clear to all of us on the outside that the various
Republican operatives who surround James Dobson and his ilk have no consciences and will stop at nothing.
They invoke the name of God for purposes that shame God absolutely--hurting, destroying, maiming, and
damning others who either don't accept their beliefs or don't acknowledge their power and righteousness. Of
course that is frightening.
But Blumenthal's cast of characters, beginning with Dobson and his prodigal son, Ryan, and including John
Hagee, Sarah Palin, Ralph Reed, Charles Colson, Judith Reisman, Christina Regnery, Donald Wildmon, et al.
strike the reader as above all else very small--egocentric, narrow minded, uneducated, selfish, and resentful.
Each of these qualities is destructive in and of itself The combination is turning out to be coercive. Even those
of us who are immune to the emotions these people play upon are getting more and more nervous about the
power that they wish to exert.
Blumenthal does two things that no one else I have read manages to do--the first of these is that he organizes the
network. He shows how Ted Bundy is connected to James Dobson is connected to Gary Bauer is connected to
Erik Prince is connected to Ralph Reed is connected to Jack Abramoff is connected to Tom Delay is connected
to Tony Perkins is connected to David Duke is connected to Mel Gibson, and so forth, and in the course of
tracing these connections, he informs us, or reminds us, of the crimes and misdemeanors these people have
committed.
Two of my favorites are James Dobson's son Ryan's messy divorce (Dad seems to have paid the settlement--did
he not dare to discipline? Or did he discipline too much?) and David Vitter's habitual recourse to a brothel in
New Orleans where Republicans ""wanted to be spanked and tortured and wear stockings--Republicans have
impeccable taste in silk stockings"" (the madam is talking about men). Republican Gomorrah is full of crimes--
both those we've already heard of, such as Abramoffs and Ted Haggard's, and those we haven't (there is good
evidence that Texas billionaire T. Cullen Davis, funder of the right wing Council For National Policy, ordered
hits on his estranged wife, and succeeded in murdering his step-daughter and the wife's boyfriend).
This aspect of the book reminds me of a Scottish novel called The Private Memoirs And Confessions Of A
Justified Sinner by James Hogg, in which, once a man believes he is among the saved, he can commit any sin he
wants to and be sure he will go to heaven. Once Davis was ""saved,"" for example, he said, ""My goal is to get to
heaven. I'll do anything it takes to get there, and I'm not going to let anything stand in my way."" He must have
thought getting to heaven was just another power play.
And power plays are the key to right wing psychology. Right wing psychology is the other thing that
Blumenthal has to offer. At the periphery of this world is your run-of-the-mill bully, a man like Jack Abramoff,
whose brutality is well remembered by his high school classmates, but who sang like a bird once he was caught.
At the center of is James Dobson, a much more destructive figure than Abramoff, who advocates, in the
strongest terms, child beating, and not only child-beating, but dog-beating. At one point he brags about going
after the family canine (who weighed twelve pounds) and engaging in ""the most vicious fight ever staged
between man and beast."" As for children, the goal is to keep beating the child until ""he wants(s) to crumple on
the breast of his parent."" In other words, Dobson is a proud sadist who thinks sadism is kind of funny, and who,
over the years, has successfully advocated sadism as the only workable form of child-rearing.
It order to understand the deeply disturbing effect Dobson and his theories have had on our culture, Blumenthal
cites Erich Fromm's Escape from Freedom, about the psychology of Nazism and authoritarianism, and Eric
Hoffer's The True Believer. Insofar as he finds the documentation, Blumenthal points out how many of these
powerful Evangelical Christians were beaten and abused as children (including Dobson). It's a high number.
The beatings, often arbitrary, cruel, and frequent, were then, in many cases, backed up with constant lessons
about God--that he is arbitrary, that he is cruel, that he demands obedience above all things, and that he
surpasseth understanding. The point of these exercises is to establish the powerlessness of the child, his shame
and guilt as a worthless sinner, and his absolute fear of thinking for himself He will then take his place in the
hierarchy and thereby reinforce the existence of the hierarchy.
Blumenthal goes pretty far with this psychology, but, in my view, not far enough. I'm sure he was reared by
liberal parents, who gave him a sense of responsibility, curiosity, and autonomy, and since he is only in his
thirties, I don't think that he really empathizes with the tortured and damaged souls that he has been
interviewing and watching for the last few years. I don't think he understands their fear--how deep it is, how
constant it is, and how arousing it is. I don't think, in fact, that Max Blumenthal looks within and sees evil. I
think he looks within, and says, ""I'm okay; you're okay."" That's the goal of liberal parenting, and as we can tell
by statistics he cites concerning unwed pregnancy, divorce, and occurrence of STDs, liberal parenting works--
atheists and agnostics, for example, have a much lower rate of divorce than Evangelicals, and states that have
sex education in the schools, rather than abstinence-only education, have lower rates of teen pregnancy.
But a child who is beaten enough eventually comes to understand two things above all--that the world makes no
sense (and so why try to make sense of it?) and that the world is so dangerous that to be oneself, or even to try
to figure out what oneself might be, is a death-defying exercise. There is safety only in two things--conforming
to a group and, as a part of that group, dominating and even destroying other groups. The rules of the group can
be anything at all, as long as the members of the group abide by them. And other groups have to abide by them,
too, or the painful and arbitrary rules that group abides by are meaningless. The beaten child's sense of terror
can only be assuaged by evanescent feelings of power, because in relation to his parents and to God, he is
defined as powerless. When he ""crumples"" on the ""loving"" breast of his parent (and in my view a person who
administers a beating to a living being who is 1/16th his size doesn't know what love is) he accepts his
powerlessness and he also accepts that power is what defines this life.
That's where your freedom and mine come in.
Many of the Evangelicals Blumenthal discusses are Christian Dominionists--that is, they differ from the Taliban
only in their choice of doctrine. Their uses of that doctrine (to dehumanize women and other groups, to never
share power, to control every aspect of every life within their power, and to create society as a steeply
hierarchical structure with them at the top) are those of the Taliban.
It's an eye-opener to read about R.J. Rushdoony, son of Armenian immigrants who fled the Armenian genocide
of 1915. You would think that a man whose family escaped mass murder would go on to espouse peace, love,
and understanding, but Rushdoony went the other way, taking literally the 613 laws in the Book of Leviticus. In
his book, The Institutes of Biblical Law, he advocates capital punishment for ""disobedient children, unchaste
women, apostates, blasphemers, practitioners of witchcraft, adulterers,"" and homosexuals. Gary North, the
Presbyterian Christian Reconstructionist, is his son-in-law, and, while not backing down on the mass death
penalty, advocates stoning rather than burning at the stake, because stoning is cheaper (and of course that is a
factor, because there would be a lot of people to exterminate). As for who would be doing the killing (of you
and me, if they could catch us), well, Christians would, but not because they wanted to. Ever unable to accept
responsibility, they assign agency to God, who wants us killed, who will beat us until we ""crumple"" on his
""loving"" breast, a God who has given us all sorts of talents, skills, and interests, but is, like these Christian
Dominionists, interested only in power. I believe his motto is ""Adore me or I will hurt you.""
Can you believe in a God so small? When I was a parent of young children, I, too, got frustrated, and I, too,
thought a spanking might be a good thing. I soon realized that my motives for administering physical
punishment were highly suspect--more anger and frustration than care for the child or knowledge about
effective methods. I then saw a show about child-rearing, in which a woman who firmly believed in child-
between man and beast."" As for children, the goal is to keep beating the child until ""he wants(s) to crumple on
the breast of his parent."" In other words, Dobson is a proud sadist who thinks sadism is kind of funny, and who,
over the years, has successfully advocated sadism as the only workable form of child-rearing.

""loving"" breast, a God who has given us all sorts of talents, skills, and interests, but is, like these Christian
Dominionists, interested only in power. I believe his motto is ""Adore me or I will hurt you.""
Can you believe in a God so small? When I was a parent of young children, I, too, got frustrated, and I, too,
thought a spanking might be a good thing. I soon realized that my motives for administering physical
punishment were highly suspect--more anger and frustration than care for the child or knowledge about
effective methods. I then saw a show about child-rearing, in which a woman who firmly believed in child-
beating aroused far more resistance in her beaten daughter, and had much more family disruption, than the
parents who ignored the tantrum and then used the technique of redirection to train their toddlers. Works with
horses, dogs, and other animals, too. It was then I decided that if I, in my human weakness, could put two and
two together concerning free will and proper behavior, surely God could, also. I didn't want to believe in a God
who was a smaller being than myself. And I don't.
The ray of hope in Blumenthal's book is that the right-wingers he talks about tend to be so psychologically
unstable that they don't have much staying power--think Ted Haggard. But they have numbers. The bad thing
about that is that they could take control. The defeat of Sarah Palin, Conrad Burns (R-MT), George Allen (R-
VA), Rick Santorum (R-PA), James Talent (R-MO), and Mike DeWine (R-OH) brought us ""back from the
brink"" according to the website Theocracy Watch. But only back from the brink. The good thing is that they
would not be able to maintain what we call a government for very long (see George W. Bush). The bad thing is
that they would destroy the country as we know it while they were trying. If I take the long view, well, I think,
Stalinism lasted about 25 years, Nazism 12. The Iranian Mullahs have been at it for 30 years. Russia and
Germany survived, Iran might, as well. But generations were lost in all these places. And Stalin and Hitler
didn't have nuclear weapons.
I think about the 22-year-old clerk in that convenience store, looking down the barrel of that pistol. He probably
had no idea that his killer had no sense of agency, hardly even knew what he was doing, was seeing his hand as
separate from himself. But I have to feel sorry for the killer, too, subject to feelings that he could not label that
were terrifying and overpowering. I bet he was beaten, shamed, and neglected as a child. I bet, afterward, he
wished someone, somehow, had stopped him.

HRC: I wasn't satisfied by my answer to your question about how to gain leverage over the
Pakistanis to move them to more aggressively pursue AQ. I've thought about it some more and,
while I have no silver bullet, here are some further thoughts.
-- My impression is that the Pakistanis have been more cooperative lately in assisting us target some
AQ in Pakistan and that, where they hold back, it is less a function of affinity toward AQ and more
about with whom AQ is imbedded..
-- In particular, they seem to be more reluctant to target AQ where it is nestled with groups they want
to cultivate in the event we ""leave"" Afghanistan and they need influence there. They have seen that
before and will hedge their bets.
-- So the first point is that we have to address the reason why they are holding back. If we can
disabuse them of the perception that we are leaving Afghanistan, it will be easier to get the Pakistanis
to go after AQ in sanctuaries provided by groups which would be part of a future Afghanistan
dominated by the Taliban.
-- Second, I believe that coercive measures are more likely to be effective if they are targeted against
military leaders who give support to AQ and its allies. Assuming we have adequate intelligence, we
can go after bank accounts, travel and other reachable assets of individual Pakistani officers, raising
the stakes for those supporting the militants without creating an inordinate backlash . Blunter
measures of coercion, like conditioning our assistance, are more likely to be counterproductive. Given
the level of distrust for us among the Pakistani people, they would see this as another sharp swing of
the U.S. pendulum which would harden their attitudes and make greater cooperation very difficult for
the Pakistani people to accept.
-- There may be greater leverage in giving the Pakistanis incentives to be more aggressive. Of
course, the military's calculation is most important. I'm not sure what is on their shopping list these
days but we would need to balance what would move the needle on AQ against undercutting our
effort to get them to shift their strategic focus away from India. . At the same time, we can be as
forward leaning as possible in support of their counterinsurgency capabilities (equipment, training,
whatever material, intelligence and other assistance we can give them if they move into Wazeristan --
including relief for displaced persons). If they finally take that step, we can do all that is possible to
demonstrate that our arrows are aligned with theirs..
-- On the civilian side, their desire for greater control over how Kerry-Lugar money can be used can
be played to our strategic advantage. If we give them a greater sense that they are directing the use
of these funds -- without greatly undercutting their effectiveness -- it strengthens our position to press
them on AQ.
-- Finally, there is the defining relationship with India. Are there measures that the Indians could take
that would reduce Pakistani anxieties about the Indian front and thus better enable them to focus on
threats to the East, including both AQ and anti-Indian militant groups like LET? Are there confidence
building measures such as information sharing on troop movements that would both reduce
uncertainty and support a Pakistani public narrative for a shift in emphasis from India to the militancy?
To the extent India seeks to have Pakistan move more vigorously against the militants, they could
see such steps as advancing their interests. This is tricky territory but may be worth pursuing.

US Responds To Sri Lanka Protest Over Clinton Remark (AFP) Monday, October 5, 2009 AFP
WASHINGTON (AFP) - The United States, responding to protests from Sri Lanka over remarks by Secretary of State Hillary
Clinton, said it had no recent evidence of women being raped while in Sri Lankan government custody.
In a letter addressed to Sri Lanka's Minister of Foreign Affairs Rohitha Bogollagama, the State Department noted that the
US government and international human rights groups over the years had detailed ""numerous cases of rape and sexual
violence in Sri Lanka, particularly acts committed against women held in detention by the government.""
However, the letter signed by Melanne Verveer, ambassador at large for global women's issues at the State Department
said that ""in the most recent phase of the conflict, from 2006 to 2009 ... we have not received reports that rape and
sexual abuse were used as tools of war, as they clearly have in other conflict area around the world.""
""We hope that this clarification puts the issue in its proper context,"" the letter said, adding that Washington remains
concerned about extrajudicial killings, disappearances and detainee abuse in Sri Lanka.
""Secretary Clinton believes that Sri Lanka must focus to the future and move forward on the promotion of peace and the
protection of human rights,"" the letter said.
Sri Lanka lodged its protest with the US embassy in Colombo over the remarks made by Clinton last month to the United
Nations Security Council.
""We've seen rape used as a tactic of war before in Bosnia, Burma and Sri Lanka and elsewhere,"" the US secretary of state
had said during a resolution calling for an end to sexual violence in armed conflict, according to published reports of
Clinton's remarks.
Her comments sparked an outcry across Sri Lanka, where government forces in May crushed Tamil Tiger rebels after
decades of fighting.
Colombo faced condemnation for its handling of the final stages of the war against Tiger rebels and managed to stave
off a Security Council resolution calling for war crimes investigations thanks to the vetoes of China and Russia.
The United Nations has said that over 7,000 civilians perished in the first four months of intense fighting this year.
Sri Lanka is now facing international pressure to free 250,000 ethnic Tamil civilians who managed to escape the fighting
but are now held in internment camps while they are screened to see whether they were rebels.

Note from Joe Wilson... Sid
Hillary: I'm passing on a note below from Joe Wilson. Sid
Dear Madame Secretary,
It was great to see you, albeit briefly, at the US —Africa business summit. Your speech spoke to the entire
audience as I'm sure you felt from the response. I also appreciate your offer to meet with me the next time we
are both in Washington and would like to take you up on it.
I am now working with a serious American engineering and construction company, Symbion Power, that has
been hugely successful in Iraq and Afghanistan (on fixed cost contracts). It specializes in power plants,
substations and transmission towers and lines. It made its name in Iraq constructing transmission towers and
pulling lines across al Anbar province at the height of the war there. Its business model is to partner with local
companies and to train local employees to do the construction, maintenance and repair, and to provide the
security. In Iraq and Afghanistan they established training centers and graduated over 3000 certified
linemen. They partner with an American Lineman College in Idaho to provide the ed ucation and
certification. We think the model is well adapted to Africa and have already begun work on a training center in
Tanzania, where we will be bidding on all of the upcoming MCC financed power generation and distribution
projects. I have asked Sid to pass a memory stick with a four minute video that explains what Symbion does
and how it does it.
I tell you all this, not to tout Symbion (about which I am very enthusiastic) but let you know that we are doing
much of what you have been advocating in your public comments about human capacity development. The fact
that we have been successful on fixed cost contracts also speaks to your criticism of American companies that
have been milking the government with their cost plus contracts for the last nine years. Our goal is to
demonstrate that an emphasis on developing local talent is not just the right thing to do but is also good
business.
I look forward to seeing you the next time I am in Washington. I know how precious your time is, and very
much appreciate your generosity.

SPONSORED LINKS:
Eight years ago I was standing on a hill 50 miles north of Kabul watching the flashes in the night sky
as the US air strikes started again st the Taliban front line. There were a few ineffective puffs of fire
from Taliban anti-aircraft guns which could do nothing against the bombs and missiles raining down
on them.
It was a strange war to cover, not least because so little real fighting took place. The reputation of the
Afghan fighting man is partly based on agilely joining the winning side at the right moment. In the
meantime they don't fight too hard for anybody and try to avoid getting killed.
The US and British press mostly reported the war of 2001 as a real military conflict and rather missed
the point that the Taliban had just gone home. I remember visiting the former headquarters of a
Taliban armoured brigade in the city of Ghazni south west of Kabul. The tanks and armoured vehicles
had all been smashed to pieces by American bombs, but when I asked local people how many men
the Taliban had lost, I was told ""none at all. They could see what was going to happen so they just
ran away.""
Just as the US military victory of 2001 was overstated, so eight years later is the sense of military
crisis which is being busily stoked by Gen Stanley A McChrystal, the top US and NATO commander
in Afghanistan. In Washington military officials are quoted as saying that the war will be won or lost in
the next twelve months.
This is nonsense. The Taliban have been able to advance so rapidly in the last three years because
they have Pakistani backing and because of the spectacular political and military weakness of
President Hamid Karzai's government. But the Taliban draw all their strength from the Pashtun
community, which makes up 42 per cent of the Afghan population. They will have great difficulty
advancing into areas occupied by the other 58 per cent of the population where there is a Tajik,
Hazara or Uzbek majority.
Squads of six or eight Taliban on motorcycles might be harassing the roads around Kabul, but there
is no need to treat them as if they were North Vietnamese divisions at the gates of Saigon in 1975.
The strength of the Taliban is that not that they can take and hold territory, but that they can inflict
quite small military losses on the US which are politically unacceptable back home. They can do this
through roadside bombs, something the US army speaks as i f it were a new device, though it was
being used against the British army in Ireland in 1921. If the Americans and British try to hold territory
supposedly cleared of Taliban with penny packets of troops then these are vulnerable to being
suddenly targeted by the other side.
It is to prevent this happening that Gen McChrystal has asked for an extra 40,000 soldiers. But
Afghans tell me that more foreign troops will simply mean more violence and dead Afghans as more
of the country becomes a battlefield. It is absurd to imagine that the world's most heavily equipped
military force is not going to use its weapons when it comes under attack. Polls also show that
Taliban support is at its height in just those areas where Afghan civilians have been killed by
American shells and bombs.
So what should Obama do? First of all he has time. He is not going to win or lose the war in the next
year. Like it or not he is stuck with Mr Karzai and he should get used to the idea. It is reasonable to
suggest helping to produce a larger Afghan army and police force but this cannot be done overnight.
Most military recruits are there for the money and are too malnourished even to wear American flack
jackets. Speeding up security training f or Afghan police meant over the summer that terrified men,
often on heroin, were being sent to man dangerous and isolated police posts with just three weeks
training. Many of them did not come back.
One way Obama could strengthen the Afghan army and police is to make sure their men are paid
properly. In Kabul many facilities are being guarded by policemen earning $70 a month, which is not
enough to live on unless supplemented with bribes. This contrasts with $250,000 a year paid to
foreign consultants who lurk inside heavily defended compounds. Paying the Iraqi army properly
really did make a difference in Baghdad and might do the same in Afghanistan where 40 per cent of
men are unemployed. A difference is that Iraqi oil revenues last year were $62 billion while the
Afghan government is dependent on foreign aid.
The US and its allies will have to pay. It is carefully thought out measures like this that Obama should
be considering and not the panicky dispatch of US Special Forces or tens of thousand of more troops.","['Afghanistan', 'London', 'Iraq', 'Kabul', 'US', 'US', 'Ghazni', 'Kabul', 'US', 'US', 'Afghanistan', 'Washington', 'Kabul', 'Saigon', 'US', 'US', 'Ireland', 'Kabul', 'Baghdad', 'Afghanistan', 'US']"

United States Institute of Peace: Background
Proposals for the creation of a government ""peace"" agency stretch as far back as a proposal in 1792 to create a ""Peace
Office"" on par with the War Department. Between 1935 and 1976 over 140 bills were introduced in Congress to
establish peace-related agencies, departments, bureaus, and committees of Congress. In 1979 Congress established the
Commission on Proposals for the National Academy of Peace and Conflict Resolution. In 1981, the Commission — known
as the Matsunaga Commission for its head, Senator Spark Matsunaga — recommended the creation of a national peace
academy. In 1984, President Reagan signed the United States Institute of Peace Act and the first meeting of USIP's Board
of Directors took place in 1986.
The USIP Act established ""an independent, nonprofit, national institute to serve the people and the Government
through the widest possible range of education and trainings, basic and applied research opportunities, and peace
information services on the means to promote international peace and the resolution of conflicts among the nations and
peoples of the world without recourse to violence.""
USIP is an independent agency, funded by Congress, which serves as an intersection between those involved in policy
research, fieldwork, and practitioners. More than 70 USIP policy experts conduct research on a wide variety of country-
specific and cross-cutting functional issues. Some examples of USIP activities include:
® Working in countries such as Iraq, Sudan, Nigeria, Uganda, Pakistan, and Afghanistan to mediate and facilitate
dialogue among parties in conflict, promote the rule of law, strengthen civil society and education systems, and
educating the public through events, films, and other outreach.
O USIP has given out $58 million in grants for over 1,700 peacebuilding projects in 76 countries.
® USIP hosts standing working groups of experts and practitioners on a variety of issues, including Sudan, Syria,
Korea, Iran, Iraq, and Haiti.
® USIP has facilitated a number of task forces, including the Iraq Study Group and the recent Congressional
Commission on the Strategic Posture of the United States, chaired by William Perry.

It's 3 a.m. Do You Know Where Hillary Clinton Is?
By David Rothkopf
Washington Post
Sunday, August 23, 2009
When it comes to Hillary Rodham Clinton, we're missing the forest for the pantsuits.
Clinton is not the first celebrity to become the nation's top diplomat -- that honor goes to her most distant predecessor,
Thomas Jefferson, who by the time he took office was one of the most famous and gossiped-about men in America --
but she may be the biggest. And during her first seven months in office, the former first lady, erstwhile presidential
candidate and eternal lightning rod has drawn more attention for her moods, looks, outtakes and (of course)
relationship with her husband than for, well, her work revamping the nation's foreign policy.
Even venerable publications -- such as one to which I regularly contribute, Foreign Policy -- have woven into their all-
Hillary-all-the-time coverage odd discussions of Clinton's handbag and scarf choices. Daily Beast editor Tina Brown, while
depicting herself as a Clinton supporter, has been scathing and small-minded in discussing such things as Clinton's
weight and hair, while her ""defense"" of Hillary in her essay ""Obama's Other Wife"" was as sexist as the title suggests.
Indeed, sexism has followed Clinton from the campaign trail to Foggy Bottom, as seen most recently in the posturing
outrage surrounding the exchange in Congo when Clinton reacted with understandable frustration to the now-infamous
question regarding her husband's views. Major media outlets have joined the gossipfest, whether the New York Times,
which covered Clinton's first big policy speech by discussing whether she was in or out with the White House, or The
Washington Post, where a couple of reporters mused about whether a brew called Mad Bitch would be the beer of
choice for the secretary of state.
Amid all the distractions, what is Clinton actually doing? Only overseeing what may be the most profound changes in
U.S. foreign policy in two decades -- a transformation that may render the presidencies of Bill Clinton and George W.
Bush mere side notes in a long transition to a meaningful post-Cold War worldview.
The secretary has quietly begun rethinking the very nature of diplomacy and translating that vision into a revitalized
State Department, one that approaches U.S. allies and rivals in ways that challenge long-held traditions. And despite the
pessimists who invoked the ""team of rivals"" cliche to predict that President Obama and Clinton would not get along,
Hillary has defined a role for herself in the Obamaverse: often bad cop to his good cop, spine stiffener when it comes to
tough adversaries and nurturer of new strategies. Recognizing that the 3 a.m. phone calls are going to the White House,
she is instead tackling the tough questions that, since the end of the Cold War, have kept America's leaders awake all
night.
In these early days of the new administration, it has been easy to focus on what Clinton has not achieved or on ways in
which her power has been supposedly constrained. Indeed, some of her efforts have been frustrated by difficult
personnel approvals or disputes with the White House about who should get what jobs. But this is the way of all
administrations. More unusual has been the avidity with which the new president has seized the reins of foreign policy --
more assertively than either George W. Bush or Bill Clinton before him. Obama's centrality amplifies the importance of
his closest White House staffers, while his penchant for appointing special envoys such as Richard Holbrooke (on
Afghanistan and Pakistan) and George Mitchell (on the Middle East) has been interpreted by some as limiting Clinton's
role.
Given the challenges involved, it was perhaps natural that the White House would have a bigger day-to-day hand in
some of the nation's most urgent foreign policy issues. But with Obama, national security adviser Jim Jones, Vice
President Joe Biden and Secretary of Defense Robert Gates absorbed by Iraq, Afghanistan and other inherited problems
of the recent past, Clinton's State Department can take on a bigger role in tackling the problems of the future -- in
particular, how America will lead the world in the century ahead. This approach is both necessary and canny: It
recognizes that U.S. policy must change to fulfill Obama's vision and that many high-profile issues such as those of the
Middle East have often swamped the careers and aspirations of secretaries of state past.
Which nations will be our key partners? What do you do when many vital partners -- China, for example, and Russia --
are rivals as well? How must America's alliances change as NATO is stretched to the limit? How do we engage with rogue
states and old enemies in ways that do not strengthen them and preserve our prerogative to challenge threats? How do
we move beyond the diplomacy of men in striped pants speaking only for governments and embrace potent nonstate
players and once-disenfranchised peoples?
In searching for answers, Clinton is leaving behind old doctrines and labels. She outlined her new thinking in a recent
speech at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, where she revealed stark differences between the new
administration's worldview and those of its predecessors: The recurring themes include ""partnership"" and
""engagement"" and ""common interests."" Clearly, Madeleine Albright's ""indispensable nation"" has recognized the
indispensability of collaborating with others.
Who those ""others"" are is the area in which change has been greatest and most rapid. ""We will put,"" Clinton said,
""special emphasis on encouraging major and emerging global powers -- China, India, Russia and Brazil, as well as Turkey,
Indonesia and South Africa -- to be full partners in tackling the global agenda."" This is the death knell for the G-8 as the
head table of the global community; the administration has an effort underway to determine whether the successor to
the G-8 will be the G-20, or perhaps some other grouping. Though the move away from the G-8 began in the waning
days of the Bush era, that administration viewed the world through a different lens, a perception that evolved from a
traditional great-power view to a pre-Galilean notion that everything revolved around the world's sole superpower.
Obama and Clinton have both made engaging with emerging powers a priority. Obama visited Russia earlier this year
and will host Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in his first state dinner in November. Clinton has made trips to
China and India, and she would have been with Obama in Russia had she not injured her elbow. Both have visited Africa
and the Middle East, reaching out to women and the Islamic world.
On many critical agenda items -- from a rollback of nuclear weapons to the climate or trade talks -- such emerging
powers will be essential to achieving U.S. goals. As a result, we've seen a new American willingness to play down old
differences, whether with Russia on a missile shield or, as Clinton showed on her China trip, with Beijing on human
rights.
At the center of Clinton's brain trust is Anne-Marie Slaughter, the former dean of Princeton's Woodrow Wilson School of
Public and International Affairs. Now head of policy planning at the State Department, Slaughter elaborated on the ideas
in Clinton's speech. ""We envision getting not just a new group of states around a table, but also building networks,
coalitions and partnerships of states and nonstate actors to tackle specific problems,"" she told me.
""To do that,"" Slaughter continued, ""our diplomats are going to need to have skills that are closer to community
organizing than traditional reporting and analysis. New connecting technologies will be vital tools in this kind of
diplomacy.""
A new team has been brought in to make these changes real. Clinton recruited Alec Ross, one of the leaders of Obama's
technology policy team, to the seventh floor of the State Department as her senior adviser for innovation. His mission is
to harness new information tools to advance U.S. interests -- a task made easier as the Internet and mobile networks
have played starring roles in recent incidents, from Iran to the Uighur uprising in western China to Moldova. Whether
through a telecommunications program in Congo to protect women from violence or text messaging to raise money for
Pakistani refugees in the Swat Valley, technology has been deployed to reach new audiences.
Of course, you need more than new ideas to revitalize the State Department; you need resources, too. The secretary has
brought in former Bill Clinton-era budget chief Jack Lew to help her claw back money for statecraft that many in Foggy
Bottom feel has been sucked off toward the Pentagon. She has also created special positions to back new priorities, such
as Melanne Verveer as ambassador at large for women's issues, Elizabeth Bagley to handle public-private outreach
worldwide and Todd Stern as the chief negotiator on climate.
Even just a few months in, it's clear that these appointments are far from window dressing. Lew, Slaughter and the
acting head of the U.S. Agency for International Development are leading an effort to rethink foreign aid with the new
Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review, an initiative modeled on the Pentagon's strategic assessments and
designed to review State's priorities. Stern has conducted high-level discussions on climate change around the world,
notably with China. Clinton made women's issues a centerpiece of her recent 11-day trip to Africa, where she stressed
that ""the social, political and economic marginalization of women across Africa has left a void in this continent that
undermines progress and prosperity.""
Clinton has also signaled the importance of private-sector experience by naming former Goldman Sachs International
vice chairman Robert Hormats, a respected veteran of four administrations, to handle economic issues at the State
Department, as well as Judith McHale, former chief executive of Discovery Communications, to run public diplomacy. In
the same vein, she has opened up Cuba to American telecommunications companies and reached out to India's private
sector on energy cooperation -- showing that this administration will seek to advance national interests by tapping the
self-interests of the business community. As with any new administration, there have been inevitable problems. The old
campaign teams -- Clinton's and Obama's -- still eye each other warily, but this feeling is gradually fading. And by most
accounts, the administration's national security team has come together successfully, with Clinton developing strong
relationships with national security adviser Jones and Defense Secretary Gates. Her policy deputy, Jim Steinberg, has
renewed an old collaboration with deputy national security adviser Tom Donilon; the two of them, working with Obama
campaign foreign policy advisers Denis McDonough and Mark Lippert, have formed what one State Department
seventh-floor dweller called ""a powerful quartet at the heart of real interagency policymaking."" Henry Kissinger may
have overstated matters when he said this is the best White House-State relationship in recent memory, but it's not bad,
while the State-Pentagon relationship is in its best shape in decades.
At the heart of things, though, is the relationship between Clinton and Obama. For all the administration's talk of
international partnerships, that may be the most critical partnership of all.
So far, according to multiple high-level officials at State and the White House, the two seem aligned in their views. In
addition, they are gradually defining complementary roles. Obama has assumed the role of principal spokesperson on
foreign policy, as international audiences welcome his new and improved American brand. Clinton thus far has echoed
his points but has also delivered tougher ones. Whether on a missile shield against Iran or North Korean saber-rattling,
the continued imprisonment of Aung San Suu Kyi in Burma or rape and corruption in Congo, the secretary of state has
spoken bluntly on the world stage -- even if it triggered snide comments from North Korea.
It is still early, and a president's foreign policy legacy is often defined less by big principles than by how one reacts to the
unexpected, whether missiles in Cuba or terrorism in New York. Promising ideas fail because of limited attention or
reluctant bureaucracies, and some rhetoric eventually rings hollow, as the self-congratulatory ""smart power"" already
does to me.
Nevertheless, there is evidence that, seven months into the job, Obama's unlikely secretary of state is supporting and
augmenting his agenda effectively. Not as Obama's ""other wife,"" not as Bill Clinton's wife, not even as a celebrity or as a
former presidential candidate -- but in a new role of her own making.

fyi: Hague report and DeMint... Sid
H: Here's the Guardian account of Hague's post-meeting press briefing. And below that the article on DeMint. S
William Hague addresses US fears over Tories'
EU allies
•Hillary Clinton 'told antisemitism allegations are a smear'
•Shadow foreign secretary opposes Tony Blair as EU leader
• Ewen MacAskill in Washington and Nicholas Watt
• quardian.co.uk, Thursday 22 October 2009 00.33 BST
William Hague, the shadow foreign secretary, yesterday defended the Conservatives' alliance with far-right parties in
Europe during a meeting in Washington with the US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton.
Hague sought to reassure Clinton about the Conservatives' partners, some of whose members have taken part in
commemoration services for the Waffen-SS in Latvia and questioned the need to apologise for an anti-Jewish pogrom in
Poland.
The shadow foreign secretary, who said he had an excellent meeting with Clinton, told her the accusations were part of a
smear campaign by the Guardian and others.
The row has overshadowed Hague's visit to Washington intended as part of the Conservative preparations for taking
power.
Speaking to the media afterwards, Hague said the behaviour of Michal Kaminski, of Poland's Law and Justice party, was
not consistent with anyone who was antisemitic. As for the Latvian party in the Conservatives' European alliance, Hague
said: ""This is a respectable party in Latvia ... To suggest it is antisemitic or neo-Nazi is ludicrous.""
Jewish groups in the US and in Europe have expressed anger over the Tory links.
The state department was careful not be drawn into the issue, not wanting to be accused of interference in UK politics or
issues relating to the European parliament. A spokesman said: ""I can say that the two had a good, wide-ranging
discussion on a broad range of issues, but can't get into details or substance of that discussion.""
Hague tried to persuade Clinton that the Conservatives' Euroscepticism would not necessarily mean Britain would play a
lesser role in European affairs. The US favours the EU acting in unison over Iran and other issues.
Hague said he had raised the allegations of antisemitism with Clinton at the end of a 40-minute discussion on Iran, the
Balkans, the Middle East, Northern Ireland, Afghanistan and climate change.
""No one has raised with me all day the other issue, of the parties in our grouping, but I raised that with secretary of state
Clinton because of press reports in your newspaper [the Guardian] and others in case she had seen those,"" Hague said.
""I have assured her they are mainstream parties of the centre-right ... The Conservative party rejects what it regards as a
smear campaign against some of its members.""
He noted that Kaminski made his first speech in the European Parliament highlighting the problem of anti-semitism in
Europe and had just completed a successful visit to Israel. ""These are not the habits of someone who is anti-semitic,""
Hague said.
As for the Latvians, of the six governing parties, ""five of them have members involved in the type of commemoration that
have been criticised."" Some were members of the Conservatives' previous alliance, the European People's party.
On Conservative Euroscepticism, Hague said: ""I always put the case to all American leaders that it is important to
distinguish between Europe's institutions and its capacity to act ... I have explained to her and others that she will be find
a Conservative government very active and activist from the very beginning in European affairs. ""
Later he said it would be a mistake for Tony Blair to become EU president. He has previously said in private that Blair
would be appointed ""over my dead body"".

Iran-Contra's Scary Sequel
by Art Levine
The Daily Beast
October 10, 2009 I 6:55pm
Republicans have opened a new front against Obama, a southern front, south of the border—Latin America.
The clique of conservatives that has operated since the Iran-Contra scandal and held key policy offices in the
George W. Bush administration is waging war against Obama in part through Sen. Jim DeMint of South
Carolina.
A freshman on the Foreign Relations Committee with no previously known expertise on Latin America, DeMint
is best known for boasting that health care would be the ""Waterloo"" that will ""break"" Obama. He recently
provoked a nasty spat within the committee by requesting funding to travel to Honduras to ""assess"" the crisis.
The Obama administration favors reinstalling the democratically elected president, Manuel Zelaya, a leftist who
was expelled by the military in June. Committee Chairman John Kerry criticized DeMint for his ""intransigence""
in putting a hold on two Obama nominations for State Department jobs in Latin America, and initially denied
money for DeMint's trip. But Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell somehow found funding through the
Defense Department.
""DeMint has been using this issue cynically to hold hostage the entire U.S. policy on Latin America in order to
defend a coup,"" says Adam Isacson, a Latin American specialist at Washington's Center for International
Policy.
""Little Honduras has brought all of the ghosts of the Cold War out of the closet, and paralyzed policy by
provoking the [DeMint] holds,"" Julia Sweig, the director for Latin American Studies of the Council on Foreign
Relations, told me. Some Hill staffers are even blunter: ""These losers from the Bush administration who drove
Latin American policy off a frickin' cliff are trying to rescue their legacy,"" one aide told The Daily Beast.
A number of Democrats and foreign-policy experts contend the mounting right-wing attack on Latin American
policy has filled a void left by an Obama administration that was too slow to cut aid or take a firmer stance
against the president installed by the Honduran military, Roberto Micheletti. Driven partly by a desire to
appease opposition in Congress and distaste for left-wing populists the Obama administration ""slow-walked"" its
response to the coup this summer, Sweig says.
More recently, though, the administration has toughened its approach by cutting off some vital aid worth at least
$35 million and blocking Honduran officials' visas. The goal: to pressure the Micheletti regime to enter into
serious negotiations with the Organization of American States to restore the democratic government and Zelaya.
Informed observers say that indications of Micheletti's flexibility alarmed some right-wingers in Washington
and helped trigger DeMint's visit to buck up the regime's resistance.
An informal network of right-leaning American advocacy groups and ideologues was entangled in anti-Zelaya
legal and PR battles in Honduras before the coup. Among them: Otto Reich, a Cuban-American who headed the
State Department's now-defunct Office of Public Diplomacy during the Iran-Contra scandal, and was
subsequently investigated by a special joint congressional panel—and the U.S. Comptroller General, which
found he engaged in ""prohibited covert activities"" by using public funds to attack Reagan's critics. Reich, who
was later appointed by President George W. Bush to be assistant secretary for Western Hemisphere Affairs and
is now a private consultant, launched a media campaign against Zelaya before the coup alleging corruption.
""Your Loony Left sources say I was an architect of Iran-Contra like they say I'm an architect of the Zelaya
coup,"" he told me by phone from Panama. He disputes claims of illegal Iran-Contra activites as ""crap,""
asserting they were only based on a fired House staffer's unpublished memo. But Greg Grandin, a Latin
American history professor at NYU, has a darker view of Reich's role: ""It's kind of the origins of Swift
Boating,"" he says. ""It's all related to what he's doing now.""
Conservative supporters of the current Honduran government argue on arcane legal grounds against the
worldwide condemnation of the coup. ""It's not the first time all, the countries in the world have been wrong,""
Reich told me. He has criticized what he sees as erroneous reporting on Latin American controversies, taking
The New York Times to task for an article last Thursday that he says implied he was being paid to lobby on
behalf of the Micheletti regime. ""I guess my facts interfered with [the] story,"" he says. ""Can you believe some
of my sources say The New York Times is malicious and deserves the slow death it is experiencing?"" A
DeMint spokesman says the senator hasn't even met with Reich to talk about Honduras, although a Reich aide
says they've spoken to DeMint's staff.
Adding to the mystery of the coup, left-wingers in Latin America and the U.S. have floated what conservatives
say are unproven conspiracy theories that Reich somehow played a role in destabilizing Zelaya's regime. He
has firmly denied them to The Daily Beast: ""I cannot possibly answer all the Loony Left conspiracy charges
against me. But I will try: I had nothing to do with the removal of Zelaya."" But the rumors may add to his aura
of power as founder of Otto Reich Associates. He's drawn more attention to the new Honduras allegations by
penning a column for the Miami Herald boldly headlined, ""I Did Not Orchestrate Coup in Honduras.""
Perhaps the primary influence on DeMint's thinking has been the right-wing Honduran-American lawyer
Miguel Estrada, whose 2001 nomination to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit was rejected by the
Senate. In addition to Reich, other former Bush administration officials who have played key roles in
influencing DeMint and in spreading arguments for the Honduran regime include Roger Noriega, a former aide
to the late Sen. Jesse Helms (the far-right chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee) who also served as an
assistant secretary for Western Hemisphere Affairs from 2003 to 2005. On July 2, Noriega appeared on The
NewsHour with Jim Lehrer to argue the legitimacy of the new Honduran regime. He was identified as a former
ambassador to the Organization of American States and a visiting fellow of the American Enterprise Institute—
not as a paid agent for pro-regime forces.
Noriega officially registered his firm, Visions America, as representing a Honduran business group only in mid-
July. Yet, the Times reported, he worked with the Association of Honduran Manufacturers to set up meetings
between supporters of the regime and eight U.S. senators—including DeMint—in early July. That visit to
Washington by Honduran business and political figures from July 2 to July 10, Foreign Policy reported,
occurred at the same time as a House committee hearing during which Reich—along with a former Honduran
supreme court justice and Lanny Davis, a former Clinton administration official and now a lobbyist—testified
in favor of the current regime. Noriega's office declined to return phone calls about his work.
The lobbyist-organized visit also coincided with Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearings on Obama's
picks for top Latin American posts: Thomas Shannon, current assistant secretary for Western Hemisphere
Affairs, has been nominated to be Ambasssador to Brazil; and Arturo Valenzuela, director of Georgetown
University's Center for Latin American Studies and senior director for Inter-American Affairs at the National
Security Council during President Clinton's second term, has been tapped to be assistant secretary for Western
Hemisphere Affairs. Both Valenzuela and Shannon were approved by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee
in late July. Julia Sweig of the Council on Foreign Relations observes, ""They're not polarizing figures.""
But for now they're hostages in DeMint's war. At the July 8 nomination hearings, Valenzuela angered DeMint
by defending the administration's decision to condemn the overthrow as a coup: ""In my studies of military
coups in Latin America, this was a classic military coup,"" Valenzuela said. DeMint's critics contend that he has
continually refused compromise offers from both State Department officials and fellow senators to lift his holds,
including the promise of an extensive floor debate on Honduras before a floor vote on the nominees.
DeMint's spokesperson, Wesley Denton, says he's acting in good faith out of genuine concern about an
important crisis. ""If these nominees are such a top priority for Democrats, then why hasn't Senator Reid brought
them to the floor?"" he asks. ""There is nothing Senator DeMint can do to stop a full debate and roll-call vote on
them."" Technically that's true, but it would be a rare violation of a Senate tradition to do so. DeMint has taken
up the issue of Honduras, Denton claims, because, ""the State Department's actions were directly relevant to two
nominees seeking the committee's approval.""
Yet before DeMint took up the crusade on Honduras—in what critics say is yet another vehicle to ""break""
Obama—one congressional observer jokes, ""He couldn't find Honduras on a map.""

from Massachusetts helped to shape America's history and chart our shared future. During our time in the White
House, we were thankful for his fierce advocacy and support for universal health care and his work to provide health
coverage to low-income children. Without his tireless efforts, America would not be as close to achieving health care
reform as we are today.Continuing the legacy left by his older brothers, his lifelong pursuit of civil rights and justice for
all moved America forward to form a more perfect union. But beyond his death, his legacy of public service will live on in
millions of young people across our nation who now have the chance to serve through the Edward M. Kennedy Serve
America Act, which will expand AmeriCorps and other youth service opportunities. He loved his country, his wife Vicki,
and his incredible children and grandchildren. We are proud to have known him, worked alongside him, and called him
our friend. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and the people of Massachusetts during this difficult time.","['Massachusetts', 'America', 'White', 'House', 'America', 'America', 'Massachusetts']"

SUBJECT: DEMARCHE/LETTER PRIOR TO AUGUST 28 UNASUR SUMMIT
REF: A. STATE 86734
B. STATE 82581
1.(SBU) This is an action request, see paras 4 - 6.
2.(SBU) On August 14, the USG and Colombian government
provisionally agreed ad referendum to the text of a
bilateral Defense Cooperation Agreement (DCA) (septel).
We expect the final agreement may be signed in Bogota in
about a month, following a final review by both sides. As
noted in reftels, the DCA would permit the United States
access to several Colombian military bases and facilitate
effective bilateral cooperation on security matters in
Colombia. It would not/not authorize establishment of any
U.S. bases or ports, nor would it result in an overall
increase in the number of U.S. military personnel or
U.S.-citizen civilian contractors in Colombia.
3.(SBU) On August 18, the Secretary and Colombian FM
Jaime Bermudez met in Washington to discuss the DCA,
including the importance of coordinating our public
affairs and diplomatic strategies (septel to follow).
There is some concern that the upcoming Union of South
American Nations (UNASUR) summit would become a regional
referendum on the DCA. Colombian President Alvaro Uribe
will attend the summit provided that a full range of
regional security matters can be discussed, not just the
DCA. In this context, we are reaching out to selected
UNASUR members to ask that they raise other regional
security issues beyond the DCA.
4. (SBU) Action requested for Santiago, Asuncion, and
Lima: that you find an opportunity prior to the August 28
summit to raise the importance of discussing the full
range of regional security topics during the summit, and
not merely the DCA, with appropriate high levels of host
government.
265
5. (SBU) Action requested for all: that Ambassadors to
UNASUR member states deliver the attached letter from the
Secretary to host governments in advance of the August 28
summit.
6. (U) Begin text:
Dear Madam/Mr. Minister:
I wanted to take a moment to write to you and your
colleagues about the upcoming summit of the Union of South
American Nations (UNASUR), scheduled for August 28 in
Bariloche. UNASUR provides an important forum to address
the issues and challenges that affect the region. The
United States supports the formation and effective
functioning of regional groups such as UNASUR. They
promote stability, cohesion, and leadership on key issues,
and ensure the best possible communication between
nations.
As you know, our common neighbor,
Colombia, has faced an ongoing threat from an unholy
alliance of terrorist groups funded by the insidious
illegal narcotics trade. These terrorists have threatened
the security of average Colombians and sought to overthrow
by violence and corruption successive,
democratically-elected Colombian governments. The actions
of these groups also threaten the security of other
countries in the hemisphere, sometimes directly, in many
ways indirectly. Over the last decade, Colombians have
beat back this threat, to the benefit of us all. My
country is proud of the role we have been able to play in
this effort.
This battle is far from won. Our governments and people
are collectively forced to find ways to protect ourselves
and our institutions from such threats. I am certain
these very issues will be addressed at the upcoming
summit, including the recently concluded Defense
Cooperation Agreement (DCA). We understand the
sensitivities associated with U.S. military activities in
the hemisphere and the questions your government may have
regarding the scope and extent of this agreement. I hope
the efforts made in the last few weeks by both my
government and the Colombian government have helped
address those questions.
I would like to take this opportunity to make several key
points about the DCA. First, this agreement is a
bilateral agreement with Colombia to deepen our
cooperation on security challenges within Colombia,
permitting U.S. access to specified agreed Colombian
26fi
facilities to undertake mutually agreed activities on
Colombian territory. It is a bilateral agreement that
does not pose any threat or risk for the citizens of other
nations. On the contrary, our mutual efforts to combat
drug trafficking benefit the security of the region as a
whole. The agreement does not permit the establishment of
U.S. bases in Colombia. It will not result in an increase
in the U.S. military presence in Colombia, and we do not
seek any such increase. Activities undertaken at or from
Colombian bases by U.S. persons will be coordinated in
advance by Colombian authorities. All activities will be
based on full respect for the principles of sovereignty,
territorial integrity of states, and
non-interventionism.
We are committed to being as forthcoming as possible in
addressing concerns about this bilateral agreement with
nations in the region, and we have endeavored to do so in
recent weeks through a variety of mechanisms. As concerns
or questions arise, I hope that you will feel free to
reach out to us to seek clarification.
The UNASUR summit provides a unique opportunity for the
organization to address a range of security issues that
affect the hemisphere, and I salute your leadership for
deciding to discuss these matters. The security
challenges affecting our hemisphere, and your nations in
particular, are pressing and grave. Our firm belief is
that a collective and collaborative approach to these
matters is essential. It is our commitment to work with
UNASUR nations to help address these concerns.
Sincerely yours,
Hillary Rodham Clinton

my piece....
Thanks again for Friday. Much favorable comment. Good luck at the UNGA.
President Barack Obama's announcement of a new system.for protecting America's
allies against Iranian missiles has ignited charges that he is scaling back the one he
inherited from George W. Bush as a concession to the Russians.
In fact, the Obama plan is a big improvement on the Bush one, and it is designed to
counter an evolving Iranian threat, not to mollify Russian anxieties.
Mr Bush's decision to put 10 missile interceptors in Poland and an associated radar in
the Czech Republic was based on a concern that Iran was developing long-range rockets
that could hit the US. The Bush system would have been less effective against shorter-
range Iranian missiles, and it would have left much of Europe, notably including America's
ally Turkey, unprotected.
Over the last several years, the Iranians have shifted their efforts from developing a few
long-range rockets to deploying large numbers of shorter-range ones that pose an
immediate danger to southeastern Europe and the Middle East, as well as to US forces
stationed there. Unlike Mr Bush's, Mr Obama's plan will quickly field a missile-defence
capability to address an existing threat. It can be upgraded to deal with longer-range
Iranian missiles in the future.
The Central Europeans who have reacted to the decision with apprehension or alarm
should recognize that the replacement of a conceptually flawed plan with a more credible
one strengthens the bonds of transatlantic defence.
The view from Moscow has been clouded by outright paranoia. Military experts there
suspected that the US rockets in Poland, while advertised as defensive, could be used
offensively, even pre-emptively, against Russia. Laying to rest that far-fetched scenario
was not the prime motivation for Mr Obama's decision, nor should it have been. However,
by removing what has been a gratuitous irritant in bilateral relations, the president has
improved the prospects for US-Russian arms control negotiations now underway in
Geneva.
Those talks could produce by December a new treaty reducing numbers of strategic -
that is, intercontinental — weapons. If ratified by the US Senate (which will not be easy,
given the ferocity of the partisan wars in Washington), the US and Russia will be on track
for further reductions in the future. Mr Obama and Russian President Dmitri Medvedev,
who are due to meet in New York this week, have jointly called for the eventual goal of
eliminating nuclear weapons.
As they and their successors take steps in that direction, they will have to grapple with a
stark paradox of the nuclear age: mutual deterrence depends on each side being
vulnerable to retaliation from the other. If either side has enough defences to trump the
other side's offence, the mutuality of deterrence breaks down and one or both sides will be
on hair-trigger, making war more likely in a crisis.
American statesmen pounded this inescapable truth into the heads of their initially
sceptical Soviet counterparts 40 years ago. The result was the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM)
treaty signed by Richard Nixon and Leonid Brezhnev in 1972. By limiting the defensive
capability of both superpowers, the ABM treaty was a necessary companion piece to a
series of treaties setting ceilings on offensive weaponry. Because nuclear weapons were
expected to with us forever, the ABM treaty was meant to last in perpetuity.
While the Soviets were converted to the logic of restricting defence, Ronald Reagan
was not. The late US president championed the development of a space-based
comprehensive shield that would make offensive weapons — and therefore mutual
deterrence — ""impotent and obsolete.""
Many experts believed Reagan's vision, which they derisively nicknamed Star Wars, was
an impossible dream. So did his successor, George H. W. Bush, who treated the program
with benign neglect while negotiating with the Russians in the Strategic Arms Reduction
Talks (START) begun by Mr Reagan.
The second president Bush reversed his father's policy. He greatly weakened the
START process, pulled the US out of the ABM treaty and sought to revive a national
missile defence (NMD) system. His decision to build the interceptor and radar sites in
Poland and the Czech Republic was, as one of his aides told me at the time, in large
measure about ""pouring concrete for what will eventually be a global NMD.""
Key officials of the Obama administration — including the president himself, who studied
arms control in college — understand the linkage between reduction of offences and
regulation of defences. However, they have avoided raising that issue in the context of last
week's decision. That is partly because they want their plan to be judged on its own
merits, vis-à-vis the Iranian threat. But it is because they have more than enough fights
with the Republicans without further energizing the right wing by trying to reinstate the
principles of the ABM treaty.
Yet sooner or later the US administration will have to grasp the nettle of regulating
strategic defences. Otherwise, continued reductions in strategic nuclear offences will be
either impossible or, worse, dangerous.

TO: Secretary Clinton
FROM: Chris Falvo
DATE: September 8, 2009
RE: NY Local Issues
Schools - NYC public schools open on Wednesday, September 9th. As a result, you will be visiting a charter school that
opened a couple of weeks ago instead of a public school. Mike Mulgrew, who took over as President of the UFT when
Randi left for AFT, will be present at the event and should be acknowledged in your remarks. His aides who you have
met numerous times, Dick Riley and Bridget Rein, will also be present. Mike appointed Dick as his press secretary last
month.
H1N1 - Mayor Bloomberg did a rollout earlier this week on NYC's plans to handle this health concern, and a significant
portion discusses schools. Unlike what was done in the Spring, this time closing schools will be a last resort. Reason is
that they found kids still contaminate each other by going to movies and playgrounds when the schools are closed, so
instead they are asking sick kids to stay home.
And if four percent of a student body experiences the flu on a single day, a doctor will visit to monitor the situation.
Every student in a NYC school will be offered free H1N1 flu shots or mist once a vaccine is available.
Primary day - September 15th is primary day. In addition to Bill Thompson for Mayor, the primary races that have been
closely followed are Public Advocate and City Comptroller. Running for Public Advocate are Councilmember Eric Gioia,
Councilmember Bill DeBlasio, former Public Advocate Mark Green, and civil rights lawyer Norman Siegel. Running for

Rangel - As of last week House Speaker Pelosi plans to allow Rep. Rangel to keep his chairmanship of the Ways and
Means Committee despite his ethics problems. According to amended forms recently filed with the House, Rangel failed
to disclose at least $800,000 in assets and income since 2002. This comes amid a House ethics investigation into his
failure to report income from and pay taxes on a villa in the Dominican Republic and his ties to a real-estate developer
who leased him four rent-stabilized apartments in New York. The panel is also looking into Rangel's fundraising and
whether he improperly used his office to raise money for a public policy center in his name at the City University of New
York. Rangel has denied any wrongdoing and says its accounting mistakes and simple oversights. The NY Post and
Buffalo News have called for his resignation. Speaking at a health-care forum in Washington Heights last Tuesday, Rangel
said that bias and prejudice toward Obama are fueling opposition to health-care reform. ""Some Americans have not
gotten over the fact that Obama is president of the United States. They go to sleep wondering, 'How did this happen?' ""
Rangel said. Rangel then likened the battle over health-care expansion for the uninsured to the fight for civil rights.
""Why do we have to wait for the right to vote? Why can't we get what God has given us? That is the right to live as
human beings and not negotiate with white southerners and not count the votes. Just do the right thing,"" he said. After
the forum, Rangel insisted he was not smearing opponents as racists. ""What I'm saying is, if you watch the town-hall
meetings, people were angry and did not care what the answer was to some of their questions. They were angry with
their member of Congress, period,"" he said. Rangel's comments came less than two weeks after Governor Paterson
claimed he has been the victim of a racist white media -- and also suggested that opposition to Obama's plan is racially
driven. The White House disagreed with Paterson's comments.

The Power Grid
Back From the Death Panel How the public option, helped by a congressman looking for an issue and a shrewdly silent White House,
returned from the brink.
•Published Oct 11, 2009
On the night last week when much of Washington was joyously weeping over the seal of approval bestowed on the Baucus health-care
bill by the Congressional Budget Office, Anthony Weiner was in his quarters in the Rayburn Building, merrily pissing all over the
legislation instead. ""It's just too weak,"" he told me. ""It doesn't do enough It doesn't achieve real cost savings. There's no real
competition. It's pretty much a wish list for the insurance companies."" And those were merely Weiner's substantive criticisms of the
bill. His political assessment was even harsher: ""It's effectively dead,"" he said. Not a droplet of Weiner's dismissal of the Baucus
plan came as any sort of shock; he's been trashing the Senate Finance Committee's efforts for weeks. What's surprising is that anyone
gives a fig what Weiner has to say about the topic in the first place. Until six months ago, after all, the congressman was known more
for his yearning to acquire the keys to Gracie Mansion than his mastery of the arcana of Medicare reimbursement rates. In fact, as
Weiner would be the first to admit, his interest in, knowledge of, and record on health-care reform were perilously close to
nonexistent. And yet, since May, when he concluded that taking on Mike Bloomberg was a challenge that went beyond the Sisyphean
into the realm of the just plain silly, Weiner has emerged as one of the few real stars in the marathon health-care debate: the clearest
and savviest (and, as always, loudest and noodgiest) voice in favor of the public option. And though it's plain that whatever bill
eventually lands on Barack Obama's desk—and, yes, I think the odds are now close to overwhelming that a big pile of health-care
paper will wind up there—won't be anything close to Weiner's single-payer dream, his role in framing the terms of the discussion has
been more than salutary. In some non-obvious ways, you could argue that it's been essential. I should confess at the outset that I have
a long-standing soft spot for Weiner, whom I first met more than twenty years ago, when he was a budding Chuck Schumer protégé
and we played on the same Capitol Hill softball team. Weiner then was strikingly similar to Weiner now: amped-up, ambitious,
wicked smart, forever gauging all the angles, unafraid of being (actually, proud of being) a royal pain in the tuchis. All the qualities, in
other words, that have served him so well in the wrangle over health care. Weiner describes his efflorescence on the subject as a
matter of opportunism, in the best sense of the word. ""This was one of those unusual issues where we really didn't have a mother ship
that was directing the message, and that created an entrepreneurial environment,"" he says. ""You didn't have the president out there
speaking clearly about what he wanted. And among my colleagues, there weren't people that jumped out who either had a comfort
with the material or weren't intimidated by the blowback"" Weiner laughs. ""Frankly, I like the blowback. After my thirteenth town-
hall meeting, someone on my staff said, 'I can't tell if you're a sadist or a masochist.— Weiner is right about the nature of the vacuum
that he smartly stepped in to fill, but there are at least two other proximate causes for it that should be added to his list: the illness and
death of Ted Kennedy and the migration of Hillary Clinton out of the Senate and into Foggy Bottom, which deprived the debate of
what would have been its two dominant liberal protagonists. For Weiner, Clinton's absence and its implications carry a personal twist;
he is engaged to Huma Abedin, Hillary's longtime personal aide. ""It's a weird irony that I'm kind of part of the family now and this
has become my issue,"" Weiner says. ""If Hillary had stayed in the Senate, I would never have had this opening."" Weiner allows that
he's discussed the health-care battle with Clinton; what she's told him he will not say. But one imagines she approves of the
cleverness and chutzpa he's displayed—especially in drawing an explicit analogy between the public option and Medicare, an
equation that not only increases support for the proposal among voters but flushes out the phoniness of the Republican howls against a
""government takeover"" of health care. And one similarly imagines Madame Secretary's chagrin at watching the Obama White House
pursue a dance-of-the-seven-veils strategy explicitly designed to be the antithesis of the one she employed back in 1993 and
1994. Weiner's view of the administration's approach hasn't exactly been approving—a point he's made abundantly and consistently
clear over the past months. On the eve of Obama's September speech before a joint session of Congress, Weiner cracked that ""up to
now, the messaging from the White House has been done by Sybil ... They seem to have a different perspective on this every couple
of hours."" And he's apparently had no change of heart. ""The president has been a miserable messenger on this by and large,"" he tells
me.
Such criticisms haven't gone unnoticed at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, in no small part because Weiner—in a testament to his
consistency, lunacy, inability to shut up, or all three—hasn't shied away from making them directly. Indeed, on a recent flight back to
Washington from New York on Air Force One, I'm told by one congressman who witnessed the scene, Weiner got into a testy","['New', 'York', 'White', 'House', 'Washington', 'Rayburn', 'Building', 'Gracie', 'Mansion', 'Capitol', 'Hill', 'Pennsylvania', 'Avenue', 'Washington', 'New', 'York']"

talks
White House spurned five requests from PM's aides for bilateral meeting

Gordon Brown lurched from being hailed as a global statesman to intense embarrassment tonight, after it
emerged US President Barack Obama had turned down no fewer than five requests from Downing Street to
hold a bilateral meeting at the United Na tions in New York or at the G20 summit starting in Pittsburgh today.
The prime minister, eager to portray himself as a leading player on the international stage in America this week,
was also forced to play down suggestions from inside his own party that he might step down early, either due to
ill health or deteriorating eyesight.
There have been tensions between the White House and No 10 for weeks over Brown's handling of the Scottish
government's decision to release the man convicted of the Lockerbie bombing, Abdelbaset al-Megrahi.
Brown's efforts to secure a prestigious primetime slot for his keynote speech at the general assembly in New
York were also thwarted when the Libyan leader, Colonel Gaddafi, delivered a 100-minute speech to the UN,
massively running over Brown's 15 minute slot.
Brown had not only been seeking a bilateral meeting with Obama, but feelers were also sent out to hold a joint
press conference, an event that would have boosted Brown's efforts to offer himself as a linchpin of
international diplomacy. Government sources said that Britain even changed its policy on swine flu
immunisation in Africa to match that of the Obama administration last week, in an attempt to rebuild relations.
No 10 denied there had been any hint of a snub, saying Obama and Brown had plenty of chances to talk as they
sat next to one another at the summits. They insisted they were working closely on issues such as future
economic regulation, bankers' bonuses, nuclear non-proliferation and climate change. Brown himself insisted: ""I
do say that the special relationship is strong, it continues to strengthen.""
But Obama has held bilateral meetings in New York with the Chinese president, Hu Jintao, the Russian
president, Dmitry Medvedev, and the new Japanese prime minister, Yukio Hatoyama.
News of the five spurned approaches compounded a miserable day for Brown at home which saw a
parliamentary aide resign over the prime minister's refusal to sack Lady Scotland, the attorney general, after she
was fined £5,000 for employing an illegal immigrant, as well as a withering attack by the former home secretary
Charles Clarke.
Stephen Hesford, Labour MP for Wirral West, told Brown in a resignation letter: ""In my view, the facts of the
case do not matter. It is the principle which counts, particularly at a time when the public's trust of Whitehall is
uncertain to say the least. We have to be seen to be accountable.""
Brown was also savaged by Charles Clarke, who told the Evening Standard that in his view Brown's leadership
risked letting ""the whole Labour ship crash on to the rocks of May 2010 [the expected date of the general
election] and sink for a very long time"". He said he hoped rumours that Brown would quit would come true. ""I
think his own dignity ought to look to that kind of solution.""
In two interviews , Brown was forced for the first time to field questions about his health. ""My sight is not at all
deteriorating,"" he told NBC.
Asked on BBC Radio 5 Live whether he might quit for health reasons, the prime minister replied: ""I am healthy
and I am very fit. I run a lot to keep fit and I will continue to keep fit.
""I keep going. I have got a job to do. I have got work to do. We have got to meet this challenge.""
In his own speech to the UN, Obama promised an end to the unilateralism marked by the previous Bush
administration, an approach that saw US and Britain working in tandem. In remarks that suggest Obama will
focus on broadening American alliances across the globe, he said: ""The time has come for the world to move in
a new direction ... a new era of engagement based on mutual interest and mutual respect.""
Last week, the White House had unusually briefed that Obama had told B rown in a phone conversation that he
disapproved of the release of the Lockerbie bomber on compassionate grounds, something No 10 had not
highlighted. Megrahi was released on the basis that he had three months to live, and then received a hero's
welcome as he returned to Tripoli.
Brown had said he respected the release, but insisted undertakings by the Libyans that the return would be low-
key had been broken.
In an attempt to distance himself from the Libyans, Brown moved to toughen his position against Colonel
Gaddafi after Libya's leader theatrically tore up the UN charter in his address. Gaddafi said the security council
should be renamed ""the terror council"".
Brown countered in his speech in New York later: ""I am here to reaffirm the UN charter, not to tear it up. I call
on everyone to support its universal principles.""
He urged world leaders to recognise that the next six months presented tests on climate change and terrorism
that were as huge as the banking crisis. On climate change he said: ""If we miss this opportunity to protect our
planet, we cannot hope for a second chance some time in the future. There will be no retrospective global
agreement to undo the damage we have caused. This is the moment now to limit and reverse climate change we
are inflicting on future generations.""
He added: ""If the poorest and most vulnerable are going to be able to adapt, if the emerging economies are
going to embark on low-carbon development paths, if the forest nations are going to slow and stop
deforestation, then the richer countries must contribute financially.""
No 10 again denied that the prime minister had been snubbed last night. A spokesman said the stories were
""without foundation. As we have said throughout the week, the prime minister and President Obama are having
a number of meetings throughout the week. These included a wide-ranging discussion following last night's
climate change dinner. They will also be co-chairing an important meeting on Thursday on Pakistan and the
fight against terrorism. As the prime minister has already said, there will be further meetings at the G20 summit
in Pittsburgh.""","['London', 'US', 'Downing', 'Street', 'United', 'Na', 'New', 'York', 'Pittsburgh', 'America', 'Lockerbie', 'New', 'York', 'Britain', 'Africa', 'New', 'York', 'Scotland', 'US', 'Britain', 'Lockerbie', 'Tripoli', 'Libya', 'New', 'York', 'Pakistan', 'Pittsburgh']"

relationship' sinks to new low
Gordon Brown has been snubbed repeatedly by Barack Obama
during his trip to the United States, as the fall-out from the release of
the Lockerbie bomber appeared to have left ""the special relationship""
at its lowest ebb for nearly 20 years.
By Andrew Porter, Political Editor in New York
Published: 11:49PM BST 23 Sep 2009
British officials made five attempts to secure official talks with the US President and even agreed to a policy
change in an attempt to land a joint appearance between the two leaders, said diplomatic sources.
But the White House rebuffed the offers and Mr Brown, who had hoped to increase his popularity by appearing
on his own with Mr Obama, had to settle instead for a snatched conversation with the President in a New York
kitchen.
The setbacks led to fears that relati ons between Downing Street and the White House were at their lowest point
since John Major's frosty dealings with Bill Clinton.
It was disclosed earlier this week that Mr Brown would not hold bilateral talks with Mr Obama, despite the
President hosting individual meetings with the leaders of Japan, China and Russia. Downing Street claimed that
this was not unusual.
However, a British diplomat told The Daily Telegraph that the White House's refusal to meet Mr Brown had
been a serious embarrassment for the Prime Minister.
""It is wrong for people to say that we have been relaxed about the way things have gone,"" the source said.
""There were five attempts to set up a meeting and none have come off.""
The most striking example of Downing Street's desperation to engineer a meeting was a change of policy on
supplying swine flu vaccines to Africa. It aimed to match America's commitment and was announced last week.
As a result, it had been hoped that Mr Obama would agree to a joint press conference, according to a senior
source. However, the meeting never happened.
The White House said that Mr Brown and Mr Obama would chair a meeting tonight about Pakistan, and would
""spend all day Friday together."" However, Friday's meeting in Pittsburgh involves the full G20 group of world
leaders.
The release=2 Oof the Lockerbie bomber, Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed al Megrahi, appears to have been behind the
new chill in relations between Washington and London.
Mr Obama expressed his dismay at the release in a telephone call with the Prime Minister earlier this month.
Downing Street's original account of the conversation failed to refer to the President's anger.
Mr Brown has maintained that freeing the Libyan was a matter entirely for the Scottish executive.
Nearly 200 Americans died when Pan Am flight 103 was blown up over Scotland in 1988. Yesterday, families
of victims protested at the UN in New York where Mr Brown and Libya's leader, Col Muammar Gaddafi, made
speeches.
Last night Downing Street played down suggestions of a rift with the White House and pointed to an informal
discussion that Mr Brown had with Mr Obama after a climate change dinner at the UN on Tuesday night. The
15-minute ""walk and chat"" took place in a kitchen of the UN headquarters as both men left the building in
Manhattan.
No 10 maintained that there was nothing unusual in the Prime Minister not holding a separate ""bilateral""
meeting with the President. There was little doubt that Mr Brown would have relished a high profile meeting
with Mr Obama.
In a speech to the United Nations, Mr Obama said the world must ""move in a new direction"" and ""embrace20a
new era of engagement"". That was seen as a sign that the President was more likely to place emphasis on
relations with a wide range of countries rather than rely on old alliances. Mr Brown's increasingly poor
relationship with the White House contrasts sharply with that of his predecessor Tony Blair, who enjoyed close
friendships with both Mr Clinton and George W Bush.
John Major's Tory government had difficulty with Mr Clinton, however, because of claims that Mr Major had
tried to help George Bush Snr's re-election campaign in 1992 by allowing researchers to dig into Mr Clinton's
student past at Oxford — something Sir John has always denied.
Mr Brown, whose plans for a lunchtime speech to the United Nations were derailed after Col Gaddafi spoke for
96 minutes, faced attacks on several fronts yesterday.
Kathy Tedeschi and Sue Kosmowski, Americans who lost husbands in the Lockerbie bombing, travelled to
New York to protest outside the UN headquarters. They claimed that Mr Brown had put trade interests ahead of
justice for victims families.
The Prime Minister was also accused of trying to appease Iran by ignoring the supression of opposition in order
to safeguard talks on its nuclear programme.
Shirin Ebadi, Iran's only Nobel Peace Prize winner, said the West cared more about its own securit y than
human rights.
Mr Brown was criticised for failing to stay at a dinner where he was honoured as Statesman of the Year. Guests
paid $1,000 to attend the function attended by, among others, Henry Kissinger and the pop star Bono.","['United', 'States', 'Lockerbie', 'New', 'York', 'US', 'New', 'York', 'Downing', 'Street', 'White', 'House', 'Japan', 'China', 'Russia', 'Downing', 'Street', 'Africa', 'America', 'Pakistan', 'Pittsburgh', 'Lockerbie', 'Washington', 'London', 'Scotland', 'New', 'York', 'Libya', 'Manhattan', 'White', 'House', 'Lockerbie', 'New', 'York', 'Iran', 'Iran', 'West']"

Holbrooke has assembled an unprecedented interagency team to carry out the work on
Af/Pak — a whole-of-government team in DC and a reorganized and reenergized U.S.
mission in Kabul.
Holbrooke's team is actually getting things done, including the implementation of more
than 20 detailed action plans. Some examples of the work thus far:
• The civilian surge in Afghanistan is on pace to meet targets by end of year.
• Our approach to assistance in Afghanistan has changed dramatically, both through the
consolidation of efforts under Tony Wayne and the review (and sometimes rejection) of
assistance contracts.
•
• Holbrooke has opened and is actively pursuing R/R channels.
• The swift and comprehensive U.S. response helped alleviate and reduce the impact of the
Swat refugee crisis.
•
• The trilateral meetings have helped create conditions for progress on key cross-border
issues.
)11
• Holbrooke's international diplomacy — in the Gulf, with China, with the cadre of other
special representatives — has translated into funding and equipment commitments, more
buy-in, and more patience.
Holbrooke has been a key driver of (non-military) strategic innovation in Afghanistan and
Pakistan. Here are some examples:Ill
Defining a regional approach to Af/Pak (including trilateral summits)
• The regional approach championed by Holbrooke became a central feature of the Reidel
report; the trilats are a pure Holbrooke invention
Afghanistan
The clearest voice and thinker on swifter and more heavily resourced ""Afghanization"" -
primarily by standing up a sufficiently large and sufficiently capable ANSF — as the preferable
alternative to adding more troops.
• The Reidel report calls for training 134,000 army and 82,000 police over two years;
Holbrooke is working through a strategy that would more than double those numbers and
speed the pace of training. Such a strategy has to resolve significant obstacles,
particularly with respect to the police.
Framing and executing the U.S. approach to Afghan elections:
•
Developing a strategy — in partnership with the Afghan government and others — for pursuing
reconciliation/reintegration.
• The Reidel report discusses support for the Afghan government's efforts to reintegrate
""non ideologically-committed"" insurgents who lay down their arms, renounce al Qaeda,
and accept the Afghan Constitution. Holbrooke was key in developing this aspect of the
report, and is now working through the next phases.
Prioritizing a shift in emphasis on counternarcotics from eradication to interdiction
• The Reidel report discusses the need for increased interdiction efforts — and the attendant
need to support licit agriculture to shift livelihoods.
Emphasizing and executing our engagement with Arab allies, China, and Turkey
• The Reidel report speaks generally about engaging all those with a stake in the region. It
does not lay out a specific diplomatic strategy or priority countries.
• [NOTE:
• This issue does not get extensive treatment in the Reidel report.
Pakistan
• The Reidel report does not speak in any detail to this issue.
Responding decisively to the refugee crisis in Swat and Buner
• Obviously, the Reidel report does not address this. The immediate response to the
refugee crisis was Holbrooke's team at its finest.
Making the image of the United States in Pakistan as a critical strategic priority
• The Reidel report focuses on strategic communications in Afghanistan. Holbrooke's
recent trip with Judith McHale is the latest in an ongoing effort to develop a strategic
communications plan for Pakistan. Generally, Holbrooke, along with McDonough, has
been the key mover on all things related to strategic communications in both Afghanistan
and Pakistan; he has a good sense of what is missing and what is needed.
Pursuing a major new energy initiative to address Pakistan's economic troubles and boost
support for the United States
• The Reidel report mentions energy as a key sector where we should be encouraging
foreign investment.

Hillary Clinton Pledges to 'Banish Sexual Violence'
Originally posted Friday August 21, 2009 12:30 PM EDT
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton may be taking some well-earned R&R in Bermuda this week, but last week, the former
First Lady and U.S. Senator wrapped up a grueling seven-nation diplomatic mission to Africa.
While much was made back home about her snapping at a Congolese student who asked her about Bill Clinton's
thoughts on a trade issue (""My husband is not the secretary of state, I am,"" she retorted), the emotional heart of her
tour was also her most dangerous stop — in Goma, inside the war zone in eastern Congo, where she tearfully met rape
victims on Aug. 11.In this exclusive Op-Ed piece for PEOPLE.com, Secretary Clinton shares what she learned on her visit -
and what she will do about it.
What I Saw in Goma
By Hillary Rodham Clinton
In 11 days of travel across Africa, I saw humanity at its worst — and at its best. In Goma last week, I saw both.
The Mugunga Internally Displaced Persons Camp sits in a land of volcanoes and great lakes on the edge of Goma, a
provincial capital in the eastern Congo. The camp is now home to 18,000 people seeking refuge from a cycle of violent
conflict that has left 5.4 million dead since 1998. Chased from their homes and villages by armed rebels and informal
militias, these men, women and children walked for miles with little food or water until they reached this relatively safe
haven.
Now they live in tents, one next to the other, row after row, some clinging to life, others hanging on to whatever
glimmer of hope remains in a region plagued by years of brutality. Many of these people have been robbed of their
homes, possessions, families and, worst of all, their dignity.
Women and girls in particular have been victimized on an unimaginable scale, as sexual and gender-based violence has
become a tactic of war and has reached epidemic proportions. Some 1,100 rapes are reported each month, with an
average of 36 women and girls raped every day.
I visited a hospital run by the organization Heal Africa and met a woman who told me that she was eight months'
pregnant when she was attacked. She was at home when a group of men broke in. They took her husband and two of
their children and shot them in the front yard, before returning into the house to shoot her other two children. Then
they beat and gang-raped her and left her for dead. But she wasn't dead. She fought for life and her neighbors managed
to get her to the hospital — 85 kilometers away.
I came to Goma to send a clear message: The United States condemns these attacks and all those who commit them and
abet them. They are crimes against humanity.
These acts don't just harm a single individual, or a single family, or village, or group. They shred the fabric that weaves us
together as human beings. Such atrocities have no place in any society. This truly is humanity at its worst.
But there is reason to hope. We have seen survivors summon the courage to rebuild their lives and their communities.
We have seen civic leaders and organizations come together to combat this appalling scourge. And we have seen health
care workers sacrifice comfortable careers so they can treat the wounded
in Goma, I met doctors and advocates who work every day to repair the broken bodies and spirits of women who have
been raped, often by gangs, and often in such brutal fashion that they can no longer bear children, or walk or work.
Caregivers like Lyn Lusi, who founded Heal Africa in Goma, and Dr. Denis Mukwege, who founded the Panzi hospital in
Bukavu, represent humanity at its best.
The United States will stand with these brave people. This week I announced more than $17 million in new funding to
prevent and respond to gender and sexual violence in the Democratic Republic of Congo. We will provide medical care,
counseling, economic assistance and legal support. We will dedicate nearly $3 million to recruit and train police officers
to protect women and girls and to investigate sexual violence. We will send technology experts to help women and
front-line workers report abuse using photographs and video and share information on treatment and legal options. And
we will deploy a team of civilian experts, medical personnel and military engineers to assess how we can further assist
survivors of sexual violence.
While I was in the DRC, I had very frank discussions about sexual violence with President Kabila. I stressed that the
perpetrators of these crimes, no matter who they are, must be prosecuted and punished. This is particularly important
when they are in positions of authority, including members of the Congolese military, who have been allowed to commit
these crimes with impunity.
Our commitment to survivors of sexual and gender-based violence did not begin with my visit to Goma, and it will not
end with my departure.
We are redoubling our efforts to address the fundamental cause of this violence: the fighting that goes on and on in the
eastern Congo. We will be taking additional steps at the United Nations and in concert with other nations to bring an
end to this conflict.
There is an old Congolese proverb that says, ""No matter how long the night, the day is sure to come."" The day must
come when the women of the eastern Congo can walk freely again, to tend their fields, play with their children and
collect firewood and water without fear. They live in a region of unrivaled natural beauty and rich resources. They are
strong and resilient. They could, if given the opportunity, drive economic and social progress that would make their

Re: Branch Book
Overview:
There are few surprises in this book. The ""surprises"" that might exist are buried and took a close reading to pick
up on—the two main ones are about the terror clause of WJC's crime bill and why he hadn't disclosed
information about Lewinsky (because he hadn't wanted to become a witness against her). There are a lot of
things that have been covered in My Life and other publications. Quite honestly the book was pretty boring and
much more focused on Branch than I had anticipated. While not as ""and this day, and the next day"" as My Life,
it does share many of the same elements that would engage only a true Clinton fanatic or historian. The fact that
there appears to be no index also makes it difficult for anyone looking for a quick hit to get one. Furthermore,
WJC's words are so interlaced with Branch's recollection through his dictations, that the number of direct WJC
quotes was far fewer than I had expected.
HRC was not as much of a player as one might imagine. Her role is largely seen through her interactions with
Branch when he is recording WJC. Her statements were consistent with the past, with the exception of the
Gephardt comment, and didn't grab much attention at all.Ell (Others included HRC's devotion to CVC, thought
that there should not be a special prosecutor and images of her returning from meetings. They were pretty much
aligned with her interactions with Branch.) Surprisingly, or not surprisingly, many of the problems discussed in
the book are those, which face the current Administration—Middle East peace, North Korea, China, etc...
Branch repeatedly injects his feelings on specific subjects and seems to use the book to voice his own opinion
of the Administration and events of the time. He clearly has topics he prefers over others (for example his
connection with the events in Haiti result in a lot of discussion about it), but there are some subjects that are
strikingly sparsely discussed such as Rwanda. Its absence from long discussions was surprising, but it did not
appear as thought WJC ever-dodged questions about the topic, they just weren't addressed. Much like My Life,
one theme that repeated itself was WJC's conflict with and disdain for the media, especially long passages
about NYT and Washington Post. There are a few instances where gives them credit on their reporting, but you
would be hard-pressed to find them. Additionally, there are numerous mentions of WJC's acute allergies and his
chronic fatigue, with imagery of him falling asleep in sessions on more than a couple occasions.
The book has quite a bit on Whitewater, but given the dearth of public documentation there is little that Branch
could write that hadn't been said. One thing I had not recalled was the D'Amato's subpoena of CVC's friends,
later quashed, who slept over while HRC's Rose Law Firm records were in the White House. Branch does
portray a helpful distinction in how WJC looked at Whitewater and other scandals. While WJC attacks
Whitewater as a political hunt, Branch does have him WJC saying that Filegate needed to be separated from
Whitewater, because this was a legitimate inquiry. There are some quips that could catch someone's eye, such
as WJC referring to Paula Jones as ""a 'new bimbo' he [WJC] didn't even recognize.""
Branch does not dwell on Lewinsky or the impeachment. With the exception of Bruce, Bennett and Kendall, no
other lawyers are mentioned. There is one passage that I am looking into, in which WJC says part of the reason
he didn't mention his relationship with Lewinsky at first was because she was being threatened with jail time if
she was found to be lying under oath and had he told the truth he could become a witness against her. This is a
very small passage that could easily be missed, but one that it is important to note as I don't recall hearing this
before. (This is addressed more fully below.)
There are a few relationships that track through the book more than others. They include WJC's relationship
with Gore, which maps in part because it is not a focal point until the end, and his contentious relationship with
Janet Reno. The one Senator that appears to be most discussed negatively is Moynihan. All three of these issues
are discussed in turn below. WJC is portrayed as an extremely loving and attentive father and HRC is portrayed
in a much more human light than other books/articles covering this time period, with ample mention of her
relationship with CVC and images of affection between her and WJC, both pre- and post-impeachment.
On foreign relations there is a lot of time spent discussing the Middle East, Northern Ireland, the Balkans,
China, Russia, Pakistan/India and in the beginning of the book, Haiti. (Note: Much of what is written about
Haiti is about Branch's own experience there and on the subject.) There is also a fair amount of discussion
about North Korea, but nothing that has not been discussed in the past few weeks. Bin Laden is discussed in
what seems to track mention of him in My Life, which seems to have more detail and background than this
book.
In certain cases there is more detail here than in My Life, for example on his trip to Pakistan WJC wrote that the
USSS cancelled one stop because they would be ""defenseless"" flying in, whereas Brach writes that the streets
would be lined with ""assassins."" There are candid looks at WJC's take on certain people and the relationship
between some, such as Albright and Berger's dislike of Holbrooke, and a more detailed depiction of Yeltsin's
drinking, such as yelling outside of Blair House for a cab to get pizza.
One thing to note, is that often times WJC seems to be speaking to Branch intentionally without the recorders
going, but Branch writes about those interactions and exchanges nonetheless. Such is the case with HRC's
Gephardt comment.

Wen Ho Lee and Terror Clause of Crime Bill
In discussing Wen Ho Lee's release Branch characterizes WJC's lack of knowledge about the strained
interpretation of the anti-terrorist provisions in the crime bill and arbitrary detentions as a ""confession."" My Life
only mentions Lee's accusation in passing and does not again discuss Lee. Below are two passages from
Branch's book the first giving context and the second about the Terror Clause of the Crime Bill.
➢ The year closed on spies and terrorism. The Justice Department, after fierce debate among the security
agencies, indicted nuclear scientist Wen Ho Lee on fifty-nine counts of copying classified material to his
personal computer. Lee was being handled like a radioactive espionage defendant—no bail, lockdown,
solitary confinement—even though the long dragnet had produced no evidence that he offered secrets to
China or anyone else. The president said experts were telling him the worst spies sometimes stored their
treason for a rainy day. This sounded fishy to me. Clinton shrugged. Nothing would please him more
than to establish Lee's innocence. [Branch, 577]
➢ While Lee was indicted, Branch writes that WJC noted that others ""were being held in secret, uncharged
and untried...He [WJC] was embarrassed not to have sponsored this measure into law without
foreseeing such arbitrary detentions...Under the terrorist act, any prosecutor should decide within the
legal limit...whether to bring charges on the testimony of a secret informant or otherwise. To his
dismay, Clinton had learned of defendants held incommunicado for more than six months. One extreme
detention had last three years. 'I think it's wrong,' he [WJC] said. 'It's not American. We accept guilty
people on the street to enjoy and protect our freedom.' [Branch, 629]
WJC and Lewinsky's Silence
Branch writes that part of WJC's motive for not discussing what had happened with Lewinsky was that it could
send her to jail, as she had denied it.
➢ ""Also, he pointed out that Starr had been threatening to jail Lewinsky all year over her sworn denial of
the affair. If Clinton had come forward with anything at all about their relationship, he said Starr could
have turned him into a witness against Lewinsky, betraying her discreet silence. Such subtleties, while
original, struck me as tendentious. The president never claimed chivalry as the real motive for his
steadfast denial, nor did he dispute the essential truth of Lewinsky's account."" [Branch, 511]
HRC and Kissinger
The following could be fodder for people who want to continue to string along the notion of channeling Eleanor
Roosevelt.
➢ There is a passage in which HRC describes an exchange she had with Kissinger at a dinner where he
complained that if the health care bill passed he wouldn't be able to see his own doctor. She continued to
say ""it was interesting, in fact, that she had dreamed about Kissinger only a few nights before. His
visage turned suddenly effervescent at a banquet, announcing gladly that his worries were over because
the Clinton health care bill was dying. 'Oh, no, Dr. Kissinger,' she replied coolly. 'Don't be sure that it's
dead. We'll keep fighting, and there's always light at the end of the tunnel.' She said Kissing blanched,
speechless at her deft reminder of the Vietnam War...Now at last, in Hillary's dream, it registered that
his strategic designs had spewed carnage and venom for seven needless years...'That's what I dreamed,'
Hillary repeated, lost in thought. 'You know, I always get my revenge in dreams, but never in real life.'
[Branch, 179]
HRC and gay/lesbian
Writing about a call with HRC from NYS, Branch recalls how WJC's counsel got very ""exercised."" WJC left
the room. ""He was subdued on his return. 'You know, I've had a lot more contact with gay people in my life
than Hillary.' He sighed. Her temperament had a conservative, religious core, formed before homosexual issues
were even mentionable. New York politics was a tough crucible, and she was unsure what heat she could take.
On the other hand, personal experience could speed adaptation."" [Branch, 551]
Tension with Moynihan
There are several occasions throughout the book that Branch recalls WJC's grievances and frustration with
Moynihan. For example:
> When Moynihan called for the international arms embargo to be unilaterally lifted so that Bosnia could
fight for themselves, Branch writes, ""The president flinched when I mentioned [it]...'That's just a
freebie for him,' snapped Clinton, 'and he knows it.'"" [p.140]
> In regard to health care: ""Echoing comments by Hillary at dinner, he [WJC] faulted Senator Moynihan
for aimless hearings conducted without a strategy or theme."" [p.170]
➢ Discussing Independent Counsel: ""She [HRC] was especially scornful of the Democrats, and quoted a
number of them. Senator Moynihan, for instance, publicly said the Clintons were nice people and he was
sure they had nothing to hide. 'Why not have an investigation?' he often asked. She said Moynihan
skated blithely on the surface, never produced results in Congress, and could not withstand such scrutiny
himself for five minutes, living in an apartment secured through his chairmanship of the Pennsylvania
Avenue Development Corporation."" [Brach, 182]
➢ ""Donnybrook"" argument in which Moynihan said of a fundraising speech WJC gave citing a regretted
hypothetical about a controversial decision. Moynihan told the press, ""He doesn't understand...that he's
conceding the principles."" WJC confronted him about lack of context given to the statement to the press
and said that Moynihan knew what he was doing by ""feeding the beast of hostile presumption about
Clinton's motives."" [Branch, 299]
HRC as World Player
There are several images as HRC as a player on the world stage, both with WJC and on her own. Several
examples follow:
➢ Middle East: Discussing peace with King Hussein: ""They had retreated for lunch as two couples—the
Clintons, with the king and his wife, Queen Noor—in the family dining room... Their agenda was a
delicate race between Hussein's failing health and his desire to make peace with Israel. The president
said he and Hillary pounded away on symptoms of national estrangement: closed boarders, water
disputes, travel barriers, war grievances, contested airspace, sealed electrical grids, and so on. Hussein
gave them a feast of goodwill without commitment on any point."" [Branch, 170]
> South Asia: Regarding her trip to South Asia with CVC in 1995, ""Her [HRC's] schedule was far more
demanding than ceremonial, pushing both conflict resolution and civic empowerment for downtrodden
women."" [Branch, 236] Later Branch tells of Benazir Bhutto praising CVC and HRC. ""By contrast with
a superficial American press, which portrayed Hillary as a demure tourist of no policy significance in
exotic Asia, Bhutto said she had touched essential political chords with whirlwind encouragements for
citizenship groups and small-scale economic development."" (The note contrasting Bhutto corresponds to
a NYT article which Branch quotes in the footer saying, ""she [HRC] played the traditional role of First
Lady as wife and mother..."") [Branch, 246]
> China Speech: Branch outlines how HRC felt the speech needed to be bigger than China and how she
depicted the ""harsh reality everywhere"" from China to Africa. He then cites WJC commenting on the
rave reviews of HRC's speech. [Branch, 289]
➢ Regarding the Russian financial system meltdown, Branch writes ""Yeltsin seemed so removed from
urgent political tasks that both Clintons counseled him directly."" [Branch, 512-513]
Jesse Jackson
Branch writes about Jesse Jackson calling CVC after the Lewinsky story broke and having continued contact
with her throughout the period. WJC thanks him for his support of CVC. This goes into some detail about WJCs
gratitude, but the fact that Jackson ""counseled"" CVC has been public knowledge dating back to at least 1999.
➢ ""But now Jesse had done something he would not forget. When the Lewinsky news broke, he called
Chelsea at Stanford. Jesse was the only nonfamily adult with her cell phone number. How he got it was
another story. Jesse said he knew this was terrible for her. Nothing like it had ever happened in
American politics. He did not know everything involved, but he wanted to remind Chelsea how much
her parents loved her. Their family needed to stick together now above all, and if she needed to counsel,
rage, or pray, he was always available."" [Branch, 497]
Tension with Janet Reno
Throughout the book, from his nomination of her, WJC is portrayed as having no opinion to having a negative
opinion of Janet Reno.
> ""He complained about Janet Reno—made it clear, in fact, that he felt alienated from his own attorney
general. If he removed her, however, the pending decision on yet another special prosecutor [for 1996
campaign finance] would fall to Reno's deputy, Jamie Gorelick, who, Clinton feared, may share Reno's
wholesale devotion to outside control for any case in which the president himself may become a
target...If he removed both Reno and Gorelick, to start fresh, it would touch off a firestorm of protest
like Nixon's Saturday Night Massacre of the Justice Department officials during the Watergate scandal.
That was not an option."" [Branch, 388-389]
> Branch writes about WJC talking about Reno and Louis Freeh disregarding a letter from D'Amato and
continuing to allow independent counsel to go after Ciseneros. The same held true for Mike Espy.
Branch then outlines a meeting between WJC and Reno. Reno had made public statements about her
""desire to stay on the job. 'I told her I didn't like that one damn bit,' the president said tersely. 'I didn't
hire her to work for the New York Times and Washington Post. I hired her to work for me.'"" [Branch,
398] He continues to outline that Clinton did give Reno credit for some good achievements including
coordination with U.S. attorneys and that he didn't blame her for the special prosecutor on Whitewater,
but that ""he did blame her for abdicating responsibility to supervise the investigations ever since, letting
mandates multiply almost at will. She accepted criteria that were ludicrous and crassly partisan. Reno
had failed to defend the presidency itself—not Clinton personally, but the institution—and by extension
the entire executive branch...He told me she had no clue what he meant. His advisers considered her
more naïve than upright, and the fuzziness of the distinction seemed to save her."" [Branch, 399] He cites
that Clinton warned her that she should prepare herself for not staying in the job for the entire second
term.
Portrayal of Jimmy Carter
There are parallels that could be drawn between WJC/BHO and Carter/WJC both in terms of Carter's trip to
North Korea and the mission he went on to Haiti. WJC clearly was frustrated by Carter's seeming desire to be
on the front lines.
North Korea:
➢ ""On North Korea, he [WJC] said Jimmy Carter had initiated his own recent trip with a call to Al Gore,
and Clinton had approved the volunteer mission to break through North Korea's extreme
isolation... Sure enough, Carter did reach North Korean dictator Kim Il-sung, who proposed to allow
inspection of North Korea's nuclear facilities in exchange for relief from the harsh economic sanctions.
The only hitch was that Carter announced the terms on CNN before they became official, adding
gratuitously that he never had agreed with sanctions in the first place. News stories had the White House
seething, but Clinton made light of the spat. He said the deal was since ratified by an exchange of letters,
and he did not believe Carter would criticize official policy 'if the game were still in doubt.' [Branch,
162]
Haiti:
➢ After pushing to be sent to Haiti and enlisting Colin Powell and Sam Nunn to get WJC to break with
Gore (who said Carter shouldn't be trusted a second time) and Christopher and approve the mission to
Haiti to seek a truce with the junta, Carter is portrayed as acting stubbornly and having 'clientitis'
(arguing for acceptance of Haitian generals versus what was in the United States' best interest). He
didn't want to leave and WJC told him he had to. Like after North Korea, Carter again, Carter went to
the press first. ""The three negotiators flew back to Washington late Sunday, and Carter, invited to stay
over at the White House, called CNN's Judy Woodruff after midnight to arrange an interview the next
morning before he reported to Clinton on his mission. This conduct, the president said tersely, was not
right...The press was full of retrospective stories about friction between him and his three prominent
negotiators...He said the current newsweeklies lapped up criticism by Carter as an embarrassment to
Clinton...Many of his advisers griped that Jimmy Carter thought he was still president, but Clinton
found this criticism too jaundiced. Carter had spoken with restraint at their joint press conference, he
allowed, exhibiting a keen political ear...To Clinton, Carter simply felt that he had earned the right to
speak his mind as an international statesman, even about a mission he had accepted for the United States
government complete with an Air Force jet. This sense of entitlement could make Carter a thorn, but
Clinton thought his value far outweighed the political annoyance. He considered Carter a sterling ex-
resident."" [Branch, 200-201]
Dispatch of Bombers Near Iraq
➢ ""He expected military strikes to win bipartisan assent, including former presidents Ford, Reagan and
Bush. 'Dole will support me,' he said. 'Carter will probably criticize me. Carter always criticizes, but he
doesn't have much positive to say."" [Branch, 518]
Gore
For the majority of the book, there is little discussion of WJC and Gore's relationship. There are few places
where he is briefly mentioned and a couple of scenes with some levity. The end, however, describes the
seemingly brutally candid conversation between the two about the 2000 election and the impeachment.
➢ On page 92 Branch writes, ""No, he [Clinton] did not ask Gore to take over a failed foreign policy, as
alleged, but to improve public presentations by his troika of 'bad talkers': shy National Security Adviser
Tony Lake, boring Secretary of State Warren Christopher, and disorganized Defense Secretary Les
Aspin."" [Branch, 92]
➢ In one-passage WJC talks about asking Gore to lead the independent review of Hazel O'Leary and also
having Gore substitute for him at an economic conference in Japan. The latter did not fare well as other
nations were offended that Gore, not WJC attended. Gore insisted that WJC needed to go to Japan to
redeem himself and the administration for his absence. Gore pointed to a few days in January, but WJC
""pronounced them vital to Chelsea's schoolwork. Gore blinked. So what?...Mutual exasperation spiked.
`Al,' Clinton told him, 'I am not going to Japan and leave Chelsea by herself to take these exams.' Gore
erupted. He thought Clinton had lost his bearing. They had a big fight, said the president, and were still
wrangling about dates for Japan."" Branch states that this fight wound up being around the time WJC saw
Lewinsky. [Branch, 316-317]
➢ On page 396-397 there is a scene, which shows Gore's sense of humor and Gore, WJC, et al working as
a team to secure the Cabinet for the second term.
➢ Later there is a passage about an exchange between WJC and HRC about Gore trying to hire a second
criminal lawyer. HRC already knew he was paying the first one $30,000 per month. The conversation is
about a leak of an offer from Jim Neal of TN, the former Watergate prosecutor to defend Gore for free.
The exchange is more on ethics of the offer and its leak to the press than about Gore.
➢ On Gore's announcing his campaign. ""The president had called twice to congratulate Gore for his
kickoff events—once from Geneva, hours later from Paris. Clinton thought the only glitches were
technical... But Gore got all the big things right. His twofold message was perfect: distinguish himself
from Clinton's personal flaws, and tell voters exactly what he would do for them in the White House.
The president said it was fine for Gore to call Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky 'inexcusable.'
First, it was true. Second, it showed a necessary strength to criticized the boss. Third, Gore would be
badgered to death until he did. 'Al,' Clinton told him, 'if you thought it would help in the campaign, I
would let you flog me at noon right on the doorstep of the Washington Post.'"" [Branch, 553-554]
Branch continues that WJC told Gore to ignore reporting that he was offended or critical of his
campaign. ""On tape, the president said he confided his chief strategic worry only to Gore himself and to
Gore's pollster, Mark Penn. The vice president must project his platform—where he stood, precisely
how and where he would lead the country—because the Republicans would try to knock him off
substance."" [Branch, 554]
➢ WJC offered critiques of Gore's campaign throughout, but it was always framed as his fear of Gore not
succeeding him. For example, ""Clinton still thought Gore could win. Most people considered him smart,
experience, and motivated. He examined the pitfalls for Gore in a campaign showcasing presidential
character over detailed agendas for the country. Reporters called Gore ""stiff,"" but Clinton discounted
this liability. He thought Gore's droll sense of humor would wear well over time. Gore also was
perceived to be too conventional a Democrat, therefore lacking independence, which called for Gore to
emphasize more his own passion and initiatives. Then the president said Gore could have a brooding
quality about him, not worrisome or off-putting in itself, but potentially damaging if his serious nature
failed to give voters a lifted. Clinton isolated the word ""sunny."" Gore needed more of it."" [Branch, 599]
➢ He also complimented Gore's knowledge of government workings. ""Gore knew Washington. Believe
me, said the president, his administration would have made many more errors in the first two years had
it not been for the vice president."" He then goes on to say that WJC suggested Gore find someone who
would be a bright spot to run with, perhaps Durbin or Bradley or Kerrey, although he also goes into
great detail about the virtues of Mikulski, even though she would never get chosen. How much of this
was WJC's emphasis versus Branch's focus on his home state senator is unclear. [Branch, 599, 618-19]
➢ WJC criticized Gore for not running on the successes of the administration. ""They should be running
essentially for a third term, said the president, but they were afraid the Clinton-Gore record would
tarnish them with Clinton's character."" [Branch, 623] Branch gives WJC's critique of Gore in debate
that had been heard before—that Gore lacked style and a light touch.
➢ Branch has WJC recalling a conversation between WJC and Gore where ""Gore had bared himself in one
of their stressful consultations by insisting that he, Gore, was a good politician, elaborating that he
meant good on the policy, and also good on the politics, but admitted that he did not instinctively blend
the two. Gore said he had to think about it, and Clinton thought this was pretty close to the bone...He
had the stuff to be a great president, and this was the message that Clinton must convey somehow
without seeming to brag on his own record."" [Branch, 623-624]
➢ The big passage about Gore begins on page 641 and extends to 645. Branch notes that WJC was unsure
at first about recording the details. At the outset it says, ""For his own part, Gore was not angry, nor did
he blame Clinton for his defeat, but he wanted to acknowledge forthrightly that some people around him
did."" [Branch, 642] It has WJC acknowledging that Gore's use of him was proper—he was best in the
White House. Then he says, ""'I think you made a mistake not to use me more in the last ten days,'""
Clinton told Gore, 'but otherwise that was not a big deal. I was much more upset about your message,
now that we're being honest.'"" [Branch, 642] Branch recalls WJC saying Gore fought bag saying that
""Clinton's drag plagued every direction."" Clinton then said that Gore was better at governance than
Clinton, and Gore would be better for the nation than Bush, and that he was an ""unparalleled"" vice
president, but that he had ""blind spots."" Branch writes that WJC kept saying their confrontation was
""surreal.""
o Gore had a ""fresh grievance...he wanted Clinton to know that the Buddhist temple fund-raising
scandal had been the worst experience of his life. No one had ever questioned his personal
integrity, but corrosive publicity and whispers had tormented him now for four years. Gore said
he had not been disposed to blame Clinton. However, he remembered telling the president that
he found himself the only English-speaking person at one of those Asian fund-raisers. And the
president was in charge of the party apparatus that was supposed to screen all the donations for
trouble. So he did blame Clinton in a way. The president told me he could scarcely believe the
ensuing tales of suspicion. Gore must still be in shock from the election, or unhinged. 'I thought
he was in Neverland,' he said."" [Branch, 643-644]
o Branch continues: ""The vice president asked Clinton about Monica Lewinsky. He had supported
Clinton all through the impeachment, publicly and privately, while declaring himself
disappointed. Yes, said the president. He appreciated that. However, persisted Gore, Clinton did
not confide any personal feelings. He never explained exactly what happened. There was little to
say, Clinton replied, beyond failure and regret. He was humiliated and angry, had made mistake.
He had misled the American people, and he was sorry. Gore closed his point with emphasis.
Well, he said, this is the first time you have apologized to me personally. Clinton did a double
take...Gore treated the confession as a watershed. Their colliding perspectives made both of
them angry. Clinton exploded that Gore's reaction was phony. What was so significant
here?...Gore exploded back. He was feeling a stubborn repeat of the defensiveness and delayed
honesty that somehow cost the election. Clinton's character was at the root of it..."" [Branch,

➢ Maggie as Person Recommending Panetta: Unlike in My Life, in Branch's book, it has WJC asking
Maggie to compile confidential suggestions for McLarty's replacement. ""Williams was shrewd, discreet,
and efficient."" [Branch, 161]
> HRC and Haiti Invasion: Branch asked WJC what HRC thought about his foreign policy team's
suggestion to invade Haiti. ""He said the pell-mell rush to invade was crazy to her. Reacting against the
pressure, the lack of options, and his sense of being trapped, she said he was badly served by his foreign
policy staff. He said she observed with some suspicion that the chief sponsors of the invasion—Lake,
Berger, and Talbott—were the same people who had pushed the ill-fated appointment of Bobby Ray
Inman as defense secretary."" [Branch, 189]
> ITAV: ITAV co-author flap in which Sally Quinn spread rumors that HRC had not written the book.
Quinn said that HRC had denied credit to the book's collaborator, Barbara Feinman, a friend of Quinn.
HRC said Feinman had withdrawn from the project. Branch notes that the White House had draft
chapters in HRC's handwriting. (Branch turned this to be about him and how it affected him as a
ghostwriter.) From this HRC said that Quinn and her friends launched a rumor that HRC and a female
veterinarian of Socks' were ""discovered...in flagrante on a bedroom floor in the White House."" [Branch,

subpoenaed all those who might have been in the White House when HRC's Rose firm records were
there. This included ""some two dozen of Chelsea's sleepovers."" Senator Sarbanes quashed the

best chance to defeat Bush for the White House. 'Hands down,' he [WJC] said, tut I don't think Al

> WJC suggesting Rubin run for NY Senate seat: The passage comes after WJC talks about supporting
HRC if she decided to run, which raises a question of whether he had preferred Rubin or whether the
two events are unconnected. ""When the president had urged him [Rubin] to run for and easily win the
New York Senate seat, Rubin recoiled...He could not fathom why Hillary wanted to run now...""

3090,"Devin and I wandered into a corner of the health care debate on Saturday in the Post....Counseling That Helps the Dying Live
By Devin Talbott and Strobe Talbott
Saturday, August 29, 2009
Many opponents of health-care reform have concentrated their fire on a provision in House
legislation that would provide for government reimbursement to doctors who offer end-of-life
counseling. How our society deals with those confronting death is understandably controversial.
Unfortunately, the debate has degenerated into a cacophony of demagoguery and distortion,
including invocations of Hitler and fear-mongering about ""death panels."" As a result of these
attacks, a number of senators who are key to determining what bill will emerge from Congress
have abandoned support for end-of-life counseling.
Our family's experience this year provided a vivid perspective on the value of that service and
the misguidedness of the campaign against it. Brooke Shearer -- wife, mother and grandmother
-- had been fighting cancer for more than a year. She had undergone major surgery, numerous
scans and biopsies, and two debilitating courses of chemotherapy. Her doctors were among the
best in their fields. Their expertise did not, however, extend to the fine points of, and latest
advances in, pain management.
Brooke was determined to maintain the highest possible quality of her own life and that of her
family for whatever time we had together. With that goal in mind, she sought advice and
treatment from palliative-care specialists at Washington Home and Community Hospices. Their
ingenuity and skill in adjusting her medications significantly alleviated her discomfort in her
final months. Working closely with her primary physicians, the hospice staff helped Brooke
anticipate the likely course of her disease in a way that allowed her to make decisions and
exercise a degree of control over both her own condition and our family's adjustment to it.
When her oncologist concluded that chemotherapy was not working, Brooke put herself fully
into the hands of Washington Home as an outpatient. Regular house calls by hospice doctors,
nurses and social workers enabled her to stay active on professional projects, spend time with
friends and family, and end her life at home, which was a considerable comfort to her and to us.
These, not issues of cost, were the principal considerations for our family. However, controlling
the cost of health care -- especially in the last year of life -- is an important part of the current
national debate. Therefore it is worth noting that Brooke's treatment in the last stages of her
illness was far less expensive than it had been in the previous year.
It has often been said that dying can be a full-time job. That was emphatically not the case with
Brooke. Until her final days, she concentrated on living -- a choice that end-of-life counseling
helped make possible. Hospice care more than meets the standard of the Hippocratic oath: It not
only does no harm -- it does good; it is not about hastening death but enhancing life. If
counseling about hospice services and palliative care is a beneficiary of health care reform,
many Americans will be as well.

Reasonable people can disagree on whatever it was
By Al Kamen
Monday, October 19, 2009
They call it the World's Greatest Deliberative Body (WGDB), Part I.
The Senate Judiciary Committee last week was reviewing an amendment by Sen. Richard Durbin (D-I11.) to the
USA Patriot Act to clarify the legal standard needed for an investigation under the act. The amendment was
intended to provide greater protections from abuse by investigators.
His colleague, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), spoke in opposition, agreeing with committee Chairman Patrick
Leahy (D-Vt.) and ranking Republican Jeff Sessions (Ala.) that additional protections are not needed.
""I would just point to the actual language in here,"" Klobuchar said, ""which is, it's not like this is some pie-in-
the-sky standard here. I mean, it specifically says,"" she noted approvingly, reading aloud from the bill, that there
have to be ""reasonable grounds to believe that the information sought is relevant to an authorized national
security investigation,"" and you can't investigate someone just for exercising free speech rights and there's got
to be some suspected foreign agent involved.
""So I just, for anyone listening to this, it is not like there is no standard,"" she concluded. ""There is a standard in
place here.""
""That's the standard that is in the bill now?"" Sessions asked.
Klobuchar nodded that it was.
No it's not, Durbin interrupted. ""Senator Klobuchar, you just read my amendment,"" not the bill, he said -- ""and I
think it's critically important that you understand what we're establishing here.""
Whatever. Klobuchar voted against the amendment, which got only a handful of votes anyway.
Blame the gatekeeper
The usual pattern at the State Department is that the new secretary arrives at Foggy Bottom for the first day of
work and enters to rousing cheers from career Foreign Service folks hoping the new boss will actually heed
their expert advice. (They are, by nature, an optimistic crowd.)
Then, after 7 months, 8 days and 12 hours, on average, the grumbling begins that the secretary is ""not
accessible"" to senior career folks, that she's overly protected by her personal staff, that the promised ""open
door"" has slammed shut. The fingers start pointing, usually at the secretary's chief of staff. These days, that's
Cheryl Mills, who holds that post for Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton.
We're hearing complaints even from members of the inner circle that the overworked Mills -- chief of staff,
counselor, overseer of Haiti policy and food security policy and the department motor pool (okay, not really) --
has made entry to Clinton's suite something like penetrating the Green Zone in Baghdad.
Not so, says Undersecretary of State William Burns, the department's top career official. ""This secretary is in
touch every day with as many people across the department as possible, and Cheryl is a big part of making that
happen.""
Another senior State official said Clinton has been on the road a lot: Asia in July and Africa in August and
Ireland and Moscow just the other day, and soon she'll be back on the road, pretty much until Thanksgiving.
There have also been a bunch of meetings of late on AfPak matters.
Hey, just telling you what we're hearing.
In a timely fashion ...
The Loop Better-Late-Than-Never award this year goes to the State Department's personnel bureau. The bureau,
in an Oct. 13 notice, said it had awarded a $1.6 million contract to Campion Services Inc. in West Lafayette,
Ind., to ""assist the department in ensuring that all examinations for Foreign Service [jobs] have been
professionally validated and constitute a reliable means of identifying those applicants with the greatest
possibility of success in the foreign service.""
Well, good thing the department's only been hiring for a couple of hundred years.
The rest of the résumé
The White House last week announced that President Obama had selected Jessie H. Roberson, a nuclear expert
and senior vice president of environmental affairs for the Atlantic Sea Island Group, to be a member of the
Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board. The bio notes her previous jobs, even her undergraduate degree in
nuclear engineering.
Name sounds familiar. Roberson, Roberson: Wasn't she Dubya's appointee as assistant secretary of the Energy
Department for environmental management, the $6 billion-a-year weapons cleanup program? That's not
mentioned in the White House release, but she was there from 2001 to 2004.
Waterboarding for kids?
WGDB, Part II: Sen. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) must be feeling stressed these days over the travails of his pal, Sen.
John Ensign (R-Nev.). For those who missed it, Coburn took to the Senate floor last week to decry federal
deficits, which are not, for him, an abstraction.
""It is deeply personal with me,"" Coburn explained. ""I have five grandchildren. I look in their eyes, and I see the
potential of their lives and all of these other children who are out there. You know what? We are going to
waterboard them. That is what we are going to do. We are going to waterboard them. We are going to flood
them with debt. We are going to shackle their opportunities. We are going to limit their possibilities because we
don't have the courage to make the difference for their future.""
Wait a minute! It's just a dunk in the water.

We will meet with her this morning at 10 am to brief her for Tuesday's journey to Honduras. At this point, it appears we
have a military aircraft available. The plan is for the U.S. Delegation to depart D.C., stop in Miami to pick up Ricardo

about our commitment to seeing this process through to a successful conclusion.
You should be aware that Ambassador Hugo Llorens is under public assault. The Wall Street Journal dedicates its

I suggest a night at the theatre, Mr Cameron
A sop to the party's Europhobes has left the Conservative leader defending the indefensible. He should be
ashamed
David Aaronovitch
On Friday morning David Cameron called upon David Miliband to apologise. On Friday evening I went to see a play. The
play was Our Class, by the Polish playwright, Tadeusz Slobodzianek.
In a series of short ""chapters"" Slobodzianek followed a group of classmates in a small Polish village from 1925 to 2002.
Like the village, the class was half Catholic and half Jewish. In 1941, as the Germans replaced the Russians as the
occupiers, almost all the Jews of the area were murdered in a single day. Slobodzianek shows what led up to the
massacre and what happened afterwards. It is unbearable.
Though the village is not named in the play, it is based on real events that took place at Jedwabne on July 10, 1941. As
Poland's Institute of National Memory concluded in 2002, on that day 40-50 Jewish men were forced to parade around the
town singing songs, and were then led to a barn on the outskirts where, one by one, they were killed with knives, axes
and cleavers and then thrown in a pit. Then 300 or more women and children were led from the town square to the barn
and locked inside. Kerosene was poured over the roof and walls and set alight. The screams could be heard from two
kilometres away; no one survived.
In 2001 it was finally acknowledged what many people had known all along. The murderers hadn't been Germans, but
local Poles, as depicted in Our Class. Alexander Kwasniewski, then the Polish President, apologised to the dead Jews
and their survivors at a ceremony in Jedwabne ""in my own name, and in the name of those Poles whose conscience is
shattered by that crime"".
History matters. Few believe that as much as the Law and Justice party of Michel Kaminski, who leads the Tory-backed
group in the European Parliament. The party's leaders have demanded apologies from the Russians for the massacre of
21,000 Polish officers at Katyn in 1940 and their references to terrible Polish historical suffering have constituted a big
part, of their political appeal.
But despite his historical sensitivity Mr Kaminski, the MEP for the Jedwabne area, did not support the 2001 apology. He
opposed it vigorously, associating himself with the ""Committee to Defend the .Good Name of Jedwabne"". Among its
leading members were the local priest, Edward Orlowski, who — asked by journalists whether he would be attending the
ceremony at which the President apologised — said: ""These are all lies. it is not my business. Germans are responsible,
so why should we apologiSe?""
Mr Kaminski developed a slightly different rationale. As he told an interviewer for a far-right newspaper, Our Poland, the
murders — which he abhorred — were the work of a few outcasts, and that he would only apologise if someone ""from the
Jewish side"" apologised for how ""the Jews"" behaved during the Soviet occupation from 1939 to 1941. Last month Mr
Kaminski (who had denied giving the interview) confirmed this position. ""If you are asking the Polish nation to apologise
for the crime made in Jedwabne,"" he said, ""you would require the whole Jewish nation to apologise for what some Jewish
communists did in Eastern Poland.""
It is this argument that so incenses me,•as it would anyone, I think, who had sat through Our Class. The idea of collective
Jewish Bolshevism was a major anti-Semitic trope before the war; it was a major element of self-justification after it.
Mr Kaminski denied the apology, denied the need for it, equated the massacre to ""Jewish actions"" and allied himself with
those who denied the massacre altogether, fulfilling the historian Pierre Vidal-Naquet's observation about patterns of
massacre denial: ""it never happened, it happened but was justified, they did it to themselves, they did it to us."" Mr
Kaminski's view was described as disgraceful by Mr Miiiband. Having read an enormous amount on Jedwabne in the last
few weeks, I think Mr Miliband is completely right — it is disgraceful. And as he might well demand of Mr Cameron: ""I
should apologise?""
But more than that, I find myself amazed by how Mr Cameron ever came to be in the position of demanding that a foreign
secretary, descended from Polish Jews, should apologise for possibly offending the sensibilities of a foreign politician who
vehemently opposed there being an apology for the massacre of Polish Jews. I think of all the things that Mr Cameron has
got right in his leadership of the. Conservatve Party and my mental jaw drops at the sheer wrongness of it.
Now Tory columnists, bioggers and activists are devoting their time to nitpicking sophistry about the nature of collective
guilt, and to attacking non-existent ""smears"" that they say have been attached to the unlovely person of Mr Kaminski.
Why?
It is true, as embattled Conservatives have argued, that many of the grand European coalitions contain people whose
history is problematic. There are odds and sods in the big conservative grouping, the EPP, and in the socialist group. But
these personalities are far outweighed by the parties of the IVIerkels and Sarkozys. The Polish member of the EPP, for
example, is the ruling free-market, non-nationalist conservative party of Donald Tusk — almost certainly the party that Mr
Cameron would join if he were a Pole. The new Tory grouping, the European Conservatives and Reformists, by contrast,
is all about odds and sods whom a continental Cameron would certainly shun, bar one organisation — the British
Conservatives.
So why get yourself into a position where you have to explain that the Latvian SS wasn't so bad really, and that Mr
Kaminski has an understandable position on collective guilt? And the answer seems to be that Mr Cameron promised his
Europhobes in his leadership campaign back in 2005 that he would leave the ""federalist"" EPP, and that the logical
outcome of this move has been the weird alliance that he now finds himself defending.
Was it all necessary? No. Was it in Britain's interests? Absolutely not. is it in the interests of progressive Conservatism?
You must be joking. So has this happened because Mr Cameron doesn't really care enough about Europe to think
through the consequences of his own lightly given promises, or because he's just as much a Euro-nutter as those sects,
the Hannanites, the Cashists and the Redwoodians?
This is the kind of advice I loathe, but I'll say it anyway. Go to see Our Class, Mr C. This is one hole you don't want to
keep digging.","['Jedwabne', 'Poland', 'Jedwabne', 'Katyn', 'Jedwabne', 'Jedwabne', 'Poland', 'Jedwabne', 'Eastern', 'Poland', 'Jedwabne', 'Britain', 'Europe']"

France: 'Autistic Tories have castrated UK in
Europe'
French Europe minister says David Cameron's pledge to reclaim EU powers is 'pathetic' and will leave Britain isolated
Nicholas',Nat, Patrick yVintpur and :15;rattori.
c.,uardiari.,;:o.uk, Wednesday 4 November 2009 21.30 GMT
The Cohseri?t,vea were accused by the French government tonight of ""castrating"" Britain's position within the EU by
adopting an ""autistic"" approach that would take Britain off the radar.
Speaking to the Guardian, Pierre Lellouche, France's Europe minister, described as ""pathetic"" the Tories' EU plans
announced today, warning they would not succeed ""for a minute"".
Giving vent to frustration across the EU, which has so'far only been expressed in private, Lellouche — who said he was
reflecting Nicolas Sarkozy's ""sadness and regret"" — accused William Hague, the shadow foreign secretary, of a ""bizarre
autism"" in their discussions.
He said: ""They have one line and they just repeat one line. It is a very bizarre sense of autism.""
Lellouche, one of the most Anglophile members of Sarkozy's government, made his remarkable intervention after David
Caii.e.con outlined a fresh Tory approach to the EU in the wake of the full ratification of the Lisbon treaty.
A future Conservative government would seek to strengthen British sovereignty and repatriate a series of powers Over
social and employment legislation, the Tory leader said.
Cameron said he was not seeking an immediate ""bust-up"" with the EU, and would allow the repatriation of powers
negotiations to last as long as five years.
But that position was not enough for the Tory MEP Daniel Hannan, who quit his role as the party's legal affairs spokesman
in Europe, saying he intended to fight for referendums to enable Britain to become ""self-governing"".
France's centre-right government condemned Cameron's plans, saying that they would marginalise Britain within the EU.
Abandoning all diplomatic niceties, Lellouche said: ""It's pathetic. It's just very sad to see Britain, so important in Europe,
just cutting itself out from the rest and disappearing from the radar map .... This is a culture of opposition ... It is the result
of a long period of opposition. I know they will come back, but I hope the trip will be short."" He said Cameron's approach
was in line with the Tories' decision to abandon the main centre-right EPP grouping in the European parliament, of which
Sarkozy's UMP party is a member.
""They are doing what they have done in the European parliament. They have essentially castrated your UK influence in
the European parliament,"" he said.
Lellouche said he has told Hague personally that his position was a ""waste of time for all of us"".
""I have told William Hague: go away for two to three years, in your political economic situation you're going to be all by
your self and you'll come back. Go ahead and do it. That is my message to them ... You want to be marginalised? Well,
you go for it. But it's a waste of time for all of us,"" the French minister said.
Lellouche made clear the Tories had no hope of securing support for their plans. ""It's not going to happen for a minute.
Nobody is going to indulge in rewriting [treaties for] many, many years. Nobody is going to play with the institutions again.
It's going to be take it or leave it and they should be honest and say that,"" he said. ""It is a time of tumultuous waters all
around us. Wars, terrorism, proliferation, Afghanistan, energy with Russia, massive immigration, economic crisis. It is time
when the destiny of Europe is being defined — whether or not we will exist as a third of the world's GDP capable of fighting
it out on climate, on trade, on every ... issue on the surface of the Earth.
""We need to be united, otherwise we will be wiped out and marginalised. None of us can do it alone. Whether you're big
or small, the lessbn is the same. And [Britain's] risk is one of marginalisation. Irrelevance."" He explained: ""Finally we have
institutional package, but it took 15 years of looking at our navel and getting everybody bored to death with sterile debate"".
In a sign of France's determination to resist the Tory plans to opt out of key EU legislation, Lellouche warned the French
would attempt to reduce Britain's EU budget rebate which will be up for negotiation during the next parliament.
He pointed out that France is a net EU contributor to the tune of €5bn (E4.5bn), unlike Britain which receives a rebate.
""If we get a government that is ferociously anti European that will vote down this kind of legislation then I think the
relationship is going to be very difficult. As we enter the next phase one of the issues we have to discuss midterm is of
course finances. France is a net contributor to the tune of €5bn a year, of which €1.5bn is the same as British rebate. That
should tell you quite a bit huh?"" he said.
Cameron will be angered by the attack, and what it implies for Tory relations with the rest of Europe although in the short
term he will be more concerned to ensure his strategy of abandoning a referendum on the Lisbon treaty does not provoke
cries, of betrayal on his backbenches.
Hague reacted to the French criticism by insisting that Lellouche's comments did not represent the true reception of the
Tories' plans in Europe.
""That is not how we are seen across Europe,"" he told BBC2's Newsnight, adding his party had established good relations
with Sarkozy's party.
""1 don't think you will find that's representative of the reaction in Paris or other European capitals,"" he added.","['UK', 'Europe', 'Britain', 'Britain', 'Britain', 'France', 'Europe', 'Lisbon', 'Europe', 'Britain', 'France', 'Britain', 'Britain', 'Europe', 'UK', 'Afghanistan', 'Russia', 'Europe', 'Earth', 'Britain', 'France', 'Britain', 'France', 'Britain', 'France', 'Europe', 'Lisbon', 'Europe', 'Europe', 'Paris']"

Hillary's Moment: Clinton Faces the World
By Joe Klein
Time Magazine
Wednesday, Nov. 04, 2009
It was Halloween night in Jerusalem, and Benjamin Netanyahu came dressed as a peacemaker. ""We're prepared to start
peace talks immediately,"" the notoriously reluctant Israeli Prime Minister proclaimed, with U.S. Secretary of State Hillary
Clinton standing at his side, poker-faced. ""I think we should ... get on it and get with it.""
It was a ploy, of course. The Palestinians were tangled up in themselves, yet again. They had elections looming, and their
leader, Mahmoud Abbas, had to hang tough: he was demanding a total freeze to Israeli settlement-building on the West
Bank — which was precisely what the Obama Administration had previously said it favored. Netanyahu was offering a
partial freeze, not including new settlements in East Jerusalem, the desired capital of a future Palestinian state. This was
a nonstarter for the Palestinians, but it had the holographic glow of a step forward. It was an ""unprecedented"" offer,
Netanyahu trumpeted, with the joy of a chess master springing a trap.(See photos from 60 years of Israel.)
It was a tough moment for Clinton, playing second fiddle at the Bibi-does-Gandhi show. President Barack Obama had
softened his language on the settlements a few weeks earlier: instead of a total freeze, he had talked about Israeli
""restraint"" in settlement-building. And now Clinton seemed to cement the Administration's retreat, agreeing that
Netanyahu's proposal was, indeed, ""unprecedented,"" even though the U.S. still favored a total freeze. The most
important thing, she added, was for the parties to get to the table as quickly as possible. The onus was back on the
Palestinians — and the Palestinians quickly expressed outrage at the Obama Administration's retreat. Their Arab
neighbors soon joined in, causing Clinton to backtrack two days later, telling reporters the Israeli plan ""falls far short"" of
U.S. expectations, although she still insisted on calling it ""unprecedented,"" which was neither diplomatic nor wise.
Suddenly the Obama Administration seemed wobbly on the Middle East; clearly, Clinton had been too bullish on
Netanyahu's proposal (which had been negotiated over months with Middle East envoy George Mitchell and was seen,
privately, by the Americans as real progress). But the Administration's mission was to get the parties into peace talks
without preconditions. The Israelis were now in favor of talks. The Palestinians were setting preconditions. And Clinton
had violated an essential rule of her job: boring is almost always better.(See photos from the life and career of former
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.)
Clinton's Three Qualities
For the past 40 years, the awkward Middle East press conference has helped define the job of Secretary of State. You go
to Jerusalem or Ramallah; you stand there ""guardedly optimistic"" in public; in private, you try to move a comma, but the
Israelis or Palestinians move, a semicolon to block your comma. The result is almost always the same: gridlock. The
breakthroughs, when they come, emanate from others. Walter Cronkite asks Anwar Sadat if he'd be willing to go to
Jerusalem ... and Sadat, to everyone's surprise, says yes. The Israelis and Palestinians hold secret meetings in Oslo and
reach what appears to be a breakthrough — they're talking! — which then becomes another dead end.
The job of Secretary of State is more thankless than glamorous; in some ways, the Department of State, a noble antique,
is still trying to come to terms with the invention of the telephone. In an era when Twitter haiku-messaging rules,
diplomacy moves at the speed, and requires the nuanced complexity, of literature. Power has drifted from State to the
National Security Council and the Pentagon, especially in wartime. Only a few of Clinton's recent predecessors have
distinguished themselves. Henry Kissinger, a National Security Adviser who belatedly became Secretary of State, was
Richard Nixon's schizophrenic alter ego; George Shultz was a strong policy voice in the Reagan Administration; James
Baker had clout because he was George H.W. Bush's best friend and a world-class dealmaker. Most of the others have
been frustrated or forgettable. And yet this is Hillary Clinton we're talking about — the second most popular American in
the world, an eternally compelling and supremely talented character, the subject of constant speculation, a walking
headline. Her very presence in the job makes it crucial once more.
It is a cliché to say that by naming Clinton, Obama brought his most popular potential opponent into the tent. The
conventional wisdom, too cynical by half, is that he thereby succeeded in neutering her, a theory bolstered by Clinton's
reticence during her first nine months on the job, with special envoys like Mitchell and Richard Holbrooke doing the
heavy lifting of diplomacy. But by naming Clinton, Obama also gave her great power, which cuts both ways: if she
becomes dissatisfied with her role or the Administration's policies, she can become a torpedo aimed at the Oval Office.
Colin Powell had similar power and a real gripe — the Iraq war — but never used it. Clinton has no such gripe, but as the
Obama Administration settles in and policy differences begin to emerge among the key players, the Powell conundrum
looms: How will Clinton choose to use her power? How will Obama react if and when she does?
Traditionally, the Secretary of State is judged on his or her ability to formulate policy, negotiate deals and manage the
striped-pants bureaucracy. Clinton has no history as a global strategist, although her performance in the 2008 campaign
indicates that she is a bit more conservative than the President, more the foreign policy realist than the Wilsonian
idealist. It is also too early to judge her skill as a manager or negotiator — although her performance in Jerusalem
indicates that she needs a few lessons in Middle East Haggling 101.
There are, however, three qualities that could make her a memorable Secretary of State. She brings a vision of
departmental reform — the need to elevate foreign aid programs to the same status and rigorous scrutiny as diplomacy
— that could change striped pants into chinos in the developing world. She is also the first elected politician to hold the
office since Edmund Muskie briefly did during the Carter Administration, which has enabled her to better understand
and interact with the politicians who run places like Afghanistan and Pakistan. But most important, she is an
international celebrity with a much higher profile than any of her recent predecessors and the ability — second only to
the President's — to change negative attitudes about the U.S. abroad.
She has the potential to become the most powerful public diplomat the U.S. has fielded in quite some time, although
her performance so far, at home and abroad, has occasionally been perplexing. At home, she has often seemed
tentative and deferential. In a conversation with Secretary of Defense Robert Gates aired by CNN in early October,
Clinton's cautious formality took a backseat to Gates' brisk, humorous confidence on policy issues. Abroad, she seems
far more confident, at times to the point of recklessness, as in Jerusalem. (See photos of the last days of Hillary Clinton's
campaign.)
Independence and Candor
In the last week of October, Secretary Clinton moved squarely to the center of the world stage, attempting, at the
behest of her special envoys, to improve the rocky alliance with Pakistan and nudge the Middle East pugilists into talks.
In the course of the trip, there were the first stray wisps of a hint that Clinton wanted to begin asserting her
independence, as the Administration, facing roadblocks across the world, struggled for a firmer foreign policy tone after
an opening nine months that might be called the Rodney King — ""Can't we all just get along?"" — phase.
During her three days in Pakistan, she ran a gauntlet of town-hall meetings and media interviews that may have been
unprecedented, to use the word of the week, for a U.S. Secretary of State. The trip, planned by Holbrooke and Pakistan
specialist Vali Nasr, offered an unusually subtle itinerary for a U.S. diplomatic mission. A visit to a Sufi mosque that had
been bombed by Sunni extremists, for example, sent a powerful message to Pakistan's moderate Islamic majority. ""We
saw her praying there,"" an academic named Shala Aziz told me, ""and, for the first time, I'm thinking, The Americans have
hearts.""(See photos of the suicide bombings in Islamabad.)
The big news was that Clinton allowed herself to be hammered with hostile questions from students, talk-show hosts
and Pashturi elders -- and that, on occasion, she pushed back, raising incredibly sensitive issues, like why no one in the
Pakistani government knew where Osama bin Laden was, even though he had been in the country since 2002. Press
accounts either emphasized the embarrassment of a Secretary of State's getting pummeled or fixed on Clinton's
undiplomatic bluntness. But they missed the point: her candor, her willingness to listen to and acknowledge criticism,
had begun to undermine the prevailing Pakistani image of the U.S. as arrogant and bossy, more interested in having the
Pakistani military fight its war against al-Qaeda and the Taliban than in having a true strategic partnership. The contrast
was especially sharp after George W. Bush's eight years of unqualified support for the military dictatorship of Pervez
Musharraf. ""In the past, when the Americans came, they would talk to the generals and go home,"" said Farahnaz
Ispahani, a government spokeswoman and Member of Parliament. ""Clinton's willingness to meet with everyone, hostile
or not, has made a big impression — and because she's Hillary Clinton, with a real history of affinity for this country, it
means so much more.""
Transformative Experience
There are no toasts at state dinners in Pakistan, because there is no alcohol. There are opening statements, though, and
Clinton's — delivered impromptu on the first night of her trip after tossing aside her notes — was surprisingly emotional.
Earlier in the day, President Asif Ali Zardari, the widower of Benazir Bhutto, had presented the Secretary with an album
of photos from her first visit to Pakistan, in 1995, and a framed photo of Bhutto and her two sons with Clinton and
daughter Chelsea. ""It did bring tears to my eyes,"" Clinton said at the state dinner in her honor at the presidential palace,
""because I so admired your wife. She gave her life ..."" She faltered then, choking up, but quickly pulled herself together,
talking about the ""reasons why we do what we do — to provide opportunities for all.""
Clinton's first trip to Pakistan as First Lady in 1995 had been a transformative experience for her — the beginning, I
believe, of the•process that made her a plausible candidate for Secretary of State. I traveled with her on that trip; when
we set off, she seemed depressed and even more private than usual. The Democrats had cratered in the 1994
congressional elections, and she had been trounced in her efforts to enact a universal health care plan. It was a very
personal defeat; as Clinton traveled the country trying to sell the plan, crowds shouted her down and cursed her.
Privately she admitted she was shocked by the hatred. The trip to South Asia seemed a bit of a vacation — it was
Chelsea's spring break — but also a retreat to a more demure, First Lady–like role after two years as health care policy
czar, although it proceeded in a decidedly wonky, Hillarian fashion. Jackie Kennedy had gone to India and famously
ridden an elephant; Hillary Clinton traveled to five countries and packed her schedule with visits to NGOs.
""That was the greatest trip, just unbelievable,"" Clinton says now. We were sitting in her hotel suite the day after her
Jerusalem gaffe, the Secretary in an electric-blue shift rather than her usual formal jacket and pants. She was wearing
glasses and appeared rather freckly without her makeup. ""I guess that trip has animated and informed everything I've
done since,"" she said. She emerged from the trip reinvigorated, with a new mission. By the end of 1995, at the U.N.
Conference on Women in Beijing, the First Lady had propounded a new Clinton Doctrine: ""Women's rights are human
rights.""(See photos of Beijing's changing skyline.)
Clinton is not an easy interview. She is preternaturally cautious, a consequence of her Methodist propriety and 20 years
of insane public scrutiny. She does not like to talk about herself, but she did tell me one interesting story about Bhutto.
When her husband was governor of Arkansas, she and Bill and Chelsea visited London and stood on the sidewalk outside
Bhutto's hotel, waiting for the then Pakistani Prime Minister to arrive. ""She was wearing a yellow embroidered shalwar
kameez with a chiffon scarf. I was just a fan, standing on the sidewalk with everyone else. It was the only time I ever did
anything like that,"" Clinton says.
When Clinton and Bhutto met formally, on the first day of the 1995 trip, they hit it off immediately, in part because
Bhutto was also obsessed with the impact the Islamist tide was having on women and children. I remember asking
Bhutto that day what the biggest change in her country had been over the past 25 years, and she said, ""I used to be able
to walk down the street wearing jeans, without a headscarf. Now I can't."" When I asked her why, she said — bluntly —
""The Saudis,"" who had been aggressively funding religious schools. Of course, Bhutto's acquiescence to, and
participation in, the general corruption of the Pakistani government was part of the reason public schools were so
inadequate and madrasahs became popular. (See photos from the aftermath of Benazir Bhutto's assassination in 2007.)
Ironically, the rise of Sunni extremist groups like al-Qaeda has brought Clinton's interests — microfinance, education and
health care — to the center of national-security policy for the first time. The impetus came not from the State
Department but from the military, where counterinsurgency doctrine demanded that social services in war zones -
schools, justice, economic development — reinforce the military's efforts to secure the population. As a result, there
was immediate chemistry between Clinton and General David Petraeus, author of the Army's counterinsurgency
manual, who became one of her prime military mentors when she served on the Senate Armed Services Committee. At
one point, well before Obama made his presidential intentions known, I asked Petraeus if there was any potential
Democratic candidate who understood how his mind worked, and he said, ""You mean, aside from Hillary?""
It was Clinton who brought together Petraeus and Holbrooke (""my two alpha males,"" she calls them) for the first time -
at her home in Washington on the Friday before the Obama Inauguration. The affection and respect she gained for the
military while serving in the Senate has helped make the relationship between State and the Pentagon less fraught than
usual — although Defense Secretary Gates' insistence on the need for bigger State Department budgets hasn't hurt. In
fact, relations with the Pentagon have gone smoother, at times, than Clinton's relationship with the White House staff.
Clinton was particularly irritated by the ridiculously strict vetting process that thwarted her favored candidate for USAID
director, Paul Farmer, from getting the job. ""It was all sorts of niggling things,"" says a Clinton adviser, ""like, Farmer had
at one point brought more than $10,000 in cash into Haiti. The money was for a needle-exchange program, but the
amount was illegal.""
Another of Clinton's military mentors, retired General Jack Keane, once told me, ""I'm a Republican. I disagree with her
about practically everything, but she'd make a hell of a Commander in Chief."" There is a palpable toughness to the
woman, a hard edge that contrasts with the President's instinctive impulse toward conciliation. One of the sharpest
exchanges of the presidential campaign came when Obama accused Clinton of echoing the ""bluster"" of George W. Bush
after she said the U.S. would be able to ""obliterate"" Iran if it used nuclear weapons against Israel. Clinton's edgier tone
has been evident from the start of the Administration: she took a sharper position than the President on an Israeli
settlement freeze by claiming, in May, that Obama wanted ""to see a stop to settlements. Not some settlements, not
outposts, not natural-growth exceptions."" And then, in Jerusalem, her use of the word unprecedented seemed a
rhetorical leap beyond the No Drama ground rules.(Read ""Clinton's Collateral Damage."")
The White House was not entirely thrilled with either statement. But then the White House staff is several steps
removed from a negotiating process. The Palestinians are weak and divided. The Israelis have been difficult, as always:
whenever Mitchell raises East Jerusalem in talks with the Israeli Foreign Minister, the Israeli stands up and walks out of
the room. Despite Netanyahu's momentary, tactical enthusiasm for peace talks, his Likud Party has always favored the
de facto incorporation of Palestinian lands into the state of Israel.
Hillary's Choice
The tensions between the White House and State raise a fascinating question going forward. Obama and Clinton are in
substantive agreement on the President's diplomacy-first philosophy and on most policy issues — although neither is
willing to disclose the content of their private conversations — but style often predicts substance in foreign policy;
neither Obama's gauziness nor Clinton's inconsistent bluntness overseas seems particularly solid. There is a growing
perception that the Administration's policies have been thwarted across the board: Afghanistan is a mess, Iran seems
ready to scuttle the nuclear negotiations, there's no progress in the Middle East, the Syrians and North Koreans remain
recalcitrant, the Russians have been offered a freebie on missile defense, and the Chinese have been given a pass on
human rights with no apparent quid pro quos.
The White House argues that some progress has been made: Iran is on the defensive, and North Korea has said it will
return to the six-party talks. Clinton argues, correctly, about the need for ""strategic patience."" But the only thing Obama
really has to show for his efforts so far is a Nobel Prize for Potential and — no small thing — the wisdom to have
refrained from doing anything so wildly stupid as invading Iraq. The President has been willing to use military force -
the Predator drones that have decimated al-Qaeda's leadership testify to his lack of squeamishness — but this
Administration is supposed to be about the efficacy of using subtler expressions of.U.S. power. That doesn't happen
overnight, but for Obama's policies to be considered a success, it has to happen sooner or later, in a way that can be
explained to the public.
There is also a growing sense that the President's inexperience is beginning to show — not in his overall policy, which
represents the views of a broad, moderate national-security consensus ranging from Brent Scowcroft to John Kerry, but
in his execution of the details. The Afghan strategy review has been too public and taken too long; the Middle East peace
hunt has become a wild goose chase. A letter to Iran's Supreme Leader is a productive gesture only if it gets a response;
if it doesn't, it seems weak and supplicatory. A call for the Israelis to freeze settlements is effective only if it is
accompanied by the credible threat of a reduction in aid. ""You can't be seen pushing countries around — demanding
[that] Israel freeze settlements, demanding that Hamid Karzai reform his government — and not get results,"" says Leslie
H. Gelb, author of Power Rules. ""The leaders of these countries are tough, successful politicians, and they'll begin to take
you less seriously."" (See photos from the 1979 revolution in Iran.)
Clinton is unwilling to acknowledge these problems, and her staff is loath to admit her occasional mistakes. Her praise
for the President is fulsome, and aides say the relationship with Obama really — really — is strong. But there are also
burblings and emanations from Clinton's staff and friends, Foggy Bottom body language, that suggest there is a need for
the Administration to produce a second act after the Rodney King phase. And the White House is perplexed by the
uncharacteristic lack of discipline indicated by Clinton's occasional overseas gaffes.
These tensions are well within the boundaries of normal, creative policymaking. There is absolutely no indication that
the Secretary is frustrated to the point of jumping ship — or returning to politics as a candidate for governor of New
York, as has been rumored. Quite the contrary, she seems intent on making history as Secretary of State. To do that,
though, she will have to have the same authority at home as she has abroad. She will have to become the President's
primary foreign policy voice. Over the first nine months of the Obama Administration, seven different Obama officials
have spoken on the Sunday talk shows about foreign policy. Clinton has been on each of the Sunday shows once. ""Either
you have one person sending the foreign policy message, with the clear approval of the President,"" says a former
Republican Secretary of State, ""or there is no message.""(See photos from eight months of Obama's diplomacy.)
Aides to Obama say they would like to see her on the Sunday shows more often. (Indeed, Clinton's staff acknowledged
that she was asked to appear two additional times but was traveling and unable to do so.) Ultimately, though, television
is a metaphor for the larger questions that need to be resolved: How much can these former rivals — both extremely
guarded and private people — really trust each other; and, if not Clinton, who will emerge as the President's alter ego
on foreign policy? At this point, the strongest member of Obama's national-security team is Gates — but he's a
Republican and an unlikely spokesman or presidential confidant on anything beyond Pentagon issues. General Jim Jones
has settled in as National Security Adviser, but he's not a political animal — and every President needs a close foreign
policy adviser who understands the intersection of long-term strategy, politics and diplomatic chess.
Clinton's value to the Administration was clear in Pakistan. She wowed a public so skeptical that it had been questioning
the $7.5 billion in purely economic and humanitarian aid the Administration had promised. ""How much damage control
have you been able to do on this trip?"" asked Meher Bokhari, a television-news-show host, at the end of Clinton's
meeting with Pakistani women. The Secretary seemed nonplussed by the bluntness of the question. ""I don't know,"" she
said. ""I hope some.""
Afterward, I asked Bokhari to answer her own question. ""Well, this trip was long overdue,"" she said. ""The Pakistani
people really needed to talk to an American about our concerns — the strings attached to aid programs, the drone
attacks, their history of support for the military dictatorship. And it needs to be followed up. But if you ask me about the
damage control"" — she paused, thinking it through — ""I'd have to say a lot. She accomplished a lot.""
In the end, though, Clinton's success will be determined by whether she can expand her role beyond public diplomat.
She will have to become a more sure-handed negotiator and, most important, a trusted adviser to a President who
knows where he wants to go in the world but hasn't quite figured out how to get there.","['Jerusalem', 'U.S.', 'West', 'Bank', 'East', 'Jerusalem', 'Israel', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'Middle', 'East', 'Middle', 'East', 'Middle', 'East', 'Jerusalem', 'Ramallah', 'Jerusalem', 'Oslo', 'Oval', 'Office', 'Iraq', 'Jerusalem', 'Middle', 'East', 'Haggling', '101', 'Afghanistan', 'Pakistan', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'Jerusalem', 'Pakistan', 'Middle', 'East', 'Pakistan', 'U.S.', 'Pakistan', 'U.S.', 'Pakistan', 'Islamabad', 'U.S.', 'Pakistan', 'Pakistan', 'Pakistan', 'South', 'Asia', 'India', 'Jerusalem', 'Beijing', 'First', 'Lady', 'Beijing', 'Arkansas', 'London', 'Washington', 'Pentagon', 'Haiti', 'U.S.', 'Iran', 'Israel', 'Jerusalem', 'White', 'House', 'East', 'Jerusalem', 'Israel', 'Afghanistan', 'Iran', 'Middle', 'East', 'Iran', 'North', 'Korea', 'Iraq', 'Middle', 'East', 'Iran', 'Israel', 'Iran', 'New', 'York', 'Pakistan']"

ARNAUD DE BORCHGRAVE
UPI Editor at Large
WASHINGTON, Nov. 4 (UPI) -- If we are successful beyond President Obama's wildest dreams -- e.g., the
Taliban is wiped out and a tough new Afghan government does not allow al-Qaida or other terrorists to conspire
against us on their territory -- would that make us safer from radical Islam? The answer, of course, is no,
because this is riot about geography. Two veteran intelligence operatives with much Middle Eastern and Afghan
experience, speaking not for attribution, agreed a stable, secure Afghanistan doesn't change the equation, at least
not significantly.
The popular perception of al-Qaida in Afghanistan is the same propaganda news clip, shown a gazillion times
over the last eight years, replete with terrorist ""trainees"" in shalwar-kameez (knee-length shirts over baggy
pantaloons) running through obstacle courses and emerging from tunnels, presumably to kill us all in our beds.
Al-Qaida doesn't need commando-steeled volunteers to attack the United States and its allies. For the next Sept.
11, the chances are they have already selected highly motivated, brainwashed wackjobs among the graduates of
Pakistan's madrassas, who look forward to a one button push to the land of plenty in the sky where 72 impatient
maidens await their arrival. Al-Qaida's ""martyrs"" don't need Afghan training camps for WMD terrorism. In fact,
to be inconspicuous, they should not have the physique of an avoid-at-all-cost likely to arouse suspicion.
Al-Qaida does not need Afghanistan for its next terrorist objective. In fact, those who follow events in
Afghanistan closely were taken aback when Obama said Afghanistan was a war of necessity because that's
where al-Qaida. is. They haven't been there since Afghanistan was liberated in October 2001. They moved to
Pakistan's tribal areas where they attracted volunteers from the Middle East and Europe. When a reconstituted
Taliban insurgent force re-entered Afghanistan in large numbers in 2004, al-Qaida was not interested in its now
insecure old training camps. Even if Pakistan's current offensive.against the Taliban and al-Qaida in the tribal
areas is successful, al-Qaida is not an entity that can be captured or destroyed. Its clandestine operatives are
widely scattered in the Middle East, Africa, Europe, North and South America.
As alternatives to Afghanistan and Pakistan, Yemen, in the vernacular of the intelligence community, will do/is
doing it. Somalia will do/is doing it. West African states whose writ doesn't extend much beyond their capitals
will do/are doing it. Grimy North African suburbs of major French cities will do/are doing it. British provincial
towns with Pakistani enclaves will do/are doing it. And the Internet's thousands of pro-al-Qaida Web sites will
do/are doing it.
Osama bin Laden and his deputy Ayman al-Zawahiri are believed to be comfortably installed in a tribal chiefs
compound somewhere near Quetta, the capital of Pakistan's constantly rebellious Baluchistan province, which
has 48 percent of the country's land with. only 10 million of its 175 million people. There is no al-Qaida central
issuing orders to thousands of adherents the world over.
If the:re is no connection between Afghanistan and the core problem of ""no more Sept. lls,"" what are the United
States and 41 friendly nations doing there? Even in the event of a Taliban victory in the years to come, the
Taliban would not be stupid enough to invite al-Qaida back. Three months prior to Sept. 11, 2001, there was
palpable tension between Taliban leader Mullah Omar and bin Laden. Omar complained that bin Laden was
issuing ""too many fatwas (religious edicts) which he has no business doing as he didn't complete his religious
education."" Omar also prevented journalists from seeing bin Laden. The Taliban leader knows he lost power
and his country because of what bin Laden and his terrorists did to the United States.
In today's Afghanistan almost everything turns out to be corruption and mismanagement. The average citizen
has seen little benefit from expenditures in the $250 billion range -- on top of $1 trillion in Iraq. The .U.S. effort
has been plagued by fraud, laced with mismanagement and bereft of strategic focus. One example among many
others came in 2007 when the United States awarded a massive contract worth some $300 million to A:EY, a
Florida-based company, to supply the Afghan army with 52 types of ammo, chiefly bullets for AK-47s. All
requirements for safety inspections, mandatory for all ammo delivered to U.S. forces, were removed. Thus AEY
was able to shop around in Eastern Europe for the cheapest ammo available. Millions of rounds of old Chinese
ammo made in the 1960s turned out to be substandard. and dangerous.
The State Department was aware of what was going on but did not object as speed was the only criterion. AEY
and its officers were eventually indicted in Florida. But U.S. officials involved got off with a slap on the wrist.
Wherever U.S. inspectors look, they find fraud and abuse. There are even cases -- reported by GlobalPost
reporter Jean Mackenzie -- of American contractors paying bribes to the Taliban to ensure aid projects are not
disrupted. This is a recipe for a war without end. She also reports a disguised Taliban office in Kabul that
reviews all aid projects and determines the amount to be paid to the Taliban.
If true, the United States is paying the Afghan government to fight the Taliban while also paying the Taliban to
fight the Afghan government.
The key lies in Pakistan. Almost all terrorist trails in Europe lead back to Pakistan -- and its madrassas. These
are the free Koranic schools that have stepped into the vacuum of no education system for the poor as the
military takes up 50 percent of government revenue. A fraction of what the United States has spent in Iraq and
Afghanistan would go a long way to turning Pakistan around. Instead, Congress, in its infinite wisdom, after
authorizing $1.2 trillion in both wars allocated $7.5 billion to Pakistan over five years -- with umpteen caveats.
In a country of 175 million, a drop in the proverbial bucket.","['WASHINGTON', 'Afghanistan', 'Afghanistan', 'United', 'States', 'Pakistan', 'Al-Qaida', 'Afghanistan', 'Afghanistan', 'Afghanistan', 'Afghanistan', 'Pakistan', 'Middle', 'East', 'Europe', 'Afghanistan', 'Pakistan', 'Middle', 'East', 'Africa', 'Europe', 'North', 'South', 'America', 'Afghanistan', 'Pakistan', 'Yemen', 'Somalia', 'Quetta', 'Pakistan', 'Baluchistan', 'province', 'Afghanistan', 'United', 'States', 'United', 'States', 'Afghanistan', 'Iraq', 'United', 'States', 'U.S.', 'Eastern', 'Europe', 'Florida', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'Kabul', 'United', 'States', 'Pakistan', 'Europe', 'Pakistan', 'United', 'States', 'Iraq', 'Afghanistan', 'Pakistan', 'Pakistan']"

Report: Obama's national security team
'incredibly weak'
Wed, 11/04/2009 - 1:45pm
Despite an expansion of the National Security Council staff, coordination of national security policy is still dysfunctional
and there is a lack of strategic guidance from President Obama, according to a group of leading outside experts and
former officials.
""Reform must take place,"" said dames Lalher, President & CEO of the r!-olect on n; alone! Security Reform (PNSR), If
you did not like what happened in the last 7 or 8 years... you're not going to like what's coming in the future.""
""Momentum for reform is building, but it is largely rhetoric and good intentions,"" reads PNSR's .new report . The
congressionally funded group was begun as the result of a cooperative agreement between the Defense Department and
the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. ""Strategic management of the national security system remains absent
and is desperately needed to make it integrated, cohesive, and agile,"" the report continues.
Calling reform of the national security infrastructure ""the number one national security issue,"" Locher said that America's
ability to operate in international arenas the world over is ""crippled"" by the dysfunction within the system.
He called the White House's national security staff ""incredibly weak,"" preventing integration and coordination
that the National Security Council should be doing.
""There's almost no strategic guidance from the president or the executive office of the president,"" Locher said,
adding, ""We have almost no knowledge management in the national security system.""
There's also no effective means for delegating the president's authority, he added.
Locher spoke a an event rolling out the latest PNSR report at the New American Foundation; hosted by its foreign policy
chief and editor of V/gst1inc.Vgz? N.DtL:9 Steve Clemons.
Clemons noted that according to the Goldwater-Nichols act, President Obama was required to submit a national security
strategy by June 18, 150 days into his presidency, but he failed to do so.
The ""Guiding Coalition"" that oversaw the PNSR report included heavyweights such as former Lockheed Martin CEO
Norman Augustine, former Amb. Robert Blackwill, retired Gen. Wesley Clark, retired Adm. Ed Giambastiani, former
House Speaker Newt Gingrich, former Director of National Intelligence Mike McConnell, plus Washington players Brent
Scowcroft, Thomas Pickering, and Joseph Nye.
Last November's version of the PNSR report included input from now Obama officials Jim Jones, James Steinberg,
Michele Flournoy, and Dennis Blair. It declared that ""the national security of the United States of America is
fundamentally at risk.""","['Washington', 'United', 'States', 'of', 'America']"

3183,"#sWASHINGTON (CNN) — Fewer than three in 10 Americans think Sarah Palin's qualified to be president, according to a
new national poll - the least of any of the five potential candidates included in the survey.
But another woman tops that list in the CNN/Opinion Research Corporation survey released Monday: two-thirds of the
public thinks that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's qualified for the Oval Office. That's more than Vice President Joe
Biden, who's currently next in line for the presidency.
According to the poll, 28 percent of Americans say Palin is qualified to run the White House, with seven in 10 saying the
former Alaska governor and 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee is not qualified.
The survey indicates that a majority of Republicans, 54 percent, feel Palin is qualified, with 44 percent indicating she
isn't. But only 29 percent of independent voters questioned feel she is qualified to serve as president, with 68 percent
disagreeing. According to the poll, nine in 10 Democrats feel Palin is not qualified.
The poll's release comes one day before the release of Palin's book, ""Going Rogue: An American Life.""
""The perception that Palin is not qualified to be president puts her significantly behind two potential rivals for the GOP
nomination in 2012 - Mitt Romney and Mike Huckabee,"" says CNN Polling Director Keating Holland.
According to the survey, nearly half of all Americans think Romney is qualified to be president, with 43 percent feeling
the same way about Huckabee. Among Republicans, Palin is still lagging other potential 2012 primary candidates: 63
percent of GOPers think that Romney and Huckabee are qualified, 9 points higher than the number that say the same of
Palin.""
Palin has many strengths - recent CNN polls indicate that Americans believe that she is not a typical politician, that she
cares about average Americans, and that she is honest and trustworthy,"" says Holland. ""But the perception that she is
not qualified for the White House is her biggest Achilles heel.""An ABC News/Washington Post poll also released Monday
indicates that 38 percent of Americans say Palin's qualified to serve as president, with six in 10 saying she's not qualified.
The CNN survey indicates that 67 percent of people questioned say that Clinton is qualified to serve in the Oval Office,
17 points higher than the 50 percent of Americans who think that Biden's qualified to take over as president.Biden's low
number may be attributable to negative feelings about the Obama/Biden administration rather than views of Biden
personally.""
In the past, poll respondents who dislike an administration have sometimes taken it out on the vice president,"" say
Holland. Polls from the late 1990s showed that Americans felt Al Gore was qualified to be president, but only if
respondents were given the chance to say something negative about Gore that was unrelated to his qualifications, he
adds. In the Bush administration, the number who thought Dick Cheney was qualified to be president dropped as the
administration grew more unpopular. ""Cheney's experience in office didn't change during that period - attitudes toward
the Bush/Cheney administration did,"" he says.
Hillary Clinton also has the advantage of having been able to stay out of domestic policy debates, including health care,
the economic stimulus, and other controversial matters, while adding almost daily to her experience in foreign policy,
Holland adds, while Biden has been involved in the domestic policy disputes - ""which might explain why some
respondents were looking for a reason to say something negative about the veep.""
The CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll was conducted November 13-15, with 1,014 adult Americans questioned by
telephone. The survey's sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points for the overall sample.","['Oval', 'Office', 'Alaska', 'Oval', 'Office', 'Holland', 'Holland']"

would be a wonderful signal to the women that we do value the role that they are and must continue to play to move
Afghanistan forward.
Secondly, it would also be helpful because there is growing concern at home that the women are going to be abandoned.
I have to meet with Sen. Casey tom'w, for example. He believes that the women are critical to stability and peace in
Afghanistan and wants to discuss our commitment.
Lastly, as Pres, Karzai is beginning to plan his cabinet, perhaps you could mention to him the need to bring in some of the
talented and experienced women into his government. At our Shura meeting yesterday, we discussed upcoming
ministerial positions. We, of course, have no guarantee that Karzai will listen, but his government would be a lot better if
he tapped women and so many are highly qualified.

Samuel J. Heyman, who stood out as a corporate raider who preferred to hold on to companies he bought and run them
rather that sell them for a quick profit, died Sunday at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. He was 70.
Mr. Heyman's death was confirmed by his wife, Ronnie, who said he had died after complications from open heart
surgery.
Mr. Heyman was most recently chairman of the GAF Corporation, a manufacturer of roofing materials, and a chemical
company that was spun off from GAF, called International Specialty Products. Both companies are based in Wayne, N.J.
A group led by Mr. Heyman bought GAF in 1983 and took it private in 1987 after the stock market crashed. He later spun
off GAF's chemical business into a separate company, I.S.P.
During that period, corporate raiders tended to buy companies, cut operational costs and then sell them at a profit. But
after Mr. Heyman won a battle with GAF's management for control of the company, he told The New York Times: ""There
is a very strong potential in chemicals, and we plan to make them grow.""
Mr. Heyman, who was also a lawyer, had diverse business holdings, including Heyman Properties, which owns shopping
malls in the Northeast and which grew out of a business he had inherited from his father.
""He was extremely methodical. There was a rhyme and reason to everything he did,"" said Leon Black, the chairman of
Apollo Management, a private equity firm, and a longtime friend who was once Mr. Heyman's investment banker.
Mr. Black added: ""He combined a strong legal background with a strong analytical business strength, and he was a fierce
negotiator. But what really made Sam kick was that he was a builder. It was all about building, whether it was his
companies, his real estate, his art collection or his family.""
Mr. Heyman was born March 1, 1939, in Danbury, Conn., to Annette and Lazarus Heyman. His father was a real estate
developer. After graduating from Yale in 1960 and Harvard Law School in 1964, Mr. Heyman went to work in the Justice
Department under Robert F. Kennedy and served as chief assistant United States attorney for Connecticut. He had to cut
that career short when his father needed him to take over the real estate development business.
Mr. Heyman made his biggest mark in the 1983 battle for GAF. A group of shareholders led by Mr. Heyman became
frustrated by management's resistance to selling some of its biggest assets, including the chemicals business.
Mr. Heyman waged an aggressive campaign against the company's chairman and ultimately forced his removal through
a shareholder vote - a rare victory for shareholders during a time when executives of public companies were considered
virtually untouchable.
Once Mr. Heyman took control of GAF, he reversed course and held on to the chemicals business, ultimately making it a
big contributor to the company's profit.
He also moved quickly to cut costs and revamp the business, saying at the time that he was an ""impatient man. When I
see a place where money can be saved, I don't waste time.""
Mr. Heyman also gave away money. In 1999, he founded the Partnership for Public Service, which provides fellowships
to encourage students to pursue careers in public service. For his charity work, Mr. Heyman won the President's Citizens
Award in 2008.
His other philanthropic interests included the establishment of the Samuel and Ronnie Heyman Center on Corporate
Governance at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law.
He and his wife also collected art. Among their holdings are works by Mark Rothko and Jackson Pollock.
In addition to his wife, the former Ronnie Feuerstein, Mr. Heyman is survived by his mother, Annette Heyman of Palm
Beach, Fla.; four children, Lazarus Heyman, Eleanor Propp, Jennifer Millstone and Elizabeth Winter; and nine
grandchildren.","['Mount', 'Sinai', 'Hospital', 'Manhattan', 'Wayne', 'N.J.', 'Northeast', 'Danbury', 'Conn.', 'United', 'States', 'Connecticut', 'Palm', 'Beach', 'Fla.']"

Obama administration picks former Gates Foundation official to run US foreign aid
By MATTHEW LEE
Associated Press
ij 11-10-2009 13:46
11 SINGAPORE (AP) _ The Obama administration will nominate a young former executive with the Bill and
Melinda Gates Foundation to run America's top foreign assistance program, ending months of speculation
and complaints about who would take the vacant post, U.S. officials said Tuesday.
$ President Barack Obama has chosen Rajiv Shah, a medical doctor and currently a senior official at the
Department of Agriculture dealing with food security, to run the U.S. Agency for International
Development, the officials said.
¶ The officials spoke on condition of anonymity pending notification to Congress and a formal public
announcement of the choice.
11 Shah's selection, which must still be confirmed by the Senate, would end a 10-month leadership
vacuum at USAID, which has been operating with an acting director since Obama took office despite his
campaign pledges to have the agency play a greater role in foreign policy.
11 Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton have said USAID is crucial to deploying their
preferred ""smart power"" foreign policy strategy, which envisions more equal roles for diplomacy and
development alongside defense. They plan to double the amount of foreign aid.
11 The agency will play a key role in the administration's efforts in Afghanistan and Pakistan, where
officials believe the civilian component must be strengthened.
$ But the top job at the agency has remained vacant until now, with several prime candidates'
withdrawing from consideration amid a White House vetting process that Clinton denounced in July as
""ridiculous,"" ""a nightmare,"" and ""frustrating beyond words.""
$ Shah, 36, whose family immigrated to the U.S. from India, is now the Under Secretary for Research,
Education and Economics and Chief Scientist at the Agriculture Department where he manages a budget
of more than $2.6 billion and more than 10,000 staff around the world.
¶ Before that, he had several positions at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, including managing its
$1.5 billion contribution to a global vaccination fund and helping launch the foundation's Global
Development program where he oversaw a $1.3 billion investment portfolio.
The lingering USAID vacancy, particularly after several leading candidates pulled out, had upset
development experts and Congress. Some lawmakers had suggested that Obama choose someone who
had already gone through the vetting process.
¶ Shah fits that bill and has important political credentials, having worked with or for several leading
Democratic politicians.

FYI: Murdoch makes his move to Cameron. Attack on BBC to follow. Sid
Has Cameron done a deal with Murdoch?
By Andy McSmith
Lord Mandelson's attack shines spotlight on Tory leader's
links with media mogul
David Cameron has been accused of making a ""contract"" with Britain's biggest media company to trade political support
before an election for government favours afterwards if the Tories win.
The accusation was levelled yesterday by the Business Secretary Peter Mandelson, who is increasingly the public face of
Gordon Brown's government. Ministers are angry at the campaign that The Sun has run against the Prime Minister all this
week over the spelling mistakes in a letter Mr Brown sent to the mother of a young soldier killed in Afghanistan.
They suspect that the Conservative Party has been tailoring its policies on media regulation and the BBC to suit the
commercial interests of News International, which owns The Sun, and that the paper's aggressive support for the Tories is
a pay-off that could spread to other parts of the mass media.
Examples of the apparent tie-in between what News International's boss, James Murdoch, wants, and what David
Cameron is ready to promise include the recent decision by the Conservatives to abandon the idea of ""top slicing"" the
BBC licence fee. It had been proposed that part of the money paid to the BBC would be siphoned off to help regional
television companies meet the threat from the internet. But this would also have helped them compete more effectively
against Sky News, which is part of the Murdoch media empire.
When the policy was abandoned in September, Jeremy Hunt, the shadow Culture Secretary, said that it was because
enacting it might make the commercial television companies ""focus not on attracting viewers but on attracting subsidies"".
There was no gain for the BBC in the climbdown, because David Cameron had already said that the Tories will freeze the
licence fee. What it will mean is that the BBC's income will be capped, without the regional television companies seeing
any government help, which will strengthen the market position of Britain's only satellite television company, Sky. ""This
was done for News International,"" a Tory insider said yesterday. ""Murdoch wants Sky to go head to head with the BBC.
He doesn't want the independent companies strengthened.""
In April 2008, James Murdoch complained bitterly about the media regulator Ofcom in his first major speech after taking
over as chief executive of News Corporation in Europe and Asia. The following year, David Cameron announced that a
Conservative government would cut Ofcom down to size.
Last summer James Murdoch attacked the ""abysmal record"" of the BBC Trust - the body created by Labour to over see
the BBC - in a lecture he gave at the Edinburgh Festival, singling out its ""total failure"" to stop the BBC buying the Lonely
Planet travel guides, a takeover that Murdoch denounced as an ""egregious"" invasion of private enterprise by the state.
Less than two months later, Jeremy Hunt promised that the Tories would abolish the Trust.
In the same lecture, Murdoch complained that BBC performers like Jonathan Ross are being paid salaries that ""no
commercial competitor can afford"". He had barely uttered the words before Ed Vaizey, a shadow media minister,
promised that a Tory government would compel the BBC to publish the salaries of its top performers.
Lord Mandelson alleged yesterday that the Conservatives and News International had ""effectively formed a contract, over
the head, incidentally, of the newspaper's editor and their readers, in which they are sort of bound to one another"".
Speaking to the BBC's Today programme, he added: ""What The Sun can do for the Conservatives during the election is
one part of the contract and, presumably, what the Conservatives can do for News International if they are elected is the
other side of the bargain. But there is a wider question. When The Sun creates the news in this way, this is then followed
up by Sky News, which then puts pressure on the BBC to follow suit.""
This was ""absolutely, categorically"" denied yesterday by The Sun's political editor, Tom Newton Dunn, who accused Lord
Mandelson of talking ""preposterous nonsense"".
The Sun, which supported Labour through three general elections under Tony Blair's leadership, announced that it was
jumping ship on the day that Gordon Brown delivered his annual speech to the Labour Party conference in September.
Its onslaught on Gordon Brown for the mistakes made in a handwritten letter to Jacqui Janes is the most aggressive
attack that the newspaper has directed at any Labour Party leader since Neil Kinnock stood down after losing the 1992
general election, a defeat for which The Sun claimed victory with the slogan ""It was The Sun wot won it"".
But there were signs yesterday that the attack may have rebounded on The Sun. Mr Brown, who is blind in one eye, has
admitted that his handwriting is bad and has apologised to Mrs Janes, whose 20-year-old son, Jamie, was killed by a
makeshift bomb in Afghanistan last month.
A poll yesterday for the website PoliticsHome, whose main shareholder is the Conservative Party deputy chairman Lord
Ashcroft, found that 65 per cent of those polled thought that The Sun's attack was ""inappropriate"" compared with 23 per
cent who thought it was ""legitimate"".
The closeness of the new Tory-Sun axis is shown up by the revelation, from an inside source, that David Cameron
personally consulted the editor of The Sun, Dominic Mohan, in three separate conversations before he abandoned his
""cast-iron"" promise to hold a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty, now that all 27 members states of the EU have ratified it.
Mr Cameron was understandably wary of how The Sun might react to the abandonment of that promise. The paper has
campaigned for years against what it sees as the growth of an EU superstate. It was in an open letter to readers of The
Sun that Cameron first made his guarantee, two years ago.
His announcement that a referendum is off the agenda was subjected to a scathing attack in'the Daily Mail, but in The
Sun it was given kid-glove treatment under the headline ""Cameron's crusade for UK rights"".
The person behind this aggressively pro-Tory policy is James Murdoch, not his father, Rupert, who created The Sun
virtually from scratch in the 1970s. Rupert Murdoch claimed in an interview with Sky News Australia that he ""regretted"" his
son's decision to turn against Gordon Brown, ""who is a friend of mine"", but defended it on the grounds that Brown has
been a ""disappointment"".
Yesterday, The Times, another Murdoch newspaper, announced that its veteran political editor, Phil Webster, is leaving
the Commons, where he has been based for decades. Mr Webster is very well thought of by New Labour. His
replacement, Roland Watson, was a friend of David Cameron's at Eton but has no political ties with the Tories.
Tom Newton Dunn, newly appointed as The Sun's political editor, is another Old Etonian. His father, Bill, used to be a
Tory MEP, but defected to the Liberal Democrats in 2000.

For the first time, Republican Rob Portman is inching ahead of the two Democrats in the 2010 race for Ohio's
U.S. Senate seat, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released today. Also for the first time, Ohio voters
disapprove 50 - 45 percent of the job President Barack Obama is doing, down from his 53 - 42 percent approval
September 16 and 49 - 44 percent approval July 7.
In still another first, voters are split 40 - 40 percent on who is doing a better job handling health care, the
President or Congressional Republicans, the independent Quinnipiac (KWIN-uh- pe-ack) University survey
finds. In a September 16 survey on the same question, Obama was on top 49 - 28 percent.
Ohio voters disapprove 53 - 42 percent of the way the President is handling the economy and disapprove 57 -
36 percent of the way he is handling health care. In September, they approved of his handling of the economy
48 - 46 percent and split on his handling of health care 44 - 45 percent.

worrisome number at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. since the GOP is still pretty much a four-letter word in most of
America.""
Independent voters, often the group that decides Ohio elections, disapprove 49 - 45 percent of the overall job
Obama is doing and disapprove 54 - 39 percent of his handling of the economy. They disapprove 62 - 34
percent, almost 2-1, of his handling of health care.
""In July, when the President's job approval began falling nationally from the high 50s and low 60s into the low
50s, Ohio was the first place it showed up in the polls,"" said Brown.
Portman, a former Congressman running for the U.S. Senate in 2010, has small leads over two Democrats,
topping Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner 38 - 34 percent and Lt. Gov. Lee Fisher 39 - 36 percent. In the
battle for the Democratic Senate nomination, Fisher gets 24 percent to Brunner's 22 percent, with 51 percent
undecided. Portman leads car dealer Tom Ganley 26 - 7 percent in a GOP primary with 64 percent undecided.
""None of the Senate candidates are very well known, but what is significant is that until now Democrats were
winning all the Senate matchups. Clearly there is an at least temporary swing toward the GOP in Ohio. Whether
it continues is anyone's guess,"" said Brown.
Ohio voters oppose Obama's health care plan 55 - 36 percent, with independents against it 57 - 33 percent. By a
61 - 35 percent margin, voters don't think Congress should approve a health care overhaul if it only gets
Democratic votes.
But Ohio voters support 53 - 40 percent giving people the option of a government health insurance plan.
Independent voters support this public option 55 - 38 percent.
Afghanistan
The United States is doing the right thing fighting in Afghanistan, Ohio voters say 48 - 43 percent. Voters
support 51 - 40 percent the recommendations of the top U.S. commanders in Afghanistan that 40,000 more U.S.
troops should be sent.
""But 55 percent of Ohioans say they are only willing to see large numbers of American troops in Afghanistan
for two years or less, which is hardly a mandate for the type of long-term commitment that the Pentagon has
said will be needed for victory,"" said Brown.
From November 5 - 9, Quinnipiac University surveyed 1,123 Ohio voters, with a margin of error of +/- 2.9
percentage points. The survey includes 406 Republicans and 394 Democrats, each with a margin of error of +/-
4.9 percentage points.

Can the Clinton Coalition Survive Obama?
By Sean Trende
John Judis and Ruy Teixeira's well-regarded 2002 work The Emerging Democratic Majority begins with a vignette set in
Virginia. They tell the story of a telecom executive named Mark Warner, who runs a moderate campaign that appeals to
upper-middle class suburbanites and working class rural voters, and manages to put together a winning coalition that, if
imitated in other states, might put the Democrats in power for decades to come.
Democrats did build coalitions similar to Warner's, and in fact had been doing so for the better part of a decade. Warner's
coalition was essentially Bill Clinton's 1996 coalition. The coalition and brand that Clinton built was an extraordinarily
successful one for Democrats, breaking the momentum of a resurgent GOP in 1996, and ultimately enabling the election
of the most liberal President in American History last year.
Given this background, it's only appropriate that the first tangible sign that this coalition is coming unglued has come in
Virginia. Republican Bob McDonnell won the governorship with almost 59% of the vote — the highest percentage (though
not the highest victory margin) for any governor since 1961. The entire Republican ticket won by similar margins, and the
GOP picked up six seats in the General Assembly. It could have been even worse — five Democrats won their Assembly
races by fewer than 1,000 votes.
There are some superficial lessons to be drawn here. After last week's election, it's silly to argue that the GOP brand is
too damaged for them to take advantage of Democratic weakness. And the Democrats' latest spin — that their weakness
among Independents was simply a function of more Republicans calling themselves independents but retaining their
Republican voting habits — puts the lie to the argument that Republicans' low self-identification is a salient factor in
elections.
But the most important lesson is this: while there's little predictive value in off-year elections, they do provide snapshots of
the mood of the electorate, and the present state of political coalitions. Given Virginia's primacy in the story of Democratic
coalition building, it gives us a good snapshot of the state of that coalition. And it's not a pretty one for Democrats.
The historical base of the Democratic Party for two centuries has long been what Jay Cost and I call Jacksonians:
Culturally conservative, hawkish, and populist whites located throughout the South and Border states. They began
breaking away from Democrats in the 1950s and 1960s — their reaction to the Party's embrace of unions, blacks and
liberals is a story is so well known there's no need to rehash it here.
But this group remained at least in play for the Democrats. Clinton inherited a coalition consisting of minorities, liberals,
urban voters, and a decent remnant of Jacksonian voters in the Ohio River Valley and the South, who still preferred a
moderate-to-conservative Democrat to a Republican. This coalition became a majority coalition when Clinton used a
combination of fiscal conservatism and social moderation to bring suburban voters on board. This was a huge innovation
for Democrats; suburbs like Nassau County, NY, Orange County, CA and Fairfax County, VA had fueled the rise of the
Republican parties in those states. Clinton moved them substantially toward his side. This coalition allowed him to win by
eight points in 1996; absent Perot and a last-minute fundraising scandal, he probably would have won by more.
Clinton intuited that suburban voters are, generally speaking, culturally cosmopolitan — they don't like it when you call
someone ""macaca,"" and aren't crazy about the religious right. But they're generally not particularly socially liberal either,
and are fans of ""law and order."" They like taxes low and appreciate economic growth, but like good schools and a clean
environment. Having to balance a bunch of spending priorities with somewhat limited income in their daily lives, balanced
budgets are the ultimate ""good government"" indicator for these voters.
Clinton delivered on all of these issues, keeping tax increases fairly small, and balancing the budget for much of his term.
In so doing — and this is very important — he re-branded the Democrats as the party of fiscal responsibility, economic
growth, moderate taxes, and smart government. In other words, he finally shed the ""Carter"" label for the Democrats. This,
in turn, made it plausible for his much more liberal heirs to benefit from this presumption of competence for Democrats -
one that they probably would not have enjoyed without him.
George W. Bush's presidency, in turn, was an upper-middle class suburbanite's nightmare. An aggressive social agenda,
a fiscal trainwreck, two poorly-managed wars and a financial collapse later, these suburban voters trended even more
heavily Democratic then they were in the Clinton era. By 2008, Democrats held most of the suburban districts around ,
major metropolitan areas, and were threatening in the exurbs. The right Democratic candidate probably could have put
together a massive 2008 Presidential majority, combining minorities, liberals, Jacksonians, Catholics, and suburbanites.
The mood of the country was certainly right for a 1920/1932/1952/1980 result.
But the Democrats nominated Barack Obama. The party's grip among Jacksonians had weakened since Clinton left the
stage, but they abandoned Obama completely. Jay Cost and I have detailed this here. This movement is why Obama
received 53% of the vote, instead of the 60% or so we might expect given the voters' attitude toward Bush's Presidency.
Obama was able to win even without this branch of the Democratic party because he generated such intensity among the
remaining portions of his base. In other words, while his base wasn't as broad as Clinton's, it was deeper. Faced with
vanishing 401ks and home values, and disgust with Bush's presidency, suburbanites flocked to him. Liberals were
enthralled to finally elect one of their own. And minorities turned out heavily for the opportunity to elect the first black
President.
But this presents a problem. You only get to elect the first black President once, and governing a coalition of suburbanites,
poor blacks, and upper class liberals isn't easy. It is hard to keep that enthusiasm up. And with the Jacksonian wing of the
party gone, if that enthusiasm dissipates, or if one of the coalition groups becomes disgruntled and starts to shuffle out the
door, the party isn't left with much.
We see a microcosm of this story in last Tuesday's elections, especially in Virginia. Let's backtrack to 2001, and look at
the counties that Mark Warner won.
The coalition that Warner built was similar to Clinton's. To oversimplify some, it blended together rural Democrats in the
mining counties in the west of the state, college voters around Charlottesville, and black voters combined with rural whites
in the south central and southeastern portion of the state with suburban voters in the northeast. It was a diverse coalition,
but it worked.
Now let's compare Warner's map with Obama's map in 2008:
The suburbs stayed in the Democrat's camp, for reasons discussed above. But look what happens in the west! That area
becomes solidly Republican. Buchanan and Dickenson counties in the Virginia panhandle voted for Dukakis, Mondale,
and Adlai Stevenson (twice). Obama became only the second Democrat to lose these counties since the UMW moved in
during the 1920s.
As I said, this isn't a problem so long as (1) the Jacksonians show a willingness to come back for a candidate other than
Obama and/or (2) the suburbs continue their love affair with the Democrats. But we see indications in Virginia that the
Jacksonian divorce may, in fact, be permanent. Creigh Deeds was from the western section of the state, and seemed — at
least on paper — capable of remaking the Mark Warner map. It didn't happen, obviously. Let's look at how Virginia
changed from Bush's 2000 election to Deeds' loss last week:
The redder a county is, the more it moved toward the Republicans from 2000 to 2009; bluer counties moved toward
Democrats.
We see that McDonnell did as well as Bush did in the suburbs — but no better. Those pockets of white are the DC
suburbs in the northeast, the Hampton Roads area in the southeast, and Richmond just to the north and west of Hampton
Roads. Its rural Virginia — which is still about 1/3 of the electorate — that made the difference between Bush's 54% in
2004 and McDonnell's 59% on Tuesday. Even with Obama off the ticket, and a much less cosmopolitan figure atop the
ticket, rural Virginia went solidly Republican.
We can take another angle here. Deeds and McDonnell squared off in a very close Attorney General race in 2005. Let's
compare Deeds' 2005 showing to his 2009 performance. [NOTE: In this map, we look at ""relative movement."" Because
everything in the state moved toward McDonnell, a map just showing ""movement"" would be solid dark red, and not of
much use. So instead, if something moved more than 9 points toward McDonnell, it is colored a shade of red, if it moved
less than 9 points toward McDonnell, it is blue. Think of this as showing the change in the counties' PVI].
We see the same result. Just since 2005, rural Virginia has moved sharply against the Democrats. The suburbs haven't
moved much at all, relative to the rest of the state, while the more heavily African American counties in the southern
portion of the state have moved a few notches leftward (in absolute terms, they voted in 2009 as they had in 2005). This
suggests lasting damage to the Democratic brand here that is not simply personal to Obama.
Now let's look at how McDonnell did when compared to McCain in 2008. Again, because the movement here was so
dramatic statewide, we need to isolate the biggest and smallest changes by looking only at ""relative"" shifts.
The western counties of the state didn't shift much from 2008, but that's because they were already giving Republicans
around 70% of the vote — there wasn't much room for Republican growth (and remember, ""blue"" in a relative map still
means slight movement toward the Republican since 2008)! The real Republican gains over the past year have come in
the DC exurbs, in the 1-95 corridor, and to a lesser extent in the Hampton Roads area.
In other words, the Jacksonians aren't returning to the Democrats, at least in Virginia. Deeds might still have been able to
win without them, but the Democrats are also showing weakness in the Virginia suburbs. In other words, two pieces of the
Clinton-Warner coalition are starting to break away.
This is a real problem for the Democrats. If the suburbanites and the Jacksonians move away from the party, there is
very, very little left for them. And there's reason to think that the suburban weakness is real. Obama's fiscal policy, to
make an understatement, hasn't been Clintonian. It may not be entirely his fault, but the $787 billion stimulus, the trillion
dollar healthcare bill, the automobile bailout, and the budget showing trillion dollar deficits extending for the next decade
make suburbanites shudder. They don't much like debt, and they intuit this spending is going to have to be paid for at
some point — probably by them. Voters still give Obama some benefit of the doubt, as they do most Presidents in their first
year, but they are becoming very, very worried, and probably don't put much stock in Candidate Obama's promise to
enact a net spending cut any more.
Democrats will doubtless chalk this up to Creigh Deeds' inept campaign. Deeds wasn't a great candidate, but when the
mood of the country is starting to swing against your party, it is hard to run a good campaign. Jerry Kilgore found this out
when he ran in a similar environment in 2005, and was reduced to attacking Tim Kaine for his religious views on the death
penalty. And if you run the Deeds-McDonnell race in 2006 or 2008, I think its hard to argue McDonnell would win by 18
points, even holding everything else equal.
The other problem with this explanation is that we saw similar results replicated around the country. Most of the seats in
the House of Delegates that the Democrats lost in Virginia, or came close to losing, were suburban. The Philly suburbs
voted Republican for the state Supreme Court. Bergen County New Jersey didn't give the Republican 60% of the vote like
it did in 1984, but Chris Christie nearly carried it, and even though he is significantly more conservative than Christie Todd
Whitman or Tom Kean, he won the largest margin for a first-term Republican Governor since 1969. Conservative
Republicans won elections in Westchester County, New York, and Republicans picked up two City Council seats on the
outskirts of Queens. Republicans won back the Nassau County legislature -- the Democrats' capture of that body figures
prominently in the introduction to Emerging Democratic Majority -- and nearly defeated the Democratic County Executive
there with an obscure, underfunded candidate. In other words, in places that have never heard of Creigh Deeds or seen
his attack ads on McDonell's thesis, the Democrats still lost suburban voters.
States with a Democratic base of liberals, urbanites, and minority voters -- like California and New York -- haven't moved
much against Democrats. Obama's polling numbers, as well as those of Democratic candidates for Governor and
Senator, in classic ""Emerging Democratic Majority"" states like Colorado and Nevada are not looking good at all. And of
course in Jacksonian states like Kentucky, he's below 40%.
This doesn't mean that Democrats are doomed in 2010. An improved economy, Republican missteps, and a host of other
factors could keep the band together for them. Maybe some of the more marginal voters that Obama brought to the polls
to enact hope and change will return in 2010 to keep hope alive. But the personal nature of Obama's victory is starting to
show its downside for downticket Democrats.
The Clinton coalition is looking creaky. If Obama doesn't improve and the coalition comes apart, Democrats could find
themselves weaker than they were even in the 1980s and 1990s.

Amateur Hour at the White House
by Leslie H. Gelb
November 22, 2009 I 10:50pm
The Asia trip was not worth Obama's time. Leslie H. Gelb on why the president should shake up his
foreign policy team—and make sure the deals are done before he leaves home.
President Obama's nine-day trip to Asia is worth a look back to fix two potent problems, past and future. First, the trip's
limited value per day of presidential effort suggests a disturbing amateurishness in managing America's power. On top of
the inexcusably clumsy review of Afghan policy and the fumbling of Mideast negotiations, the message for Mr. Obama
should be clear: He should stare hard at the skills of his foreign-policy team and, more so, at his own dominant role in
decision-making. Something is awry somewhere, and he's got to fix it.
Secondly, the Asia trip presented an important opportunity to carve out a new American leadership role in the world's
most dynamic economic region, and Mr. Obama missed it. He only scratched the surface in his calls for multilateralism
and mutual understanding. He needs to paint pictures of how Washington will help solve regional security and trade
problems. Otherwise, most Asian nations will continue their unwanted drift toward China and away from the United States.
A meditation on his journey should start by forgetting half of the last week's commentary. Unbelievably, some criticized
Obama for not getting China to ""throw its weight around."" What Asian leaders want that? None that I know of. Others
lamented that Obama couldn't make ""demands"" on China anymore. The presumption here is that China is now king, and
that Washington can no longer have its way with Beijing. The facts are that Washington never did boss Beijing around,
and that China is not now ruling the roost (more accurately, it's sitting on its own eggs). Others contended that Obama
continued his pattern of trashing America's friends and coddling its authoritarian enemies like China. It's hard to stomach
this nonsense from the same conservative crowd that forever praised George W. Bush for accommodating China and
alienating America's allies.
Some analysts played fair and acknowledged that administration officials tried to tell reporters not to expect ""deliverables""
on the trip, and to see the journey more as a recognition of Asia's new importance and America's desire for a new co-
operative spirit. That's a commendable thought, but hardly justification for almost two weeks of the president's time (when
you consider preparations)— especially when he's got a tanking economy, health-care reform woes, and decisions to
make on Afghanistan. Presidents take trips like this one only when they need breakthroughs and accomplishments on
certain issues that can't be agreed on without the pressure of an impending presidential visit. In fact, most presidents
wouldn't even commit to trips abroad without knowing that key deals would be finally agreed on and announced during the
visit itself. The prospective visit is the power jackhammer to nail down the deals. Just take a gander at trips planned for
Richard Nixon by Henry Kissinger or for George H. W. Bush by James Baker.
Obama's travels were a chance to settle or make concrete progress on thorny issues like greenhouse-gas emissions, and
the fate of U.S. bases on Okinawa, which the new Japanese government insists on moving. It was time to announce ways
to gain fixes on the U.S.-South Korean trade treaty, long stalled in Congress. It was a moment to show that Beijing would
actually make some mutually beneficial compromises on exchange rates or economic sanctions against Iranian and North
Korean nuclear programs. Absent guarantees of progress on issues such as these, Mr. Obama should have taken a well-
deserved vacation in Hawaii.
Matters were made worse on the scene. It was not good optics for Obama to bow to Japan's emperor. He seems to do
this stuff spontaneously and inexplicably, as with his bow to the Saudi King some months ago. And it was truly unfortunate
that Obama and his aides didn't flatly insist that he be allowed to address the Chinese people directly on television and
meet with non-stacked Chinese groups—as has been the case during previous presidential visits. Beijing's leaders
obviously didn't feel confident enough of their own standing at home to give the popular Mr. Obama such access. But he
and his team should have made it a precondition of the visit. Its absence left an unhappy taste.
The Asia trip presented an important opportunity to carve out a new American leadership role in the world's most dynamic
economic region, and Mr. Obama missed it.
The White House might try to blame the State Department (such an easy and delicious target) for the missteps. But
State's role in the conceptual planning of the trip was not central, and the department's senior Asia hand, Kurt Campbell,
surely knew better. It's also hard to tar the National Security Council's own senior Asia expert, Jeff Bader, another pro like
Campbell. Perhaps even higher officials at the NSC dropped the ball. Perhaps Mr. Obama might take responsibility
himself, as President Kennedy did after the Bay of Pigs fiasco in 1961. Now, that would truly clear the air—and open the
door to some obvious and necessary changes in the administration's decision-making machinery. Every decision, large
and small, is shaped and made by the president himself and enforced by Denis McDonough, a deputy NSC adviser and
the administration's Lord High Executioner. Does Obama get enough pushback? Is he hearing a range of views? Can he
see that his powerful intellect might profit from bowing to the voices of experience? If Mr. Obama reflects on the Asia
journey and other mishaps, he might loosen the reins and bring in additional policy and diplomatic pros as inside
counselors or outside advisers.
If most Asia hands inside and outside the government had designed the Obama trip, here's what they would have
advised: Go beyond the usual and trite message of building mutual understanding and cooperation, and stop invoking the
God of Multilateralism without spelling out America's leadership role. Asia is now overflowing with multilateral
organizations. Washington is a member of a few key ones, like Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation and the Asian
Development Bank. But that has little to do with other new and key groupings such as the Shanghai Cooperation
Organization (Russia, China, Uzbekistan, etc.) and ASEAN, the association of Southeast Asian nations. Asian nations are
increasingly organizing themselves into these groups, and Washington hasn't really figured out its role. Most Asian
nations want that role to be a prominent one—in fact, the leadership position. They're afraid of China, afraid that China
won't be as attentive to their concerns in the future as America was in the past. At the same time, they don't want
Washington to come into these groupings and cause problems with Beijing. They want Washington to figure out a
leadership position constructed on the proven American ability to help solve common problems in the common interest.
They want an America they remember, one that can get things done and doesn't let problems fester.
That U.S. policy was the main missing ingredient on Obama's trip. Washington played architect and solidified its
leadership in Europe after World War II with NATO, the Marshall Plan, and various trade and economic organizations like
the World Bank. Asian nations are yearning for the same kind of creativity today from a brilliant American president in the
new Pacific Era.

The worst is yet to come: Unemployed
Americans should hunker down for more job
losses
BY Nouriel Roubini
Sunday, November 15th 2009, 4:00 AM
Think the worst is over? Wrong. Conditions in the U.S. labor markets are awful and worsening. While the official
unemployment rate is already 10.2% and another 200,000 jobs were lost in October, when you include discouraged
workers and partially employed workers the figure is a whopping 17.5%.
While losing 200,000 jobs per month is better than the 700,000 jobs lost in January, current job losses still average more
than the per month rate of 150,000 during the last recession.
Also, remember: The last recession ended in November 2001, but job losses continued for more than a year and half until
June of 2003; ditto for the 1990-91 recession.
So we can expect that job losses will continue until the end of 2010 at the earliest. In other words, if you are unemployed
and looking for work and just waiting for the economy to turn the corner, you had better hunker down. All the economic
numbers suggest this will take a while. The jobs just are not coming back.
There's really just one hope for our leaders to turn things around: a bold prescription that increases the fiscal stimulus with
another round of labor-intensive, shovel-ready infrastructure projects, helps fiscally strapped state and local governments
and provides a temporary tax credit to the private sector to hire more workers. Helping the unemployed just by extending
unemployment benefits is necessary not sufficient; it leads to persistent unemployment rather than job creation.
The long-term picture for workers and families is even worse than current job loss numbers alone would suggest. Now as
a way of sharing the pain, many firms are telling their workers to cut hours, take furloughs and accept lower wages.
Specifically, that fall in hours worked is equivalent to another 3 million full time jobs lost on top of the 7.5 million jobs
formally lost.
This is very bad news but we must face facts. Many of the lost jobs are gone forever, including construction jobs, finance
jobs and manufacturing jobs. Recent studies suggest that a quarter of U.S. jobs are fully out-sourceable over time to other
countries.
Other measures tell the same ugly story: The average length of unemployment is at an all time high; the ratio of job
applicants to vacancies is 6 to 1; initial claims are down but continued claims are very high and now millions of
unemployed are resorting to the exceptional extended unemployment benefits programs and are staying in them longer.
Based on my best judgment, it is most likely that the unemployment rate will peak close to 11% and will remain at a very
high level for two years or more.
The weakness in labor markets and the sharp fall in labor income ensure a weak recovery of private consumption and an
anemic recovery of the economy, and increases the risk of a double dip recession.
As a result of these terribly weak labor markets, we can expect weak recovery of consumption and economic growth;
larger budget deficits; greater delinquencies in residential and commercial real estate and greater fall in home and
commercial real estate prices; greater losses for banks and financial institutions on residential and commercial real estate
mortgages, and in credit cards, auto loans and student loans and thus a greater rate of failures of banks; and greater
protectionist,pressures.
The damage will be extensive and severe unless bold policy action is undertaken now.

US fumbling for a new China tone
Published: November 16 2009 20:39 I Last updated: November 16 2009 20:39
Gone are the days when the US president could visit Beijing as the unassailable top dog, able to lecture the Chinese on
everything from human rights to an overvalued currency. As has become fashionable to note, events have instead obliged
Barack Obama to play the role of washed-up debtor visiting his stern bank manager for yet another loan.
That analogy is useful. But it can be overdone. Certainly, the financial crisis has brought into sharp relief just how
dependent the US has become on foreign creditors, chief among them China.
It has also sharpened the perception of what had been happening anyway, the relative decline of a US-centric west and
the relative rise of a China-centric Asia. But the word relative is important. China, poor and riddled with internal
contradictions, is not there yet, by a very long way.
The changing relationship with China does demand a new tone. But early indications are that Mr Obama is still fumbling
for the right one. Take global imbalances.
In the only set-piece speech of his Asian tour — delivered in Japan, perhaps to assure his hosts that Washington is not
abandoning Tokyo just yet — Mr Obama correctly pointed out that the global economy cannot go back to business as
usual. ""One of the important lessons this recession has taught us is the limits of depending primarily on American
consumers and Asian exports to drive growth,"" he said.
That is quite right. But his entreaties on global rebalancing fall flat in China. That is partly because Beijing remains publicly
sceptical about the US's long-term finances.
From China's perspective, Mr Obama's emergency measures to stimulate the US economy and persuade Americans to
spend their way out of recession smack of re-creating the spendthrift ways that triggered the crisis in the first place.
That explains why Chinese officials have quizzed their US counterparts so robustly about how they intend to pay for
healthcare reform. It is also why Beijing has started questioning US monetary, as well as fiscal, policy.
On the eve of the US president's visit, Liu Mingkang, China's chief banking regulator, took a swipe at the US Federal
Reserve, saying the combination of a weak dollar and low interest rates risked generating a global asset bubble. That is a
bit rich coming from someone who oversees a banking system that has pumped the equivalent of nearly 30 per cent of
gross domestic product into the economy so far this year. But it reflects the new tone with which China presumes it can
address a humbled superpower.
Mr Obama's efforts to occupy the moral high ground are also undermined by his flirtation with protectionism, particularly
his decision to slap tariffs on Chinese tyres.
His administration has failed to spell out a convincing trade policy — and that is seen as a stark omission for-a business-
oriented Asian audience. Such perceived deficiencies have hobbled his ability to cajole China with any real conviction.
When it comes to human rights, too, the US seems to have drawn the conclusion it is not good policy to badmouth its
chief creditor.
Hillary Clinton, secretary of state, set the tone early when she said that human rights should not ""interfere"" with matters of
implicitly greater urgency. Mr Obama obligingly omitted all references to Tibet, Xinjiang and even Taiwan from his Tokyo
speech. There was also not a single mention of India, a potential regional counterweight to China, yet another indication
that Washington is behaving as though it is treading on eggshells. It was therefore all the more refreshing to hear Mr
Obama criticise Chinese censorship during his town hall meeting in Shanghai on Monday — though even that could not
undo his own self-censorship in refusing to meet the Dalai Lama before this week's trip.
It is right and proper that the US acknowledge the rising significance of China. Mr Obama's assurances that China's rise
need not be a threat were spot on. But by the same token, US accommodation can be taken too far. Contrary to common
perception, China's huge holdings of US treasuries are not a sign of great strength. They are evidence of how dependent
Chinese growth has been on the US consumer.
Equally, any idea that China, with an economy less than a third the size of the US and a GDP per capita roughly the same
as Angola's, can somehow save the world is ludicrous. Mr Obama is right to show respect to China. He need not — and
must not — kowtow.

Expert Brief
The U.S.-China Economic Relationship: Separating Facts from Myths
Steven Dunaway, Adjunct Senior Fellow for International Economics

Former deputy director of the Asia and Pacific department at the International Monetary Fund. Author

http://www.cfr.org/publication/20757/uschina_economic_relationship.html?breadcrumb=°/02Fregion%2F271%2Fchina
Many myths surround the economic relationship between the United States and China. Four, in particular, stand out, and
it is important to identify them as myths to avoid misunderstandings that could adversely influence policy decisions. The
fact that China has become the largest foreign holder of U.S. government securities is taken as indicating that the United
States is heavily dependent on China to finance its budget deficits. Similarly, since China is a major source for U.S.
imports, U.S. consumers are seen as dependent on cheap Chinese goods. In addition, the Chinese authorities have
emphasized that they strongly resist external pressures to try to influence policy decisions and that economic instability in
China is bad, with adverse implications for the rest of the world.
Taken together, these four myths could lead to the conclusion that China should not be pushed hard by the United States
(or other major countries) to more quickly change its policies, especially its exchange rate policy, to facilitate the
rebalancing of its economy. But such a conclusion would be a major mistake, and that is why during his trip to Asia,
President Barack Obama needs to dispel these myths and bring pressure to bear for faster economic policy changes in
China. This would be in keeping with the objectives for dealing with global imbalances laid out by the G-20 summit in
Pittsburgh in September 2009.
Myth No. 1: Washington has limited leverage because China is the main ""banker"" for the United States
China holds a large amount of U.S. government securities. Of China's $2.3 trillion in official reserves, it is estimated that
70 percent is held in U.S. dollar assets. China is a big customer for U.S. debt, but it is not America's banker. Nor is the
United States dependent on China to finance its budget deficits. If China elects not to buy U.S. Treasuries, there are other
willing public and private sector buyers, as indicated by the strong demand for these securities worldwide. Although the
U.S. government might have to pay higher interest rates as an incentive to get other investors to buy Treasuries in the
event that the Chinese reduce their demand, the increase in interest rates would likely be small.
Major consequences from a decision by China to reduce its purchases of U.S. Treasury securities would depend on the
reason behind the decision. It would be in China's best interest (and beneficial for the rest of the world as well) if China
reduced its purchases of U.S. Treasuries because it decided to stop heavily managing its exchange rate and allow greater
flexibility in the currency's movements. This is an important policy change that is required if China is going to rebalance its
economy and be able to sustain rapid growth.
China is a big customer for U.S. debt, but it is not America's banker. Nor is the United States dependent on China to
finance its budget deficits.
If instead China continues to heavily manage its exchange rate, it will build up large additional amounts of official
reserves. If it decides to hold less of these additional reserves in U.S. Treasury securities, then China will increase its
purchases of assets denominated in other currencies, with euro-denominated securities being the most likely alternative.
In these circumstances, China would continue to intervene in its exchange market, with the central bank buying U.S.
dollars for Chinese renminbi and then selling dollars for euro to acquire European assets. The result would be an
appreciation of the euro. Consequently, countries in Europe, not the United States, would probably be most affected by
China's move because the negative impact of euro appreciation on European economic activity would likely far outweigh
the effects on the United States of smaller Chinese purchases of Treasuries.
Alternatively, China could choose to start dumping its stock of U.S. securities. The result would be appreciation of other
major currencies (depending on where China would decide to park its reserve assets); upward pressure on U.S. interest
rates; and the possibility of financial market disruptions if China dumped its U.S. dollar assets rapidly. However, the U.S.
Federal Reserve could limit the rise in U.S. interest rates and would be able to ensure adequate liquidity to prevent market
disruptions. But a decision to dump Treasuries would have a large effect on China itself. The country would incur a
substantial capital loss on its reserve assets. The Chinese authorities are deeply concerned about such a loss, and are
very unlikely to decide to dump U.S. assets. In fact, the discussion initiated by China regarding the need for an alternative
official reserve asset is motivated by its concerns about potential losses on its U.S. dollar holdings.
Myth No. 2: The United States is heavily dependent on cheap Chinese goods
This is not really true. Only roughly 15 percent of U.S. imports come from China. Moreover, all of the basic types of
manufactured consumer goods that China exports to the United States (clothing, textiles, footwear, toys, small appliances,
etc.) can be imported from other countries or could be produced domestically. The prices for goods that could substitute
for products from China would be higher, but the difference in costs would be relatively small. Competition among
producers has become fiercer, and as a result cost differentials between goods from China and other suppliers are
narrowing.
Dependence actually runs the other way. China is highly dependent on U.S. demand for its products. Economic growth in
China is heavily dependent on exports. Although China has been able to achieve its 8 percent GDP growth target in 2009
owing to the stimulus to domestic demand provided by government policy actions, the country will struggle to meet this
objective in 2010 and succeeding years if demand for its exports in the United States does not pick up.
Myth No. 3: External pressure on China for policy changes is counterproductive.
The Chinese authorities stress that in the face of external pressure, they tend to strongly resist economic policy changes.
The Chinese have in particular used this argument to try to fend off pressures for appreciation of the exchange rate. While
no country wants to appear to be weak and susceptible to external pressure, the truth is that, if there is no pressure, there
is less incentive to change policy. This is especially true in China, where the authorities are wedded to the status quo
because of past success and inclined to make only gradual changes to economic policies. Recent developments in
China's exchange rate illustrate this point. In the absence of external pressure since August 2008, China has reverted to
fixing its exchange rate relative to the U.S. dollar.
Without a hard push from the United States on a bilateral and multilateral basis, changes in China's policies are likely to
be delayed, and that is not in the best interest of the United States and the rest of the world.
Myth No. 4: Instability is bad for China
Chinese authorities also have suggested that instability in China is bad for the rest of the world because of adverse effects
on China's growth rate. But instability (or the fear of instability) has played a big role in initiating economic policy changes
in China. For example, concern about instability arising from the growing gap between urban and rural incomes has been
a major factor behind new initiatives to develop China's interior (such as the Develop the West program) and to improve
conditions and opportunities for the rural population (including breaking down restrictions and discriminatory treatment of
migrant workers). Hence, for China, instability is not necessarily bad, but it is a problem for the authorities. Instability in
China also is not necessarily bad for the rest of the world because of its effect on China's growth. Although China
accounts for a significant portion of world GDP growth, the country does not generate much demand for products from
other countries given China's large trade and current account surpluses. Some countries in Asia and commodity
producers may be benefiting from China's strong growth, but overall, it is not providing much stimulus for the world
economy as a whole, so slower growth in China will have little effect on economic activity in the rest of the world.
It is important for President Obama to separate fact from myth in his economic policy discussions with the Chinese
authorities during this trip to Asia to build a sounder relationship. The president should not shy away from pushing the
Chinese hard on economic reform and rebalancing of China's economy, but this should be done in his private discussions
with China's senior leaders. Multilateral discussions, such as those in the context of the G-20 process, are a much more
effective forum for the United States to take a public stance on China's economic policies jointly with other major
economies.
Without a hard push from the United States on a bilateral and multilateral basis, changes in China's policies are likely to
be delayed, and that is not in the best interest of the United States and the rest of the world. It also is not in the best
interest of China, because without a shift away from heavy dependence on investment and exports to drive growth toward
greater reliance on consumption, China will not be able to sustain rapid economic growth and development. Getting China
to fully realize this and to act more quickly than the authorities are inclined to do is a considerable task for the United
States and other major economies.","['Asia', 'Pacific', 'United', 'States', 'China', 'China', 'U.S.', 'United', 'States', 'China', 'China', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'China', 'China', 'United', 'States', 'Asia', 'China', 'Pittsburgh', 'Washington', 'China', 'United', 'States', 'China', 'U.S.', 'China', 'U.S.', 'China', 'U.S.', 'America', 'United', 'States', 'China', 'China', 'U.S.', 'China', 'China', 'China', 'U.S.', 'China', 'China', 'U.S.', 'America', 'United', 'States', 'China', 'China', 'U.S.', 'China', 'China', 'U.S.', 'Europe', 'United', 'States', 'China', 'United', 'States', 'China', 'U.S.', 'China', 'U.S.', 'China', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'China', 'U.S.', 'China', 'U.S.', 'United', 'States', 'U.S.', 'China', 'China', 'United', 'States', 'China', 'China', 'China', 'U.S.', 'China', 'China', 'United', 'States', 'China', 'China', 'China', 'China', 'U.S.', 'United', 'States', 'China', 'United', 'States', 'China', 'China', 'China', 'China', 'China', 'China', 'China', 'China', 'China', 'China', 'Asia', 'China', 'China', 'Asia', 'China', 'China', 'United', 'States', 'China', 'United', 'States', 'China', 'United', 'States', 'China', 'China', 'China', 'United', 'States']"

Rep. Joe Wilson's Rebel Yell
Inside the racist klavern that Joe Wilson joined
By Max Blumenthal
Since Republican Rep. Joe Wilson of South Carolina bellowed at President Barack
Obama, ""You lie!"" during the president's nationally televised speech on healthcare,
the fourth term backbencher has emerged as a hero among the conservative
grassroots. One of the most enthusiastic endorsements of Wilson's histrionics came
from the Sons of Confederate Veterans (SCV), a group that Wilson has <a
href=http://crooksandliars.com/david-neiwert/obama-heckler-joe-wilson-member-
neo>belonged to</a> for several years.
""Mr. Wilson, never apologize for allowing your love of truth to overrun your desire
to be polite,"" the SCV Tea Party <a
href=http://scvteaparty.com/?p=165>declared</a> on its website. ""It is the liar who
must apologize, not the one who identifies the liar!""
Who are the SCV? A once-proud organization of Confederate history buffs and re-
enactors who spent their organization's money to restore Civil War-era battlefields
and Confederate cemeteries, by 2006 the SCV was substantially <a
href=http ://www. sp lcenter. org/inte l/intelreport/artic le .j sp?pid=1027 >taken
over</a> by an organized cadre of white supremacist radicals (read <a
href=http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?pid=154 >here</a> for
more background) who sought to turn the nation's oldest Southern historical society
into what the veteran white supremacist activist Kirk Lyons called ""a modern, 21st
century Christian war machine capable of uniting the Confederate community and
leading it to ultimate victory."" When the racist junta had seized much of the SCV's
leadership positions, the Southern Poverty Law Center released an <a
href=http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?sid=90 >extensive
list</a> of SCV officials who belonged to ""hate groups.""
Lyons, a key leader of the white supremacists who took over the SCV, had <a
href=hftp://www.thenation.com/doc/20050829/blumenthal/single >harbored
dreams</a> of creating a seemingly benign front group for a more sophisticated
version of the Ku Klux Klan. ""I have great respect for the Klan historically, but,
sadly the Klan today is ineffective and sometimes even destructive,"" Lyons told a
German neo-Nazi magazine in 1992. ""It would be good if the Klan followed the
advice of former Klansman Robert Miles: 'Become invisible. Hang the robes and
hoods in the cupboard and become an underground org anization.'"" With the SCV,
Lyons discovered he didn't have to go underground after all.
Once Lyons helped install his close friend, Ron Wilson, as president of the SCV,
the organization's political newsletter, <a href=http://fpacscv.org/southernmercury/
>The Southern Mercury</a> (where Wilson served as senior editor), transformed
into a propaganda mill for crude white supremacist cant. Mailed to all dues-paying
members of the SCV — presumably including Rep. Joe Wilson — until it went
defunct in 2008, the Mercury has published articles describing blacks as genetically
inferior to whites, calling African-Americans as ""a childlike people,"" and warned
that if Obama runs for re-election, race riots of an ""exceedingly violent nature""
would immediately ensure, leaving ""entire sections of some of our cities in ruins.""
Here are a few highlights from the Southern Mercury:
""After the turn of the 20th century, the white Southerners had disfranchised and segregated
the blacks, in perhaps the mildest reaction possible at=2 Othat time to the blacks' transgressions.
The blacks — then a childlike people — had been selling their votes to the Democrats en masse for
$.25 apiece in national elections.""
--""Where We Stand Now, And How We Got Here,"" by Frank Conner, Southern Mercury,
September/October 2003
""Previously, anthropologists had routinely recorded the notable differences in IQ among
the races; but at Columbia, a liberal cultural anthropologist named Franz Boas...decreed that
there were no differences in IQ among the races, and the only biological differences between the
blacks and whites were of superficial nature... Meanwhile, the liberals in the media heaped
special praise upon black athletes, musicians, singers, and writers — and treated them as typical
of the black race. The liberals were creating a false image of the blacks in America as a highly
competent people who were being held back by the prejudiced white Southerners.""
--Conner, September/October 2003
""It is very clear to me that if Barack Obama should be elected President, he would be
extremely anti-white and would demand reparations for slavery and press hard for affirmative
action to the degree that it would hurt young whites who were seeking jobs or admission to
College and Graduate Schools.""

riots. If he were running for re-election, these riots would turn into an exceedingly violent nature
that would seriously damage race relations in America, and leave entire sections of some of our
cities in ruins.""

Rep. Joe Wilson could have resigned from the SCV as soon as the organization's
takeover by open white supremacists began. But he didn't. Or he could have
withdrawn his membership when the SCV's flagship journal turned into a racist rag.
But he didn't. Instead, while serving as a state senator, Wilson led an SCV-inspired
campaign in 2000 to keep the Confederate flag flying above South Carolina's state
capitol. ""The Southern heritage, the Confederate heritage, is very honorable,""
Wilson <a href=http ://news. bbc . co .uk/2/hi/americas/503579.stm>proclaimed</a> at

(SBU) Reports about an alleged lethal incident along the line of contact in Nagorno-Karabakh remain
unconfirmed. The potential implications on the peace process are not yet clear. At the moment, regional
leaders are responding cautiously and the impact on other regional processes does not appear
significant. The Armenian Ministry of Defense denied any unusual activity along the line of contact; the
Azerbaijan Ministry of Defense told media that incidents are frequent along the line of contact. Embassy
Yerevan reports that it is customary to deny reports of sniper incidents along the line of contact, but that an
incident of this magnitude would be difficult to cover up. Embassy Baku notes that President Aliyev is in
Kazakhstan and local authorities could be waiting for his return before deciding on how to proceed. Neither of

Hitting Bottom in Foggy Bottom
The State Department suffers from low morale, bottlenecks, and bureaucratic ineptitude. Do we need to kill it to save it?
BY MATTHEW ARMSTRONG I SEPTEMBER 11, 2009
Discussion over the fate of Foggy Bottom usually focuses on the tenure of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the troubles
of public diplomacy, and the rise of special envoys on everything from European pipelines to Afghanistan and Pakistan.
But Americans would benefit more from a reassessment of the core functionality of the U.S. State Department.
Years of neglect and marginalization, as well as a dearth of long-term vision and strategic planning, have left the 19th-
century institution hamstrung with fiefdoms and bureaucratic bottlenecks. The Pentagon now funds and controls a wide
range of foreign-policy and diplomatic priorities -- from development to public diplomacy and beyond. The world has
changed, with everyone from politicians to talking heads to terrorists directly influencing global audiences. The most
pressing issues are stateless: pandemics, recession, terrorism, poverty, proliferation, and conflict. But as report after
report, investigation after investigation, has highlighted, the State Department is broken and paralyzed, unable to
respond to the new 21st-century paradigm.
But how did it get so bad? Is it possible to fix? Or should we just push it over the wall like a great Humpty Dumpty and
reassign the pieces?
There is growing evidence that the internal machinations of the State Department have corrupted its ""core missions"" of
traditional diplomacy and public diplomacy. This year, for example, the Government Accountability Office (gao) found
that the department completely failed in its now four-year-old attempt to reorganize its nonproliferation bureau (a
bureau that remains leaderless). Besides failing to address mission overlap, low morale, and lack of career opportunities,
the failed reorganization caused a significant drop in expertise in offices focused on proliferation issues -- including
""today's threats posted by Iran, North Korea, and Syria,"" the gao's report said -- and coordination with bodies like the
International Atomic Energy Agency.
Another report by the State Department's inspector general this year described severe and broad dysfunction within the
Africa bureau, while ignoring -- perhaps considering it a given -- the lack of departmentwide integration and leadership
in operations. Examples of the dysfunction range from not providing public diplomacy personnel with computers
capable of reading interoffice memos to a failure to effectively work with the new Africa Command.
By necessity, the Defense Department has stepped in where State Department has tuned out: Foggy Bottom relies on
Pentagon funding and even personnel for basic operations central to its mission. For example, the Defense Department
now performs much strategic communications work traditionally the purview of the State Department. In Somalia, for
example, the State Department's budget for public diplomacy is $30,000. The Pentagon's is $600,000. And, in the State
Department's bureaucratic wisdom, the $30,000 does not even belong to its undersecretary for public diplomacy and
public affairs.
Further, rivalries between the different ""cones"" -- or career tracks, referred to by one insider as the ""conal caste system""
-- at the State Department severely impact morale, career growth, and even operations. The report on the Africa bureau
noted that in 2002, public affairs and public diplomacy was a ""failed office"" -- and that the situation is worse in 2009.
Public outreach workers said the bureau's leadership ""does not understand public diplomacy."" The sentiment is
widespread. A 2008 report by a congressional ombudsman, the U.S. Advisory Commission on Public Diplomacy,
described a systemic failure to support and train public diplomacy officers in the field, as well as professional
discrimination against those in the career track.
Attempts to fix the State Department have focused on short-term issues, such as ameliorating its shortages in human
and financial resources. The last eight secretaries of state have attempted to bolster the department by bolstering its
bottom line. No less than Defense Secretary Robert Gates and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. Mike
Mullen, have long suggested transferring funds from the Defense Department to State Department. But the situation is
so dire that the State Department, at this point, could not even absorb and spend that much-needed infusion of cash. If
there were a wholesale transfer of funds tomorrow, the lack of capacity and skills at the State department would mean
it would have to give it back to the Defenk Department or dole it out to contractors.
The creeping militarization of U.S. foreign policy is itself deeply worrying, not just to Gates and Mullen, but also to such
luminaries as Secretary Clinton and Vice President Joe Biden. In 2008, then-Senator Biden questioned the ""expanding
role of the military in U.S. foreign policy."" He said he was concerned by the ""migration of functions and authorities from
U.S. civilian agencies to the Department of Defense.""
Some commentators have even wondered aloud whether the best way to fix the State Department might be to destroy
it. Foggy Bottom could retain a small core staff for its embassies and ambassadors. All other functions -- such as public
diplomacy, countering misinformation and propaganda, and development, including provincial reconstruction staffing --
could migrate to the Pentagon or become wholly independent agencies.
But atomizing the State Department would ultimately prove dangerous and further the militarization of foreign policy.
The Pentagon needs a counterbalance, a vertically integrated State Department that the president, Congress, and the
U.S. public can count on. Change, rather than creative destruction, is what Foggy Bottom needs.
Envision a State Department capable of leading whole-of-government initiatives with a strategic focus instead of one
hidebound department geared by structure and tradition to execute state-to-state diplomacy. This ""Department of State
and Non-State"" would be as deft at tackling stateless terrorist networks and hurricanes as it would be at fostering and
upholding alliances with foreign ministers. To transform Foggy Bottom in this way will require breaking the rigid
hierarchy, stovepipes, and bottlenecks which make the Pentagon look lean and dynamic in comparison.
Modern global affairs are not compartmentalized by political borders. Besides expanding the overly shallow and narrow
authorities of the public diplomacy bureau, Clinton must restructure the State Department to focus less on countries
and more on regions. Currently, each of Foggy Bottom's regional bureaus, such as Near East Affairs, is configured to
oversee its patch of embassies. Country desk officers, and most ambassadors, report to an assistant secretary, the
regional head. The assistant secretary in turn reports to an undersecretary, who reports to Clinton.
Clinton should name the regional bureau heads, currently assistant secretaries, to undersecretary status. This would
help eliminate an unnecessary bureaucratic layer and would also align the State Department with the Defense
Department (which has powerful regional commands, such as Centcom and Africom). The State Department's regional
leaders would hold an equivalent civilian rank to four-star combatant commanders like Gen. David Petraeus. These
changes would promise to improve communications, synchronize missions, and put the department on the right path for
today's requirements.
But Clinton should beware reforming the State Department too quickly from within -- her efforts could be paralyzed by a
bureaucracy in mutiny that would simply wait her out. U.S. national security would suffer and the Pentagon's growing
power would become more entrenched. Clinton will need the clear and unequivocal support of the president and more
importantly Congress, which authorizes State Department spending bills, to have a chance at success.
In a burst of activity after Barack Obama's election, Congress authorized more money and people for the
State Department and pushed for greater public diplomacy. Still more is required. The question asked over the last eight
years as the State Department abrogated its various responsibilities -- if not Defense, then who? -- will not, indeed
cannot, be answered until the department steps up to the plate and becomes effective and visible in leading and
implementing U.S. foreign policy. This will take time. But, as the saying goes, there is no time like the present. The
United States now has a Congress that supports change, secretaries of state and defense who want change, a president
whose entire election platform was built around the word ""change,"" and an American public that would be outraged at
the dysfunction if it only knew the details.

last weekend's post-coup presidential election.

Previously, the government had said it would not recognize the election unless Zelaya was returned to office and allowed to serve out his term,
which ends Jan. 27.
Rousseff told Brazilian television late Friday from Germany that the coup ""is one thing"" and ""discussing the election"" another.

Black in the Age of Obama
By CHARLES M. BLOW
A hundred and fifty years ago, Charles Dickens opened ""A Tale of Two Cities"" with the now-famous phrase:
""It was the best of times, it was the worst of times. ...""
Those words resonated with me recently while contemplating the impact of the Obama presidency on blacks in
America. So far, it's been mixed. Blacks are living a tale of two Americas — one of the ascension of the first
black president with the cultural capital that accrues; the other of a collapsing quality of life and amplified racial
tensions, while supporting a president who is loath to even acknowledge their pain, let alone commiserate in it.
Last year, blacks dared to dream anew, envisioning a future in which Obama's election would be the catalyst for
an era of prosperity and more racial harmony. Now that the election's afterglow has nearly faded, the hysteria of
hope is being ground against the hard stone of reality. Things have not gotten better. In many ways, they've
gotten worse.
The recession, for one, has dealt a particularly punishing and uneven hand to blacks.
A May report from the Pew Research Center found that blacks were the most likely to get higher-priced
subprime loans, leading to higher foreclosure rates. In fact, blacks have displaced Hispanics as the group with
the lowest homeownership rates.
According to the most recent jobs data, not only is the unemployment rate for blacks nearly twice that of whites,
the gap in some important demographics has widened rapidly since Obama took office. The unemployment rate
over that time for white college graduates under 24 years old grew by about 20 percent. For their black cohorts,
the rate grew by about twice that much.
And a report published last month by the Department of Agriculture found that in 2008, ""food insecurity"" for
American households had risen to record levels, with black children being the most likely to experience that
food insecurity.
Things on the racial front are just as bad.
We are now inundated with examples of overt racism on a scale to which we are unaccustomed. Any protester
with a racist poster can hijack a news cycle, while a racist image can live forever on the Internet. In fact, racially
offensive images of the first couple are so prolific online that Google now runs an apologetic ad with the results
of image searches of them.
And it's not all words and images; it's actions as well. According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation's 2008
hate crimes data released last week, anti-black hate crimes rose 4 percent from 2007, while the combined hate
crimes against all other racial categories declined 11 percent. If you look at the two-year trend, which would
include Obarna's ascension as a candidate, anti-black hate crimes have risen 8 percent, while those against the
other racial groups have fallen 19 percent.
This has had a sobering effect on blacks. According to a Nov. 9 report from Gallup, last summer 23 percent of
blacks thought that race relations would get a lot better with the election of Obama. Now less than half that
percentage says that things have actually gotten a lot better.
The racial animosity that Obama's election has stirred up may have contributed to a rallying effect among
blacks. According to a Gallup report published on Nov. 24, Obama's approval rating among whites has dropped
to 39 percent, but among blacks it remains above 90 percent.
Also, this hasn't exactly been a good year for black men in the news. Plaxico Burress was locked up for
accidentally shooting off a gun in a club. Henry Louis Gates Jr. was locked up for intentionally shooting off his
mouth at his own home. And Michael Jackson died after being shot full of propofol. Chris Brown brutally beat
Rihanna. Former Representative William Jefferson was convicted. And most recently, the ""personal failings"" of
Tiger Woods portray him as an alley cat. Meanwhile, the most critically acclaimed black movie of the year,
""Precious,"" features a black man who rapes and twice impregnates his own daughter. Rooting for the president
feels like a nice counterbalance.
However, the rallying creates a conundrum for blacks: how to air anxiety without further arming Obama's
enemies. This dilemma has rendered blacks virtually voiceless on some pressing issues at a time when their
voices would have presumably held greater sway.
This means that Obama can get away with doing almost nothing to specifically address issues important to
African-Americans and instead focus on the white voters he's losing in droves. This has not gone unnoticed. In
the Nov. 9 Gallup poll, the number of blacks who felt that Obama would not go far enough in promoting efforts
to aid the black community jumped 60 percent from last summer to now.
The hard truth is that Obama needs white voters more than he needs black ones.
According to my analysis, even if every black person in America had stayed home on Election Day, Obama
would still be president. To a large degree, Obama was elected by white people, some of whom were more able
to accept him because he consciously portrayed himself as racially ambiguous.
In fact, commiserating with the blacks could prove politically problematic.
In a study to be published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of the Sciences this month,
researchers asked subjects to rate images of the president to determine which ones best represented his ""true
essence."" In some of the photos, his skin had been lightened. In others, it had been darkened. The result? The
more people identified him with the ""whiter"" images, the more likely they were to have voted for him, and vice
versa.
The Age of Obama, so far at least, seems less about Obama as a black community game-changer than as a
White House gamesman. It's unclear if there will be a positive Obama Effect, but an Obama Backlash is
increasingly apparent. Meanwhile, black people are also living a tale of two actions: grin and bear it.

Chinese New Year
By PAUL KRUGMAN
It's the season when pundits traditionally make predictions about the year ahead. Mine concerns international economics:
I predict that 2010 will be the year of China. And not in a good way.
Actually, the biggest problems with China involve climate change. But today I want to focus on currency policy.
China has become a major financial and trade power. But it doesn't act like other big economies. Instead, it follows a
mercantilist policy, keeping its trade surplus artificially high. And in today's depressed world, that policy is, to put it bluntly,
predatory.
Here's how it works: Unlike the dollar, the euro or the yen, whose values fluctuate freely, China's currency is pegged by
official policy at about 6.8 yuan to the dollar. At this exchange rate, Chinese manufacturing has a large cost advantage
over its rivals, leading to huge trade surpluses.
Under normal circumstances, the inflow of dollars from those surpluses would push up the value of China's currency,
unless it was offset by private investors heading the other way. And private investors are trying to get into China, not out
of it. But China's government restricts capital inflows, even as it buys up dollars and parks them abroad, adding to a $2
trillion-plus hoard of foreign exchange reserves.
This policy is good for China's export-oriented state-industrial complex, not so good for Chinese consumers. But what
about the rest of us?
In the past, China's accumulation of foreign reserves, many of which were invested in American bonds, was arguably
doing us a favor by keeping interest rates low — although what we did with those low interest rates was mainly to inflate a
housing bubble. But right now the world is awash in cheap money, looking for someplace to go. Short-term interest rates
are close to zero; long-term interest rates are higher, but only because investors expect the zero-rate policy to end some
day. China's bond purchases make little or no difference.
Meanwhile, that trade surplus drains much-needed demand away from a depressed world economy. My back-of-the-
envelope calculations suggest that for the next couple of years Chinese mercantilism may end up reducing U.S.
employment by around 1.4 million jobs.
The Chinese refuse to acknowledge the problem. Recently Wen Jiabao, the prime minister, dismissed foreign complaints:
""On one hand, you are asking for the yuan to appreciate, and on the other hand, you are taking all kinds of protectionist
measures."" Indeed: other countries are taking (modest) protectionist measures precisely because China refuses to let its
currency rise. And more such measures are entirely appropriate.
Or are they? I usually hear two reasons for not confronting China over its policies. Neither holds water.
First, there's the claim that we can't confront the Chinese because they would wreak havoc with the U.S. economy by
dumping their hoard of dollars. This is all wrong, and not just because in so doing the Chinese would inflict large losses on
themselves. The larger point is that the same forces that make Chinese mercantilism so damaging right now also mean
that China has little or no financial leverage.
Again, right now the world is awash in cheap money. So if China were to start selling dollars, there's no reason to think it
would significantly raise U.S. interest rates. It would probably weaken the dollar against other currencies — but that would
be good, not bad, for U.S. competitiveness and employment. So if the Chinese do dump dollars, we should send them a
thank-you note.","['China', 'China', 'China', 'China', 'China', 'China', 'China', 'China', 'China', 'China', 'U.S.', 'China', 'China', 'U.S.', 'China', 'China', 'U.S.', 'U.S.']"

Women and work

Dec 30th 2009
From The Economist print edition
The rich world's quiet revolution: women are
gradually taking over the workplace
Getty Images
AT A time when the world is short of causes for celebration, here is a candidate:
within the next few months women will cross the 50% threshold and become the
majority of the American workforce. Women already make up the majority of
university graduates in the OECD countries and the majority of professional
workers in several rich countries, including the United States. Women run many
of the world's great companies, from PepsiCo in America to Areva in France.
Women's economic empowerment is arguably the biggest social change of our
times. Just a generation ago, women were largely confined to repetitive, menial
jobs. They were routinely subjected to casual sexism and were expected to
abandon their careers when they married and had children. Today they are
running some of the organisations that once treated them as second-class
citizens. Millions of women have been given more control over their own lives.
And millions of brains have been put to more productive use. Societies that try to
resist this trend—most notably the Arab countries, but also Japan and some
southern European countries—will pay a heavy price in the form of wasted talent
and frustrated citizens.
This revolution has been achieved with only a modicum of friction (see article).
Men have, by and large, welcomed women's invasion of the workplace. Yet even
the most positive changes can be incomplete or unsatisfactory. This particular
advance comes with two stings. The first is that women are still under-
represented at the top of companies. Only 2% of the bosses of America's largest
companies and 5% of their peers in Britain are women. They are also paid
significantly less than men on average. The second is that juggling work and
child-rearing is difficult. Middle-class couples routinely complain that they have
too little time for their children. But the biggest losers are poor children—
particularly in places like America and Britain that have combined high levels of
female participation in the labour force with a reluctance to spend public money
on child care.
Dealing with the juggle
These two problems are closely related. Many women feel they have to choose
between their children and their careers. Women who prosper in high-pressure
companies during their 20s drop out in dramatic numbers in their 30s and then
find it almost impossible to regain their earlier momentum. Less-skilled women
are trapped in poorly paid jobs with hand-to-mouth child-care arrangements.
Motherhood, not sexism, is the issue: in America, childless women earn almost as
much as men, but mothers earn significantly less. And those mothers' relative
poverty also disadvantages their children.
Demand for female brains is helping to alleviate some of these problems. Even if
some of the new theories about warm-hearted women making inherently superior
workers are bunk (see article), several trends favour the more educated sex,
including the ""war for talent"" and the growing flexibility of the workplace. Law
firms, consultancies and banks are rethinking their ""up or out"" promotion systems
because they are losing so many able women. More than 90% of companies in
Germany and Sweden allow flexible working. And new technology is making it
easier to redesign work in all sorts of family-friendly ways.
Women have certainly performed better over the past decade than men. In the
European Union women have filled 6m of the 8m new jobs created since 2000. In
America three out of four people thrown out of work since the ""mancession""
began have been male. And the shift towards women is likely to continue: by
2011 there will be 2.6m more female than male university students in America.
The light hand of the state
All this argues, mostly, for letting the market do the work. That has not stopped
calls for hefty state intervention of the Scandinavian sort. Norway has used
threats of quotas to dramatic effect. Some 40% of the legislators there are
women. All the Scandinavian countries provide plenty of state-financed nurseries.
They have the highest levels of female employment in the world and far fewer of
the social problems that plague Britain and America. Surely, comes the argument,
there is a way to speed up the revolution—and improve the tough lives of many
working women and their children?
If that means massive intervention, in the shape of affirmative-action
programmes and across-the-board benefits for parents of all sorts, the answer is
no. To begin with, promoting people on the basis of their sex is illiberal and
unfair, and stigmatises its beneficiaries. And there are practical problems. Lengthy
periods of paid maternity leave can put firms off hiring women, which helps
explain why most Swedish women work in the public sector and Sweden has a
lower proportion of women in management than America does.
But there are plenty of cheaper, subtler ways in which governments can make life
easier for women. Welfare states were designed when most women stayed at
home. They need to change the way they operate. German schools, for instance,
close at midday. American schools shut down for two months in the summer.
These things can be changed without huge cost. Some popular American charter
schools now offer longer school days and shorter summer holidays. And, without
going to Scandinavian lengths, America could invest more in its children: it
spends a lower share of its GDP on public child-care than almost any other rich
country, and is the only rich country that refuses to provide mothers with paid
maternity leave. Barack Obama needs to measure up to his campaign rhetoric
about ""real family values"".
Still, these nagging problems should not overshadow the dramatic progress that
women have made in recent decades. During the second world war, when
America's menfolk were off at the front, the government had to summon up the
image of Rosie the Riveter, with her flexed muscle and ""We Can Do It"" slogan, to
encourage women into the workforce. Today women are marching into the
workplace in ever larger numbers and taking a sledgehammer to the remaining
glass ceilings.","['Japan', 'Korea', 'Japan', 'United', 'States', 'America', 'France', 'Japan', 'America', 'Britain', 'America', 'Britain', 'America', 'Germany', 'Sweden', 'America', 'America', 'Norway', 'Britain', 'America', 'Sweden', 'America', 'America', 'America']"

Subjects:
• Democracy and government
• International politics
More openDemocracy authors reflect on a volcanic decade in global politics - continued from part I
openDemocracy deputy editor David Hayes asked openDemocracy writers to reflect on the decade that has passed and
the one that lies ahead by considering three questions:
1)What was the most significant trend in the century's first decade?
2) What do you most hope for, and most fear, about the decade to come?
3) What idea do you see fading and/or emerging in 2010 and beyond?
• Sidney Blumenthal
The greatest challenge for the early 21st century is that China's leadership has contempt for much of the international
order and many of the international organisations developed since the second world war. In pursuit of its narrow and even
crude understanding of its interest, China will constantly abuse and break international rules, protocols and bodies. Its
willful destruction of the Copenhagen summit on climate change reveals the pattern. Its mercantile currency policy in a
beggar-thy-neighbour approach, environmental degradation, and disdain for human rights and the rule of law generally
are the obvious reflections of its despotism. Through its rough and strange neo-imperialism, in Africa especially but also
elsewhere, China is able to gain help, partly through economic intimidation, in its international forays to repel or strike
down the responsibilities of internationalism.
Internally, China is a prison of nations, an empire similar to imperial Russia and the Soviet Union, and may also be the
most unequal industrial country in distribution of income. China's power is increasing, but the authoritarian regime is
hardly the wave of the future as some awestruck worshippers of raw power and money (whether investment bankers or
ex-Marxists) imagine. The system is inherently unstable, which accounts for its rigid currency policy (at root a fear of
operating on other than a virtual slave-labour standard, of turning its poverty-stricken millions into consumers with real
choice, and ultimately of letting go even a little bit).
In the long-term the tyranny of the one-party state and its military rule is at odds with the new economic classes of
entrepreneurs and professionals it has fostered. China's growing economic power is accompanied by expanding
arrogance, demonstrated not least in the incivility and rudeness with which President Obama was treated on his trip there.
China's regime lacks an ideal other than a communist gloss on Confucian uniformity, itself based incoherently on reckless
economic development, for example in the areas of currency, environment and labour; it has no ""soft power"", not just
because of the coarseness of its supposed diplomacy, but also because its cultural appeal does not travel. China forces
its way through coercion of one sort or another.
The next decade will see how flexible or inflexible its rulers are and how secure their system is. The brief effort at a
rhetorical gesture by some in the Obama administration who floated the turgid phrase ""strategic reassurance"" was risible
and did not last. For now, the west has no policy to deal with China as it is. The place to begin is on currency.
The most powerful idea for the 21st century is the equality of women. It is the idea most feared by those - from the Vatican
to the Taliban - arrayed against modernity, the still vibrant project of the Enlightenment. Someday the United States may
even have a woman president. It took fifty years after granting the vote to African-Americans to pass a constitutional
amendment giving it to women. Perhaps the distance between electing the first African-American president and the first
female one will not be so great.

3468,"The Next Six Months - Work PlanI. Introduction
The next six months will be a critical time for establishing the Department's leadership in
bridging relationships for U.S. intergovernmental officials and their foreign counterparts,
defining the mission and role of the Office of the Special Representative for Global
Intergovernmental Affairs (""S/SRGIA""), and outlining an agenda that serves the needs of the
Department and these officials. Our approach will be strategic and integrated, working in
collaboration with Department bureaus and USAID offices to strengthen and deliver on the
Secretary's and Administration's priorities.
II. Key Objectives
The Special Representative for Global Intergovernmental Affairs will serve the global
needs of the U.S. intergovernmental officials and the entities they represent. The S/SRGIA will
also connect U.S. state and local officials with intergovernmental officials around the world,
promote local capacity building investments and programs to enhance country-led processes, and
facilitate the needs and goals of intergovernmental officials here and abroad consistent with
Department priorities.
III. Next Steps
This work plan describes activities that the S/SRGIA plans to initiate, grow and
implement in the next six months. To place the Work Plan in context, we describe below
S/SRGIA' s work-planning process.
A. Establish S/SRGIA Mission and Role in the Department.
Currently, no one and no office in the State Department has accountability to serve the
needs of intergovernmental officials, (e.g., Governors, Mayors, local elected leaders, the entities
that represent them) with respect to their global affairs portfolios. State and local officials'
concerns are typically routed on an individual basis through bureaus with the results reflecting ,
the priority of the person in the bureau's estimation or the nature of the request. Priority
activities will be as follows:
1
Sensitive But Unclassified
• Confirm the Secretary's support to focus on priority issues and countries;
• Join Department's meetings and conversations with visiting foreign state and local
representatives and dignitaries to establish S/SRGIA's role;
• Strengthen support on global intergovernmental affairs issues internally in the State
Department, by explaining the value of these stakeholders;
• Track deployment of resources assisting intergovernmental officials and leverage the
State Department's collective U.S. and global intergovernmental relationships;
• Follow and interpret international issues (e.g., food security, global health, climate
change, trade and economic development, energy) of importance to state governments;
• Promote dialogue between the Department (e.g., USAID, EEB, ECA, Public Private
Partnerships, Global Women's Issues, Consular Affairs, MCC and targeted Regional
Bureaus) and external constituents (e.g., Governors, Mayors, local elected officials, and
the entities that they represent) for more effective partnerships and relationships; and
• Collaborate with the Public Diplomacy and INR to create a survey of foreign
intergovernmental affairs officials to determine their needs and engage U.S.
intergovernmental officials to learn how the Department should help to further their
global goals.
B. Conduct Stakeholder Outreach: Obtain first-hand understanding of the needs of
U.S. intergovernmental officials.
State economies are increasingly globalized, and more and more U.S. companies are
competing in international markets and against firms worldwide. As the principal stewards of
their states' economic success, Governors recognize that the global marketplace presents both
challenges and opportunities and that states must address both to ensure their continued
competitiveness. Thus, S/SRGIA will develop its global intergovernmental affairs outreach
activities in partnership with its participating US and other intergovernmental and international
organizations. U.S. national organizations who serve governmental authorities include but are
not limited to the following:
• National Governors Association;
• National Lt. Governors Association;
• U.S. Conference of Mayors;
• National League of Cities;
• National Association of Counties/Large Urban County Caucus;
• National Association of States Attorney Generals;
• National State Legislatures; and
• Councils of State Governments.
Outreach is essential to many aspects of the Department's activities. S/SRGIA's outreach
objective is to promote and increase the general awareness of the benefits of the State
Department efforts in global intergovernmental affairs, especially among decision makers and
policy makers, educational entities, non-governmental organizations, public-interest groups and
public agencies. S/SRGIA will provide international outreach services to state and local elected
officials in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and all other inhabited U.S.
territories. Specific objectives are to:
2
Sensitive But Unclassified
• Build state by state profiles, thus creating a set of priorities and identifying opportunities
for collaboration with state and local officials on their global projects and Department
priorities;
• Establish our target list of public officials to assist and nurture relationships with
principals and the organizations that represent them and their global needs;
• Create dialogue with the Governors and Mayors in preparation for the NGA and Mayors
Washington conferences in the fall;
• Travel to conferences and meetings within the United States and countries abroad
required to implement the Department's global intergovernmental affairs agenda;
• Develop a network of leaders, to collaborate and create partnerships;
• Coordinate meetings between Department of State experts and state and local officials;
• Support targeted elected officials trade missions and other official trips abroad;
• Develop a strategy for deliverables such as multilateral pacts and Memorandum of
Understandings on key State Department priorities that we will sign with responsible
parties; and
• Collaboration with EEB, to partner with them to engage state and local government
leaders in the bureaus enhanced commercial diplomacy efforts (e.g. the Administration's
National Export Initiative and EEB/Consular Affairs Business Visa Facilitation initiative,
etc.).
C. Conduct Stakeholder Outreach: Obtain first-hand understanding of the needs of
middle and senior foreign intergovernmental affairs officials.
Currently, ECA conducts a significant number of exchanges with foreign and
domestic government officials. None of ECA's programs target regions with the
objective of enhancing another country's government systems because the bureau's
authorities do not permit any type of training since everything must be done under the
auspices of enhancing mutual understanding. The most visible ECA program is the
International Visitor Leadership Program which in FY09 brought in 1,390 foreign
government officials at the state, city and national levels to gain knowledge around the
US political system and culture. To date, the bureau estimates the same number of
government visitors in FY10.
Thus, S/SRGIA will develop its global intergovernmental affairs outreach activities in
partnership with international organizations. International organizations who serve local
governmental authorities include but are not limited to the following:
• United Cities and Local Governments;
• Metropolis;
• The World Urban Forum;
• UN-HABITAT;
• Latin American and Caribbean Ministers of Housing and Urbanization;
• UN Advisory Committee of Local Authorities;
• The World Mayors Council on Climate Change;
3
Sensitive But Unclassified
• Sister Cities International;
• Local Governments for Sustainability; and
• Municipal Development Partnerships which targets governments in Africa.
Priority activities will be as follows:
• S/SRGIA will collaborate with Public Diplomacy to conduct stakeholder outreach
with strategic countries — e.g. Af, Pak, Iraq — and key emerging powers (Brazil,
India, Indonesia, South Africa, Nigeria) and developing countries (Rwanda,
Ethiopia, Kenya, etc.) to obtain first-hand understanding of the needs of middle
and senior foreign intergovernmental affairs officials;
• Collaborate with [NR to assist us in gaining a better understanding of what
foreign intergovernmental affairs officials want to engage with their US
counterparts ranging from engagement on a host of common policy concerns,
opportunities, programs and connections.
D. Provide Leadership for Department Intergovernmental Capacity Building.
One of our largest challenges in most developing countries is the lack of capacity in the
government below the President and Prime Minister level. As the Department seeks to
implement development programs or conduct diplomacy, there is often limited local counterpart
capacity to do so with or to empower. S/SRGIA will work with USAID and State bureaus and
offices to provide connections and leadership development to build the capacity of
intergovernmental officials in countries around the world. Currently, millions of dollars of
USAID and ECA grants that support capacity building are typically carried out by contractors
and have results that are not transparent in their reporting or impact. S/SRGIA will partner with
existing offices to provide leadership for the investment in this space, accountability for the
outcomes and programming, and foster relationships between intergovernmental officials here in
the US with foreign partners to mentor and model what is needed.
S/SRGIA capacity building strategies will primarily be based on best practices derived
from studying successful and less-successful approaches. Within the next six months, S/SRGIA
will work in partnership with Department and USAID bureaus and resources. Priority activities
will be as follows:
• Identify State Department investments, canvass additional State Department dedicated
resources other than grant-making and assess the strength of the current environment
needed to advance the S/SRGIA's Secretary capacity building agenda for state and local
leaders; participate in QDDR process regarding this agenda;
• Develop an agenda for a high-level retreat on the formulation of a National Capacity
Development Strategy to present achievements to date, lessons learned and proposals for
institutional capacity development going forward;
• Work with the Chiefs of Missions and other diplomats in countries where capacity
building is critical to the success of our diplomacy and development efforts;
4
Sensitive But Unclassified
• Amplify and sustain high quality and results driven support to institutional capacity
development by assisting in advocating for increased funding and building public-private
partnerships;
• Prioritize discrete initiatives to ""fast track"", based on importance, regional priorities (e.g.,
Asia, Africa and Latin America), assessment of readiness, impact and feasibility and
translate priorities into actionable interventions;
• Develop a network of experts involved in existing capacity-building initiatives related to
global intergovernmental affairs and build partnerships;
• Define a coordinated approach and institutional responsibilities for supporting the GIA
capacity building initiative; and
• Identify opportunities for further collaboration with state and local officials on their
projects and Department priorities.
IV. Administrative Activities
• Standardize requests for assistance with projects related to policy, business, trade,
consular affairs, etc.; and
• Link the Department website to states websites and trade and development office
websites.
V. Budget and Staffing
S/SRGIA will require a budget and staffing to fulfill its mission.
VI. Assessment of Progress
The short term goal will be to engage U.S. intergovernmental officials about their global
concerns. The S/SRGIA office will become a significant resource for high-level State
Department engagement for U.S. state and local elected officials. The benefits of this new office
will be immediate and grow over time as our engagement deepens. Assisting US states and local
governments to expand their exports, promote locations for foreign investment and for
participation in State Department priorities are some of the short term benefits we hope to
achieve with respect to U.S. intergovernmental officials.
With respect to the global intergovernmental officials, in the short term, we expect to
work with our Regional Bureaus and Offices, (e.g., USAID, ECA, EEB, etc.) to assess the
current state of play and assist us with how we better target and leverage our assistance to this
constituency.
In the longer term, institutionally, we need to sustain relationships with our embassies
and missions overseas, so that they can assist state and local officials and their constituencies to
expand their global business base. As related to our national capacity building strategy, in the
long term, we seek to empower and educate and build relationships with state and local officials
abroad. We also seek accountability for the outcomes of the programming and will provide
leadership for future investments. Going forward, we will tailor these investments to address
regional State Department priorities.
5
Sensitive But Unclassified
In addition, since there is a lack of USG harmonization of all of the relevant USG
programs, having S/SRGIA be the designated coordinator will allow DOS to take the lead in
synchronizing government wide programs that engage foreign government officials. This will be
another long term goal for the office.
VII. Potential Events
A. Potential Events and Activities for S
1. Private Dinner or Luncheon with the Governors and Urban Mayors;
2. Roundtable or Speech at USCMNGA Winter Meetings; and
3. Recommendations of Governors and Mayors for S to extend possible invitations for
occasional international travel with S.
B. Potential Events and Activities SRGIA
1. Host ""Day with State"" with U.S. intergovernmental officials and conduct joint meetings
with various State Department Bureaus and Offices giving stakeholders the ability to
connect and partner with State;
2. Focus Groups with Diplomats from key regions of interest representing Latin America,
Africa, Asia in our development of our capacity building strategy;
3. Meetings with other elected officials and representative organizations;
4. Meetings with NG0s, thinktanks, etc.; and
5. Recommend US intergovernmental officials for appointments to US delegations to State
Department international meetings and conferences.
VIII. Possible Travel for SRGIA
A. Domestic
1. TX, NY, VA, MD, PA, Delaware, D.C. Illinois, Florida, California, Ohio, NJ, Michigan.
States are targeted based on foreign direct investment, export data and states of interest.
B. International
1. Travel to targeted international meetings that focus on engaging state and local leaders;
(e.g. World Urban Forum, Brazil; World Cities Summit 2010, Singapore; World Alliance
of Cities Against Poverty, Rotterdam; 3' Meeting of United Cities and Local
Governments-ASPAC Congress 2010, Japan; Global Mayors Forum, Hong Kong and
Shenzhen, China;
2. Emphasis and travel to Asia, Latin America and Africa countries where capacity building
is critical to the success of our diplomacy and development effort.

and new construction in Judea and Samaria for a period of ten months.
My cabinet authorized this far reaching step because of our deep desire for peace.
We hope that this decision will help launch meaningful peace negotiations to reach a historic peace agreement that will
finally end the conflict between the Palestinians and Israel.
We are committed to working closely with the United States to advance peace and security in the region.
We have been told by many friends that once Israel takes the first step towards peace, the Palestinians and the Arab
world would respond positively with steps of their own to create a virtuous cycle of goodwill.
Well, the government of Israel is taking a very big and difficult step toward peace today.
I hope that the Palestinians and the Arab world will seize this opportunity to work with us to forge a new beginning and
a new future for our children and for their children.
Since the day our government was sworn in eight months ago, we have been calling for direct negotiations with the
Palestinians.
During that time, we have taken many concrete actions to improve daily life for the Palestinians and to create a climate
in which political negotiations would have the best chance to succeed.
We have dismantled hundreds of roadblocks and checkpoints, extended the hours of operation on the Allenby Bridge
and removed bureaucratic obstacles to Palestinian economic development.
These actions have helped spur a surge, a boom, in the Palestinian economy. At the same time, the security
environment has improved thanks both to the efforts of the IDF and to the efforts of better trained PA security forces.
Now we wish to add to this improved economic and security climate meaningful political negotiations.
I have already said that we will not build new settlements and that we would not expropriate additional land for existing
settlements.
I said we would also restrain settlement activity, and that's exactly what we decided to do today.
I promised to enable normal life to continue for the three hundred thousand Israeli citizens, our brothers and sisters,
who live in Judea and Samaria.
That is why this suspension will not affect construction currently underway.
It will not include the schools, kindergartens, synagogues and public buildings necessary for the continuation of normal
life over the time period of the suspension.
Obviously, any infrastructure that may be needed to protect our national security or to safeguard the lives of our citizens
will also be provided during this time.
Regarding Jerusalem, our sovereign capital, our position is well known. We do not put any restrictions on building in our
sovereign capital.
As always, we are committed to protect freedom of worship for all faiths and to ensure equal and fair treatment for all
the city's residents, Jews and Arabs alike.
When the suspension ends, my government will revert to the policies of previous governments in relation to
construction.
I want to say clearly to the Palestinians: Now is the time to begin negotiations. Now is the time to move the peace
process forward. There is no more time to waste.
Israel has taken a far reaching step for peace. It's time for the Palestinians to do the same.","['Judea', 'Samaria', 'Israel', 'United', 'States', 'Israel', 'Israel', 'Allenby', 'Bridge', 'Judea', 'Samaria', 'Jerusalem', 'Israel']"

Poll: Clinton approval soars
By: Eamon Javers
December 16, 2009 03:00 PM EST
A new poll of avid news watchers shows that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has a much higher
approval rating than the man she once campaigned against and now works for, President Barack
Obama.
In the poll of 800 registered voters who are self-identified ""news watchers,"" Clinton had a 75 percent
approval rating and a 21 percent disapproval rating overall. Obama, in contrast, had a 51 percent
approval and a 45 percent disapproval rating.
The Secretary of State has conducted several well-received foreign trips in recent months and has
not been as closely identified with the more contentious elements of the Administration's agenda,
including the health care fight, the federal deficit and the Wall Street bailouts. And she has not been
subjected to nearly the same media and partisan scrutiny as the president. Obama, meanwhile, has
been on national television on a daily basis tackling a wide range of difficult issues.
The poll was conducted by the nonpartisan Clarus Research Group from December 7th to the 12th,
and it asked for opinions of the top Cabinet secretaries and White House officials. Its finding on
Obama and Clinton mirrors that of earlier polls — in October, for example, a Gallup poll found that
Clinton had become more popular than the president.
Clarus president Ron Faucheux said one reason for Clinton's high poll numbers is her high approval
among Republicans — numbers he said position her well to run for president again in the future, if she
chooses. Clinton had 96 percent approval among Democrats, a healthy 57 percent approval among
Republicans, and 65 percent approval among Independents. Obama was nearly as popular among
Democrats — 93 percent — but his numbers among Republicans and Independents fell off
dramatically, at 19 percent and 33 percent respectively.
Clinton's Republican numbers are striking, given how intensely disliked she has been in the past
among GOP voters. In fact, part of Obama's appeal to Democratic primary voters in 2008 was that he
was more likely to be able to bridge the partisan divide than Clinton, who was by then a well-known
figure dating to her time as first lady in the 1990s.
""Republicans may see her as being more hawkish than other Democrats on foreign policy issues,""
said Faucheux. ""It may be a way for them to bolster that position within the administration."" Asked
about any future Clinton presidential bid, he said, ""She's in good shape now.""
The next highest-rated cabinet secretary in the survey was Defense Secretary Robert Gates, who
notched a 69 percent overall approval rate with a 78 percent approval among Democrats and 63
percent among both Republicans and independents.
""Both Clinton and Gates did well across the partisan board,"" said Faucheux. ""Everybody else did well
among Democrats but fell off among Republicans.""
Another trend spotted by the pollsters: Approval ratings inside the Beltway were higher than in the
rest of the country. ""These results show that the 'Beltway echo chamber' does not reflect the rest of
the country, even among news watchers,"" said Faucheux.
Among White House staffers and advisors, Press Secretary Robert Gibbs — who is often seen on
television — had the highest overall rating at 50 percent. Economic advisor Larry Summers had the
lowest approval, at 25 percent.
Summers and Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner — who are both closely associated with the
economy — both posted higher disapproval numbers than approval. Summers' disapproval rating was
41 percent. Geithner's disapproval rating was 45 percent, one point higher than his approval rating.
The poll also found that White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel, who is often viewed as having
sharp partisan elbows, scored much higher among Democrats, at 72 percent, than Republicans, at 13
percent.
Among other major administration officials, Vice President Joe Biden had a 50 percent approval and
41 percent disapproval rating; Attorney General Eric Holder and HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius
both posted 41 percent approval and 35 percent disapproval; Presidential Adviser David Axelrod
scored 38 percent approval and 36 percent disapproval; and National Security Adviser James Jones
had a 30 percent approval and 23 percent disapproval rating.

China sees no chance of climate deal - source
Thu Dec 17, 2009
Print I Single Page
By Krittivas Mukherjee and Pete Harrison
COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - China has told participants in the U.N. climate change talks that it sees no possibility of
achieving an operational accord this week, an official involved in the Copenhagen talks said on Thursday.
Dozens of heads of state are descending on the Danish capital to address the December 7-18 conference, and had hoped
to sign on Friday a new pact to tackle global warming.
The official, who asked not to be identified, told Reuters the Chinese had instead suggested issuing ""a short political
declaration of some sort,"" but it was not clear what that would say.
The official said negotiations were continuing to try to reach a breakthrough that would still allow an operational
agreement to be signed. The official said the sticking point for China appeared to be a process issue.
U.S. President Barack Obama has called for an ""operational accord"" -- essentially a political agreement with teeth that
can get countries working to cut or curb their greenhouse gas emissions while a more formal and binding treaty is
hammered out in 2010.
Some ministers warned that slow, often stalled talks during the summit meant it was staring at failure.
""We may not get there on the substance, it is quite possible we'll fail on the substance, but at least let's give it a try,""
said Britain's energy and climate minister Ed Miliband.
""At the moment the problem is we're not giving it a try.""
Developed and developing nations are at odds over who should cut emissions, how deep the cuts should be, and how
much funding should be provided to poor countries to help them shift to greener growth and adapt to a warmer world.
While the overall picture is bleak, there has been some progress in areas critical to reaching a deal.
Africa dramatically scaled back its expectations for climate aid from rich nations, and Japan pledged about $11 billion
(6.8 billion pound) in public funds to 2012 to help poor countries adapt to a warmer world and cut their emissions.
Talks on a U.N.-backed system to pay poorer nations to curb deforestation have advanced, and the United States
pledged $1 billion in short-term funds to conserve tropical forests.
A major sticking point between the world's top emitters, the United States and China, has been the question of how
they will prove they are sticking to emission-curbing plans.
On Tuesday, China's climate change ambassador warned developed countries against using climate change as an excuse
to set up trade barriers. Yu Qingtai said rich nations should not think that slapping carbon tariffs on imports from
countries with different emissions control regimes would substitute for reaching a global deal to tackle warming.","['China', 'COPENHAGEN', 'China', 'Copenhagen', 'China', 'U.S.', 'Britain', 'Africa', 'Japan', 'United', 'States', 'United', 'States', 'China', 'China']"

2 Brothers' Grim Tale Of Loyalty And Limbo
To Leave Guantanamo Means Abandoning Family
By Del Quentin Wilber
Washington Post Staff Writer
Monday, September 28, 2009
Bahtiyar Mahnut, a detainee at the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay, learned a few weeks ago that the
Pacific island nation of Palau had invited him to settle there.
It should have been cause for celebration, especially for a man who desperately wants to be free. But, to the
surprise of his attorneys, Bahtiyar has turned down the offer. He wishes to remain a prisoner, they say, so he can
look after his older brother, a fellow detainee.
The brothers' saga, as related by their attorneys and military records, could transpire only in the context of
Guantanamo Bay and comes at a critical juncture for the Obama administration, which is struggling to meet a
Jan. 22 deadline to shutter the 223-detainee prison. Their circumstances also highlight the diplomatic difficulties
facing the U.S. government as it tries to find places to send prisoners not destined for terrorism trials in the
United States.
The brothers are Uighurs, residents of China who are considered separatists by Beijing but are not enemies of
the United States. The brothers were picked up separately in Afghanistan and Pakistan soon after the United
States launched attacks against al-Qaeda and the Taliban in retaliation for the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.
Since at least 2003, the U.S. government has tried to find homes for the brothers and 20 other captured Uighurs.
Five went to Albania in 2006; four were sent to Bermuda in June. At one point, U.S. officials were considering
the possibility of resettling Uighurs in the D.C. region, but that plan was scuttled under political pressure. Most
countries have been reluctant to accept Uighurs and risk angering China.
In recent weeks, however, Palau has agreed to accept 12 of the 13 remaining Uighurs, according to the Justice
Department.
The only detainee not invited by Palau was Bahtiyar's older brother, Arkin Mahmud, 45, who has developed
mental health problems that are apparently too serious to be treated in the sparsely populated country, said his
attorney, Elizabeth Gilson.
To make matters worse, according to Gilson and military records, Arkin is a prisoner only because he went
searching for Bahtiyar after the younger brother left their homeland eight years ago.
""This is just very difficult and sad,"" said Abubakkir Qasim, 40, a Uighur freed from Guantanamo Bay in 2006
who considers himself a friend of both brothers.
""Bahtiyar is turning away freedom for his brother,"" Qasim said through an interpreter. ""His brother is only there
because of Bahtiyar. I feel sorry for both of them.""
Five other Uighurs have declined the offer for a variety of reasons, according to one of their attorneys, Susan
Baker Manning. The Justice Department says the government thinks that six to eight Uighurs will go to Palau.
The earliest they could leave would be Thursday, the Justice Department says.
Officials at the Defense and State departments and the Palau Embassy in Washington either declined to
comment or did not return phone messages.
In 2001, Bahtiyar and Arkin, both Muslims, were living with their parents and a younger brother in a small
house in bustling Ghulja in Western China. Arkin is the father of two children, then 8 and 5. The brothers were
not particularly devout but felt oppressed by the government of Beijing, which does not allow worship and
ensures the best jobs go to ethnic Chinese. The brothers were forced to survive as menial tradesmen. Bahtiyar
sold clothes; Arkin repaired shoes.
Bahtiyar wanted to strike out on his own. So, with $700 in his pocket, he headed for Pakistan. But he quickly
ran out of money and couldn't find work. He was worried about being sent back to China until a friend told him
about a group of Uighurs in Afghanistan that wanted ""to fight against the Chinese government.""
""If I went,"" he told military officials, ""I didn't have to pay for food or anything. So I went to Afghanistan.""
There, he lived with 35 other Uighurs in a camp of dusty roads and shacks in the southern mountains. The group
built houses and a mosque. They trained with one automatic rifle and did some push-ups, pull-ups and other
calisthenics, records show.
Within a few weeks of arriving at the camp, Bahtiyar managed to call home. His mother was very worried and
told Arkin to find his brother. ""He left because he was a dutiful son,"" Gilson said.
After the Sept. 11 attacks, the U.S. military began bombing Afghanistan and destroyed Bahtiyar's camp,
sending the Uighurs into the mountains for shelter. Bahtiyar and others crossed into neighboring Pakistan,
where they were arrested and turned over to U.S. authorities.
Meanwhile, Arkin made his way to Afghanistan, where he was captured by the Northern Alliance and turned
over the United States. At a military prison in Kandahar, the brothers saw each other across the razor wire.
In 2002, the military brought the brothers and 20 other Uighurs to Guantanamo Bay. Authorities alleged at the
time that the men trained at military-style camps affiliated with the Taliban or al-Qaeda. The accusations later
dissolved upon close scrutiny by the courts.
Arkin and Bahtiyar were confined in separate cells and, for months, were not able to talk. A Uighur interpreter
working for the military, Rushan Abbas, persuaded the military in 2003 to allow the brothers to meet in an
interrogation room.
When they saw each other, they hugged and wept. ""It was just so emotional,"" Abbas said. ""These brothers from
across the world coming together in an interrogation room for the first time.""
In 2005, Arkin remained in solitary confinement. He had a record of disciplinary infractions and had been
disrespectful to the guards, records show.
Not for the first time, Bahtiyar took steps to help his brother. Living in a more relaxed part of the prison, he was
granted a request to be moved to Arkin's camp. ""I missed my brother so much,"" he told military officials.
By the next year, the brothers had been cleared for release by the military. The government did not present any
evidence to justify their detention in a federal lawsuit brought the Uighurs seeking their freedom. In October, a
judge ordered them freed into the United States, but that decision was overturned on appeal. The Uighurs are
awaiting word, expected this week, on whether the Supreme Court will hear the case.
Last year, the remaining Uighurs were moved to a fenced-in camp that includes an activities room, video games
and books. Through it all, Arkin and Bahtiyar have struggled to cope with being prisoners, perhaps for years to
come. ""I know I'll die in here,"" Arkin told Gilson not long ago. ""In China, at least I would have a trial and
sentence.""
Since taking their case in 2005, Gilson has met with Arkin dozens of times. But she had only spoken to Bahtiyar
by phone. He had refused to meet with her, frustrated by lawyers always talking about what he considered
fruitless legal victories.
Two weeks ago, he changed his mind. Bahtiyar felt that he owed her an explanation for refusing Palau's
generous offer. ""Every day here is an eternity,"" he told Gilson through an interpreter. ""But I have to look out for
my brother.""

hear from everyone, but it will take time to hear from everyone. I've broken it up into 2 sections of an hour

Company over the
weekend:
Iran, China sign a major oilfield deal, Mon, 28 Sep 2009 15:05:09 GMT China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) has signed
a contract with National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) for the development of Iran's South Azadegan oilfield. The Chinese
company will buy a 70 percent share of the whole project, according to an agreement signed Sunday in Lausanne,
Switzerland between CNPC and NIOC's overseas investment subsidiary, Naftiran Intertrade Company (NICO) that covers
a 90 percent stake in the project.
A likely explanation would be that this deal has been long in the making. Still, Tehran's motivation for releasing this
information in English at this time is worth considering.
The whole story from an English-language Iranian outlet is pasted in below, and I found three Chinese-language sources
with corroborating reports (nothing in English from China, though):

Iran, China sign a major oilfield deal
Mon, 28 Sep 2009 15:05:09 GMT
China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) has signed a contract with National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) for the
development of Iran's South Azadegan oilfield.
The Chinese company will buy a 70 percent share of the whole project, according to an agreement signed Sunday in
Lausanne, Switzerland between CNPC and NIOC's overseas investment subsidiary, Naftiran lntertrade Company (NICO)
that covers a 90 percent stake in the project.
CNPC, which won a bid in January to develop the North Azadegan oilfield, now holds a 70 percent share of the project
with NICO holding 20 percent, and Inpex of Japan having the remaining 10 percent.
The South Azadegan project is slated to produce 260,000 barrels of crude oil per day, and its development will cost
around $2.5 billion.
The field, along the Iraqi border, holds reserves estimated at approximately 42 billion barrels of oil, one of the world's
largest finds in the last 30 years.
Iran provides 14 percent of China's demand for oil.
The deal is couched in buy-back terms, in which CNPC will hand over the operation of the field to NIOC after
development and will receive payments from the oil production for a few years to cover its investment.
China's investment in Iran's energy sector has increased as some western countries, led by the US, have sanctioned Iran
over its peaceful nuclear program.

Senate Floor Speech - Surge the Afghan Army
Remarks as prepared for delivery
Today we mark a solemn anniversary. Eight years ago this morning, our nation was attacked by terrorist extremists
motivated by hatred and bent on destruction. It is always appropriate to remember the shock of that day, the innocent
lives lost, and the efforts our nation has made since that day to ensure that Afghanistan, the nation that hosted those
terrorists, cannot again become a safe haven for terrorists seeking to attack us. But today is an especially appropriate
occasion to take stock of those efforts, and consider how best to continue them.
I recently returned from a trip to Afghanistan, where I was joined by my colleagues Senators Jack Reed and Ted
Kaufman. The situation in Afghanistan is serious. Security has deteriorated. But if we take the right steps, we can ensure
that Afghanistan does not revert to a Taliban-friendly government that could once again provide a safe haven for al
Qaeda to terrorize us and the world.
The Obama administration's new strategy, focusing on securing the Afghan population's safety and partnering with the
Afghan security forces in that effort, is an important start at reversing the situation in Afghanistan. The change in
strategy has led our forces, in the words of General McChrystal's Counterinsurgency Guidance, to ""live, eat and train
together [with the Afghan security forces], plan and operate together, depend on one another, and hold each other
accountable....and treat them as equal partners in success."" The Guidance goes on to say that the success of the Afghan
security forces ""is our goal.""
To achieve that goal we should increase and accelerate our efforts to support the Afghan security forces in their efforts
to become self-sufficient in delivering security to their nation — before we consider whether to increase U.S. combat
forces above the levels already planned for the next few months. These steps include increasing the size of the Afghan
Army and police much faster than presently planned; providing more trainers for the Afghan Army and police than
presently planned; providing them more equipment than presently planned; and working to separate local Taliban
fighters from their leaders and attract them to the side of the government as we did in Iraq.
While the security situation in Afghanistan has worsened, we still have important advantages there. The Afghan people
hate the Taliban. Public opinion polls show support for the Taliban at about 5%. In addition, the Afghan army is highly
motivated and its troops are proven fighters.
Despite those advantages, we face significant challenges. General McChrystal believes, and I agree, that we need to
regain the initiative and create a momentum towards success. General McChrystal worries, and rightly so, about the
perception that we have lost that initiative, and the impact of that perception on the Afghan people, their government,
al Qaeda and the Taliban. By contrast, if we can dispel that perception, we have a chance to convince local and lower-
level Taliban fighters to lay down their arms and rejoin Afghan society.
I believe the most effective way to retake the initiative in Afghanistan is with a series of steps to ensure that
Afghanistan's army and police have the manpower, equipment and support to secure their own nation.
First, we should increase troop levels for the Afghan army and police faster than currently planned. There are
approximately 90,000 troops in the Afghan army now, and that number is scheduled to go up to 134,000 by October of
2010. The Afghan police are scheduled to reach a level of 82,000 by the same time. For a long time, many of us have
urged the establishment of a goal of 240,000 Afghan troops and 160,000 Afghan police by 2013. The Afghan Minister of
Defense has strongly supported those numbers. It now appears that our government and the Afghan government are
prepared to accept those goals. But the need for additional Afghan forces is urgent. I believe it both possible and
essential to advance those goals by a year, to 2012.
Our own military in Afghanistan has repeatedly pointed to a need for more Afghan forces. In one sector of Helmand
province we visited last week, our Marines outnumbered Afghan soldiers by 5 to one. A Marine Company commander in
Helmand province told the New York Times in July that a lack of Afghan troops ""is absolutely our Achilles heel.""
What do we need to do to increase the size of the Afghan army and police? According to Afghan Defense Minister
Wardak, there is no lack of Afghan manpower; we've been assured it is available.
But we will need significantly more trainers. We asked General Formica, who is in charge of the American effort to train
Afghan security forces, whether such an increase is possible. He indicated he would make an assessment of what would
be necessary in order to meet the earlier timetable. In the meantime, we should also press our NATO allies with much
greater forcefulness to provide more trainers. If our NATO allies are not going to come through with the combat forces
they have pledged, at least they could provide additional trainers.
Larger Afghan security forces will also require more mid-level Afghan officers. In addition to supporting efforts to
graduate more Afghan officers from army academies, we should consider the recommendation of Defense Minister
Wardak that previous mid-level officers who fought the war against the Soviets return to service on an interim basis.
Minister Wardak emphasized that those men are well qualified and well motivated, and while they may not be trained in
the most current tactics, they nonetheless could temporarily meet the need of the enlarged army while the new group
of officers is trained. A larger Afghan force will need supporting infrastructure, such a barracks. While the available
infrastructure may not be the most modern, it is adequate and exists in sufficient amounts.
Larger Afghan security forces will require additional equipment. There must be a major effort to transfer a significant
amount of the equipment that is coming out of Iraq to the Afghan army and police. Such a significant commitment to
equip the Afghan security forces would also help demonstrate U.S. determination to take the initiative and create
momentum in the right direction. There is an enormous amount of equipment coming out of Iraq; our military is calling
it one of the greatest transfers of military goods in the world's history. A significant part of it could be transferred to the
Afghan forces, increasing their capability without weakening our own readiness. And yet there does not seem to be that
kind of a crash effort in place to do that. We need to obtain on an urgent basis a list of the basic equipment needs of the
Afghan forces and a list of how those needs could be met in a major program to transfer equipment leaving Iraq.
Rapidly expanding Afghanistan's military and police forces would address one of the major problems and risks we now
face there. General McChrystal told us he worries that waiting until 2013 for a larger Afghan force creates a gap in
capabilities that brings significant risk of failure. But by accelerating the training and equipping of Afghan forces by a
year, we address his concern. Depending on additional capability from Afghan, rather than U.S., forces, also addresses a
major problem of public perception in Afghanistan. The larger our own military footprint there, the more our enemies
can seek to drive a wedge between us and the Afghan population, spreading the falsehood that we seek to dominate a
Muslim nation.
Finally, we should make a concerted effort to separate the local Taliban from their leaders. In Iraq, large numbers of
young Iraqis who had been attacking us switched over to our side and became the ""Sons of Iraq."" They were drawn in
part by the promise of jobs and amnesty for past attacks, and in part by the recognition that the status quo was creating
horrific violence in their own communities. In their own interests and the interests of their nation, they switched sides
and became a positive force.
That same prospect exists in Afghanistan. Afghan leaders and our military say that local Taliban fighters are motivated
largely by the need for a job or loyalty to the local leader who pays them and not by ideology or religious zeal. They
believe an effort to attract these fighters to the government's side could succeed, if they are offered security for
themselves and their families, and if there is no penalty for previous activity against us.
General McChrystal himself has emphasized the potential of such re-integration to accomplish the same result as was
achieved in Iraq. Here is what General McChrystal said on July 28th:
""Most of the fighters we see in Afghanistan are Afghans, some with foreign cadre with them. But most we don't see are
deeply ideological or even politically motivated; most are operating for pay; some are under a commander's charismatic
leadership; some are frustrated with local leaders. So I believe there is significant potential to go after what I would call
mid- and low-level Taliban fighters and leaders and offer them re-integration into Afghanistan under the constitution.""
But this ""game changing"" possibility was apparently not factored into General McChrystal's assessment. There is no plan
yet to put in place a Sons of Iraq approach in Afghanistan. It is urgent that we lay out the steps that need to be taken to
involve local and national Afghan leaders in that effort. They alone can accomplish this crucial job, but first we and our
Afghan allies must draft such a plan on an urgent basis. And the potential positive impact of such a plan should be taken
into account as we consider the need for any additional U.S. military resources.
Afghanistan's people are grateful for our aid, but also eager to assume responsibility for their future. In a tiny village in
Helmand Province, we were invited to meet with the village elders at their council meeting, their shura. One hundred or
so men sat on the floor and chatted with us about their future and their country's future. When asked how long the
United States should stay, one elder said: ""Until the moment that you make our security forces self-sufficient. Then you
will be welcome to visit us, not as soldiers but as guests.""
Helping Afghanistan achieve self-sufficiency in their security is everybody's goal. On that there is little difference of
opinion, in Afghanistan's village councils or in the corridors of this Capitol.
Can we help Afghanistan reach self-sufficiency in security fast enough? Can we get there in a way that regains the
initiative and creates the momentum we need? Can we encourage those lower level Taliban to abandon an insurgency
headed by terrorists whose fanaticism they don't share?
I believe we can, by supporting a far more rapid growth in the Afghan Army and police; by providing more trainers more
quickly; by a rapid infusion to Afghan units of equipment no longer needed in Iraq; and by rapidly adopting a plan for the
re-integration of lower level Taliban fighters into Afghan society. In other words, we need a surge of Afghan security
forces.
Our support of their surge will show our commitment to the success of a mission that is clearly in our national security
interest, without creating a bigger U.S. military footprint that provides propaganda fodder for the Taliban.
I believe that taking those steps on an urgent basis, while completing the previously planned and announced increase in
U.S. combat forces, provides the best chance of success for our mission: preventing Afghanistan from again being run by
a Taliban government which harbors and supports Al-Qaeda, whose goal is to inflict additional catastrophic attacks on
the United States and the world. And we should implement these steps before considering an increase in U.S. ground
combat forces beyond what is already planned by the end of this year.","['Afghanistan', 'Afghanistan', 'Afghanistan', 'Afghanistan', 'Afghanistan', 'Afghanistan', 'U.S.', 'Iraq', 'Afghanistan', 'Afghanistan', 'Afghanistan', 'Afghanistan', 'Helmand', 'Helmand', 'Iraq', 'U.S.', 'Iraq', 'Iraq', 'Afghanistan', 'U.S.', 'Afghanistan', 'Iraq', 'Iraq', 'Afghanistan', 'Iraq', 'Afghanistan', 'Afghanistan', 'Iraq', 'Afghanistan', 'U.S.', 'Afghanistan', 'Helmand', 'Province', 'United', 'States', 'Afghanistan', 'Afghanistan', 'Afghanistan', 'Iraq', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'Afghanistan', 'United', 'States', 'U.S.']"

`Appointing Blair as EU president will have
consequences', warns Hague
William Hague's strident attack on his fellow Briton reportedly left some of the EU ambassadors baffled
Francis Elliott, David Charter and Tom Baldwin
William Hague has been conducting a behind-the-scenes campaign to convince European ambassadors that Tony Blair
would be a bad choice for European Union president, The Times has learnt. The Shadow Foreign Secretary used a lunch
organised by the Swedish presidency in London last week to lobby the most senior diplomats of the 26 other EU nations
against the appointment.
EU leaders had hoped to choose the new president at next week's summit, but the Czech Republic's last-minute
objections to the Lisbon treaty have scuppered that. President Sarkozy of France wants a quick decision, however, and is
understood to be pushing for a special one-day summit in Brussels next month to fill the new post.
In making the Conservatives' case against Mr Blair, Mr Hague said that while in Downing Street the former Prime Minister
had consistently placed a higher priority on US interests than on those of Europe. Mr Hague also reminded the diplomats
of Mr Blair's actions in the run-up to the Iraq war, according to one of those attending the lunch last Thursday.
A claim that Mr Hague told the ambassadors that the Tories would regard Mr Blair's appointment as a ""declaration of war""
by the EU was denied, however. A spokesman for Mr Hague said that the phrase was ""a bit strong"". Nevertheless, it was
not disputed that Mr Hague made clear that the move would have consequences for relations between Britain and
Brussels. Diplomats said that there was a ""clear mark of hostility"".
""Mr Hague wanted to leave the ambassadors in no doubt that the Conservative Party is opposed to the appointment of
Tony Blair as president of the European Council and [that] it would only underline the lack of accountability and legitimacy
involved in the creation of the position in the first place,"" Mr Hague's spokesman said. Mr Hague's strident attack on his
fellow Briton reportedly left some of the ambassadors baffled.
Mr Hague is currently in Washington for talks with members of the Obama Administration, including Hillary Clinton, the
Secretary of State, with whom he raised the issue of the Conservatives' membership of a right-wing alliance of European
parties with allegedly anti-Semitic members. He accused critics of running a smear campaign against some of the group,
led by Michal Kaminsky, head of Poland's Law and Justice Party.","['Hague', 'EU', 'Hague', 'Europe', 'Hague', 'London', 'London', 'Czech', 'Republic', 'Lisbon', 'France', 'Brussels', 'Downing', 'Street', 'US', 'Europe', 'Iraq', 'Britain', 'Brussels', 'Mr', 'Hague', 'Washington', 'Poland']"

Calls to Brown and Northern Ireland Political Leaders
PM Brown has asked to brief you on ongoing negotiations convened by the UK and Irish
governments yesterday with FM Peter Robinson and dFM Martin McGuinness and their
respective teams, which lasted until 3:30 a.m. in the morning and resumed at 9:00 a.m. today.
Sinn Fein and the DUP are apparently not yet meeting face to face at Hillsborough but using the
two governments as go betweens. On-site observers have characterized the current atmosphere
between the two parties as ""poisonous.""
B6
were invited to Hillsborough yesterday night. However, these
parties tell us that this was only an informational exercise and they have yet to be included in
any substantive meetings.
Outstanding Issues: The obstacle to progress seems to be centered on the parades issue and
setting of specific dates for devolution. Robinson and the DUP are insisting on the abolishing
of the Parades Commission, an independent panel despised by the Orange Order as restricting
their desire to parade through nationalist areas, and the adoption of a new process relying on
local councils to refer potentially contentious parades to an OFM/dFM selected panel. Sinn
Fein and SDLP are both concerned that this will politicize decision-making on parades and
PSNI involvement.
In late December, the UK government renewed the Parades Commission's mandate until
December 2010, so it is expected that any new process would not be implemented until after the
summer 2010 parading season.

Outcomes: If McGuinness resigns (likely along with the other SF ministers) thereby collapsing

Statement by the Secretary
On the Restoration of Democratic and Constitutional Order In Honduras November 27, 2009
The United States remains committed to help restore the democratic and constitutional order in Honduras in the wake
of the June 28 coup d'etat that removed President Zelaya and led to the suspension of Honduras from the Organization
of American States. As part of that effort, it is essential for both parties in Honduras to implement the measures they
agreed to in the Tegucigalpa-San Jose Accord, including the formation of a government of unity and national
reconciliation and the December 2 congressional vote on President Zelaya""s restitution. These are vital elements of the
Tegucigalpa-San Jose Accord, and the Honduran people and the international community expect an expeditious
determination. We look forward to the Congressional deliberations getting underway as announced.
The November 29 national elections are another critical step in the restoration of the democratic and constitutional
order in Honduras. The electoral process -- launched well before June 28 and involving legitimate candidates
representing parties with longstanding democratic traditions from a broad ideological spectrum -- is conducted under
the stewardship of the non-partisan Supreme Electoral Tribunal, which was also selected before the coup. The electoral
renewal of presidential, congressional and mayoral mandates, enshrined in the Honduran constitution, is an inalienable
expression of the sovereign will of the citizens of Honduras. We wish the Honduran people well as they choose their
new leaders on Sunday, and we urge all sides to exercise their rights peacefully.
The holding of a free, fair and transparent election is necessary but not sufficient for Honduras to reestablish the
democratic and constitutional order. In order to help achieve that objective, we will continue, along with others in the
region, to support the step-by-step implementation of the Tegucigalpa-San Jose Accord as a democratic way forward for
the Honduran people. The president-elect who emerges from an election deemed free and fair will have a unique
opportunity to promote that vital mission.","['Honduras', 'Honduras', 'United', 'States', 'Honduras', 'Honduras', 'Honduras', 'Honduras', 'Honduras', 'Honduras']"

3665,"Below is from the Economist blogger re efforts wil EU to discredit Ashton, particularly from the French. Wouldn't hurt to
mention her positively with French interlocutors. See particularly this line: ""There is, frankly, a whiff of old boy's
network against Lady Ashton: she is not a lifetime member of the honourable guild of former foreign
ministers, and she is surrounded by men in suits who think they know a lot more about foreign policy than
she does. There is not much sympathy for her complicated family life, involving young children, and much
commuting between Brussels and Britain.""
A blog by the author of our column on the European Union
Charlemagne's notebook
. Why did Lady Ashton take the EU's foreign policy job?
• Jan 26th 2010, 22:04
NOT yet February, and the briefing against Catherine Ashton, the newly appointed EU foreign policy chief,
is getting nasty. Jean Quatremer, the Brussels blogger and well-connected EU correspondent of Liberation,
dropped another depth charge against the baroness tonight. His list of complaints against her is long, and
I have a feeling some of them are a smidgeon exaggerated. I find it hard to believe it is literally
impossible to reach Lady Ashton after eight o'clock in the evening as Mr Quatremer charges, because she
allegedly has her mobile telephones diverted to the EU situation centre (a small intelligence analysis cell
staffed by officers from national servicies) after that hour. I also have some doubts about the stress laid
on the fact that she has not yet got round to having top secret security clearance yet, so cannot see any
confidential papers. As a former British cabinet minister, and serving UK commissioner, something tells
me the British at least may share just the odd secret with her.
A senior official I saw today also made the point that any holder of Lady Ashton's post would currently be
struggling with teething problems and squabbling as the new foreign policy apparatus created by the
Lisbon Treaty takes shape. There is, frankly, a whiff of old boy's network against Lady Ashton: she is not a
lifetime member of the honourable guild of former foreign ministers, and she is surrounded by men in
suits who think they know a lot more about foreign policy than she does. There is not much sympathy for
her complicated family life, involving young children, and much commuting between Brussels and Britain.
Finally, at the risk of sounding too loyal to the British, I think Mr Quatremer is being unfair when he says
that it suits the Foreign Office in London to have Lady Ashton ""sabotage"" the post. My impression is that
aritich nnvornmpni- fPPlc I (iv Achtnn nePdc a lot of sunnort riaht now and worries she is not getting
enough support, but at the same time worries that if she receives too much help in the way of briefings
and advice from British officials, she will be seen as a British stooge. That may be a self-serving sort of
fear (because it allows the British to offer Lady Ashton lots of help) but it is real enough.
Other charges probably have something to them. They certainly chime with things I have been told by
other people.
But most damaging, to my mind, is the intimate nature of some of the briefing: this stuff is coming from
officials close to Lady Ashton, or who are senior enough to have significant contact with her. And I can
confirm from my own conversations that people across the whole EU foreign policy machine are asking the
same question: why did she take this huge job, when her instinct seems to be to make it as low key as
possible? That is a dangerous question mark to have hanging over you.","['Brussels', 'Britain', 'Brussels', 'UK', 'Brussels', 'Britain', 'London', 'EU']"

How do I know China wrecked the Copenhagen
deal? I was in the room
As recriminations fly post-Copenhagen, one writer offers a fly-on-the-wall account of how talks faded
0
0 Mark cvnas
o c.
..q,uk, Tuesday 22 December 2009 19.54 GMT
Copenhagen was a disaster. That much is agreed. But the truth about what actually happened is in danger of being lost
amid the spin and inevitable mutual recriminations. The truth is this: Chrs.a wrecked the talks, intentionally humiliated
Barack Obama, and insisted on an awful ""dear so western leaders would walk away carrying the blame. How do I know
this? Because I was in the room and saw it happen.
China's strategy was simple: block the open negotiations for two weeks, and then ensure that the closed-door deal made
It look as if the west had failed the world's poor once again. And sure enough, the aid agencies, civil society movements
and environmental groups all took the bait. The failure was ""the inevitable result of rich countries refusing adequately and
fairly to shoulder their overwhelming responsibility"", said Christian Aid. ""Rich countries have bullied developing nations,""
fumed Friends of the Earth International.
All very predictable, but the complete opposite of the truth. Even George IVIonbiot, writing in yesterday's Guardian, made
the mistake of singly blaming Obama. But I saw Obama fighting desperately to salvage a deal, and the Chinese delegate
saying ""no"", over and over again. Monbiot even approvingly quoted the Sudanese delegate Lumumba Di-Aping, who
denounced the Copenhagen accord as ""a suicide pact, an incineration pact, in order to maintain the economic dominance
of a few countries"".
Sudan behaves at the talks as a puppet of China; one of a number of countries that relieves the Chinese delegation of
having to fight its battles in open sessions. It was a perfect stitch-up. China gutted the deal behind the scenes, and then
left its proxies to savage it in public.
Here's what actually went on late last Friday night, as heads of state from two dozen countries met behind closed doors.
Obama was at the table for several hours, sitting between Gordon Brown and the Ethiopian prime minister, Males Zenawi.
The Danish prime minister chaired, and on his right sat Ban Ki-moon, secretary-general of the UN. Probably only about 50
or 60 people, including the heads of state, were in the room. I was attached to one of the delegations, whose head of
state was also present for most of the time.
What I saw was profoundly shocking. The Chinese premier, Wen Jinbao, did not deign to attend the meetings personally,
instead sending a second-tier official in the country's foreign ministry to sit opposite Obama himself. The diplomatic snub
was obvious and brutal, as was the practical implication: several times during the session, the world's most powerful
heads of state were forced to wait around as the Chinese delegate went off to make telephone calls to his ""superiors"".
Shifting the blame
To those who would blame Obama and rich countries in general, know this: it was China's representative who insisted
that industrialised country targets, previously agreed as an 80% cut by 2050, be taken out of the deal. ""Why can't we even
mention our own targets?"" demanded a furious Angela Merkel. Australia's prime minister, Kevin Rudd, was annoyed
enough to bang his microphone. Brazil's representative too pointed out the illogicality of China's position. Why should rich
countries not announce even this unilateral cut? The Chinese delegate said no, and I watched, aghast, as Merkel threw
up her hands in despair and conceded the point. Now we know why — because China bet, correctly, that Obama would
get the blame for the Copenhagen accord's lack of ambition.
China, backed at times by India, then proceeded to take out all the numbers that mattered. A 2020 peaking year in global
emissions, essential to restrain temperatures to 2C, was removed and replaced by woolly language suggesting that
emissions should peak ""as soon as possible"". The long-term target, of global 50% cuts by 2050, was also excised. No one
else, perhaps with the exceptions of India and Saudi Arabia, wanted this to happen. I am certain that had the Chinese not
been in the room, we would have left Copenhagen with a deal that had environmentalists popping champagne corks
popping in every corner of the world.
Strong position
So how did China manage to pull off this coup? First, it was in an extremely strong negotiating position. China didn't need
a deal. As one developing country foreign minister said to me: ""The Athenians had nothing to offer to the Spartans."" On
the other hand, western leaders in particular — but also presidents Lula of Brazil, Zuma of South Africa, Calderon of
Mexico and many others — were desperate for a positive outcome. Obama needed a strong deal perhaps more than
anyone. The US had confirmed the offer of $100bn to developing countries for adaptation, put serious cuts on the table for
the first time (17% below 2005 levels by 2020), and was obviously prepared to up its offer.
Above all, Obama needed to be able to demonstrate to the Senate that he could deliver China in any global climate
regulation framework, so conservative senators could not argue that US carbon cuts would further advantage Chinese
industry. With midterm elections looming, Obama and his staff also knew that Copenhagen would be probably their only
opportunity to go to cjinT3t?j..chanQE-3. talks with a strong mandate. This further strengthened China's negotiating hand, as
did the complete lack of civil society political pressure on either China or India. Campaign groups never blame developing
countries for failure; this is an iron rule that is never broken. The Indians, in particular. have become past masters at ca-
opting the language of equity (""equal rights to the atmosphere"") in the service of planetary suicide — and leftish
campaigners and commentators are hoist with their own petard.
With the deal gutted, the heads of state session concluded with a final battle as the Chinese delegate insisted on
removing the 1.5C target so beloved of the small island states and low-lying nations who have most to lose from rising
seas. President Nasheed of the Maldives, supported by Brown, fought valiantly to save this crucial number. ""How can you
ask my country to go extinct?"" demanded Nasheed. The Chinese delegate feigned great offence — and the number
stayed, but surrounded by language which makes it all but meaningless. The deed was done.
China's game
All this raises the question: what is China's game? Why did China, in the words of a UK-based analyst who also spent
hours in heads of state meetings, ""not only reject targets for itself, but also refuse to allow any other country to take on
binding targets?"" The analyst, who has attended climate conferences for more than 15 years, concludes that China wants
to weaken the climate regulation regime now ""in order to avoid the risk that it might be called on to be more ambitious in a
few years' time"".
This does not mean China is not serious about global warming. It is strong in both the wind and solar industries. But
China's growth, and growing global political and economic dominance, is based largely on cheap coal. China knows it is
becoming an uncontested superpower; indeed its newfound muscular confidence was on striking display in Copenhagen.
Its coal-based economy doubles every decade, and its power increases commensurately. Its leadership will not alter this
magic formula unless they absolutely have to.
Copenhagen was much worse than just another bad deal, because it illustrated a profound shift in global geopolitics. This
is fast becoming China's century, yet its leadership has displayed that multilateral environmental governance is not only
not a priority, but is viewed as a hindrance to the new superpower's freedom of action. I left Copenhagen more
despondent than I have felt in a long time. After all the hope and all the hype, the mobilisation of thousands, a wave of
optimism crashed against the rock of global power politics, fell back, and drained away.

Starting at around 3 pm Friday, Adams and McGuinness returned to Hillsborogh to meet with Robinson and Arlene
Foster. The four talked privately for several hours and then asked for the draft papers to review. The discussion
continued until around 1 am when the parties left Hillsborough. (Foster's presence is apparently very helpful. Her
relationship with the SF leaders is much more positive and direct, treating them as equal colleagues.)
Woodward and Irish FM Martin will meet with Adams and Robinson separately this afternoon to assess where the talks
are. The talks last night/early morning ended more positively and if that is still the case there may be a decision to push
on today to see if agreement can be reached. It is equally possible that the two ministers and DUP/SF will decide to
wind up today and resume on Monday.
Brown and Cowen have spoken this morning and will speak again late this afternoon.
The issue is still parades. Robinson needs some certainity of change on parades. It is important for him politically within
the DUP, but also externally since this has become a symbol of whether he has achieved something or compromised too
much. Adams and SF have moved very far from their original positions on parades, adding that Robinson has also
moved.
The DUP linkage of the timeframes for devolution and parades is not Robinson's goal but DUP deputy party leader Nigal
Dodds. Logistically, such a linkage would be impossible without delaying devolution given that the parades framework
requires consultation, legislation, and implementation.

3786,"To rebuild Haiti, start with its young peopleTo rebuild Haiti, start with its young people A 700,000-strong national civic service corps would harness untapped labor
rapidly and instill national pride and confidence.
By Robert Muggah and Robert Maguire
January 31, 2010
Haiti will need big ideas to recover and rebuild in the aftermath of the devastating magnitude 7.0 earthquake this
month. The reported death toll has topped 150,000, and the reconstruction needs are incalculable. How about starting
with a 700,000-strong national civic service corps made up of Haitian youth? There are many reasons why such an entity
makes a lot of sense.
Haiti is a young country. An estimated 70% of the population is under 30; the 15-to-29 segment alone makes up 50% of
the population.
Demographers have long cautioned how excessively youthful populations can potentially exacerbate underdevelopment
and accentuate political instability.
Although Haiti registers among the lowest levels of education in the Western Hemisphere, Haitian youth are a wellspring
of creativity, talent and potential. You don't need to be a community-development specialist to know that they are
stifled by a lack of meaningful opportunities.
Fortunately, Haiti has an enabling environment to set up a civic service corps. Article 52 of the Haitian Constitution
commits citizens to national service, though it has never been activated. What is more, there are many Haitian and
international organizations mobilized and ready to help the government get this going.
A civic service corps would get the young and able out of the tent cities in and around Port-au-Prince and into work.
They could start with the once-iconic center of the capital, but also could begin planting trees, working the fields and
providing services in Haiti's countryside.
At a minimum, this would reverse generations of unfair stigmatizing of the youth there.
This plan would also harness untapped labor rapidly. Before the Jan. 12 earthquake, 50% of youth in their 20s were out
of work. Putting them in service toward rebuilding the capital and outlying areas would be a first step to restoring their
and their country's pride and dignity.
A civic service corps would also multiply international efforts to promote recovery after the world moves on to the next
crisis. Hundreds of humanitarian agencies, donor governments and nongovernmental organizations are facing
monumental challenges in coordinating relief assistance. Although everyone involved is committed to rapid
disbursement, transaction costs are monumental. A civic service corps would allow for a more rapid form of transferring
capital.
Direct support to such a corps would inject serious liquidity into the Haitian economy and stimulate recovery from the
bottom up. Rather than food-for-work schemes, international best practice recommends proposals that promote direct
monetary transfers to beneficiaries. Haitian youth and their families have urgent needs and don't need paternalistic
programs that curb their choices. With proper oversight and financial safeguards, a civic service corps would circumvent
unnecessary administrative costs.
Further, a civic service corps would restore national pride and confidence in Haitian public institutions. During past
decades, the state provided relatively few services to Haitians, particularly outside the capital. In some cases, state
entities were downright predatory. As a result, nonstate providers, including gangs and shady middlemen, filled the gap.
A civic service corps -- wearing the Haitian colors and acting as first responders or organizations demonstrating the
government's presence on the ground -- would show that the government is serious about supporting citizens. It would
be a symbolic first step toward renewing the social contract with the people.
A civic service corps also makes sense for long-term risk and emergency planning. Haiti is situated in the path of
hurricanes and on a fault line, and can expect more disasters. Training 700,000 young people -- especially young women
-- in the basics of first aid, emergency response, community policing and other skills would greatly mitigate the
consequences of future calamities. With disciplined training and management, the corps could provide more intensive
training in specialized areas -- engineering, telecommunications and public health.
An initial step to getting Haiti's youth to work could include the preparation of a road map for future meetings on Haiti,
including the U.N. donor conference scheduled for March. Any final plan would need to draw on the invaluable
experiences of ongoing efforts to mobilize youth in Haiti. These include the work of the Brazilian nongovernmental
organization Viva Rio and its supporters. Before the earthquake, Viva Rio and Brazilian peacekeepers had recruited and
trained hundreds of Haitian youth, including former gang members, to provide relief services in Haiti's slums. This
program could be reactivated and scaled up quickly.
A civic service corps could draw on the lessons from such groups to target and recruit youths for, say, up to two years.
The Haitian government would, of course, need to be the one to manage the undertaking, with direct oversight from the
president's office and the Interior Ministry.
And there are many countries that could provide advice and support.
Nongovernmental groups and private donors could also play a key role in mobilizing support and transferring essential
skills.
Haiti's youth are the future of the nation, and they are central to Haiti's recovery. A civic service corps is a large-scale
way to quickly mobilize them to act as catalyst for long-term, progressive changes.
Robert Muggah, based at the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva, is a principal of
the SecDev Group and is currently advising multilateral and bilateral organizations on Haiti's recovery. Robert Maguire is
on the faculty of Trinity Washington University and chairs the Haiti Working Group of the United States Institute of
Peace in Washington.

Current Under Secretary Rajiv Shah
Rajiv ""Raj"" Shah (born March 9, 1973) is presently Under Secretary of Agriculture for Research, Education,
and Economics (REE) and Chief Scientist at the United States Department of Agriculture.
Prior to his appointment at USDA, Shah worked in a range of leadership roles at the Bill & Melinda Gates
Foundation including Director of Agricultural Development, Director of Financial Services, leader of the
Strategic Opportunities initiative and manager of the Foundation's $1.5 billion commitment to the Vaccine
Fund. He also came up with the idea for the International Finance Facility for Immunization to transform the
global system of vaccine financing, and worked to secure donor commitments of more than $5 billion for this
facility. Before joining the Gates Foundation, Shah was a health care policy advisor on the Al Gore presidential
campaign, 2000 and a member of Governor Ed Rendell's (D-PA) transition committee on health.
Shah earned his M.D. from the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine and M.Sc. in Health Economics
at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. He is a graduate of the University of Michigan and
also attended the London School of Economics.
President Obama announced Shah's selection as Under Secretary of Research, Education, and Economics and
Chief Scientist on April 17, 2009. Shah's nomination was confirmed by the United States Senate by unanimous
consent on May 12, 2009.
Early life and family
Born to Indian immigrant parents who settled in Ann Arbor, Michigan in the late 60's, Raj Shah grew up in the
Detroit area and attended Wylie Groves High School.
He lives with his wife, Shivam, and their two young children, Sajan and Amna. He has one sister, Ami Shah,
who is a medical doctor.
Career
Raj Shah is currently the Under Secretary of Research, Education and Economics (REE) and Chief Scientist at
the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The REE mission area provides the science that federal agencies, policy
makers, researchers, and others draw on to meet challenges facing America's food and agriculture system. The
four REE agencies are the Agricultural Research Service (including the National Agricultural Library), the
Economic Research Service, the National Agricultural Statistics Service, and the Cooperative State Research,
Education and Extension Service.
Prior to his appointment at USDA Raj worked in a range of leadership roles at the Bill & Melinda Gates
Foundation to help the poorest people on earth lead healthy and productive lives.
As the Director of the Agricultural Development program, Shah oversaw the foundation's multi-billion dollar
portfolio of grant and program-related investments to help transform rural economies throughout the developing
world and help small farmers and their families overcome hunger and poverty. He led efforts to create the
Alliancefor a Green Revolution in Africa, helped recruit its leadership including UN Secretary General Kofi
Annan, and serves on its Board of Directors. He oversaw grant portfolios in science and technology; farmer
productivity; market access; and policy, statistics and advocacy; and managed a team of more than 60
professionals. He also developed innovative partnerships with private industry, the United Nations, the World
Bank, and country governments around the world, where he was an active voice on issues related to food and
hunger.
As the Foundation's first Director for the Financial Services to the Poor portfolio, Shah worked with a broad
range of financial institutions and other donors to determine how Foundation resources could best amplify the
field's collective impact. Previously, he led the Strategic Opportunities initiative which worked with Foundation
co-chairs to identify, assess and recommend new areas of giving. This process led to the creation of the
Foundation's Global Development Program.
Shah's early work with the Foundation focused on global health. As Deputy Director for Policy and Finance,
Raj managed the Foundation's $1.5 billion commitment to the Vaccine Fund — an effort referred to by Bill and
Melinda Gates as their best investment. He also came up with the idea for the International Finance Facility for
Immunization to transform the global system of vaccine financing and worked to secure donor commitments of
more than $5 billion for this facility. The World Health Organization estimates this initiative will save more
than five million children's lives through the next decade, and a New York Times article described the effort as
""a clever way to reduce the burden of costly diseases now and save money in the future.""
Shah previously worked as a health care policy advisor on the Gore 2000 presidential campaign, was an active
supporter of the Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2008, and served as a member of Pennsylvania Governor
Ed Rendell's health transition committee. He also co-founded Health Systems Analytics (a health care
consulting firm), served as an advisor to the City of Philadelphia's Public Health Commissioner, and worked at
the World Health Organization. In addition, he co-founded multiple nonprofit organizations focused on
increasing the political awareness and civic engagement of minority communities, including Project Impact for
South Asian Americans.","['United', 'States', 'United', 'States', 'Michigan', 'Detroit', 'America', 'Africa', 'Pennsylvania', 'Philadelphia']"

unaided. Soo°, someone(s) at the NSC briefed him so that the message would be delivered to the ""other team"" that their
behavior is being watched closely and that the NSC team is prepared to use the public media as a weapon if need be.
The reporter then went to the Defense Department where he was told their side of the story. Secretary Gates appears to
have become the leader of the pentagon faction

Civilian, military planners have different views on new
approach to Afghanistan
By Rajiv Chandrasekaran
Washington Post Staff Writer
Saturday, December 26, 2009; A01
Two days before announcing the deployment of additional U.S. troops to 8fg,rianistan, President Obama informed Gen.
Stanley A. McChrystal that he was not granting McChrystal's request to double the size of the Afghan army and police.
Cost was a factor, as were questions about whether the capacity exists to train 400,000 personnel. The president told
McChrystal, the top commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan, to focus for now on fielding a little more than
half that number by next October.
Ten days after Obama's speech, the U.S. command responsible for training the Afghans circulated a chart detailing the
combined personnel targets for the army and police. McChrystal's goal of 400,000 remained unchanged.
""It's an open issue,"" a senior Pentagon official said last week.
Nearly a month after Obama unveiled his revised Afghanistan strategy, military and civilian leaders have come away with
differing views of several fundamental aspects of the president's new approach, according to more than a dozen senior
administration and military officials involved in Afghanistan policy, all of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to
discuss internal deliberations.
Members of Obama's war cabinet disagree over the meaning of his pledge to begin drawing down forces in July 2011 and
whether the mission has been narrowed from a proposal advanced by McChrystal in his August assessment of the war.
The disagreements have opened a fault line between a desire for an early exit among several senior officials at the White
House and a conviction among military commanders that victory is still achievable on their terms.
The differences are complicating implementation of the new strategy. Some officers have responded to the July 2011 date
by seeking to accelerate the pace of operations, instead of narrowing them. At the White House, a senior administration
official said, the National Security Council is discussing ways to increase monitoring of military and State Department
activities in Afghanistan to prevent ""overreaching.""
The NSC's strategic guidance, a classified document that outlines the president's new approach, was described by the
senior administration official as limiting military operations ""in scale and scope to the minimum required to achieve two
goals -- to prevent ai-Qaeda safe havens and to prevent the Taliban from toppling the government."" The use of resource-
intensive counterinsurgency tactics -- employing U.S. forces to protect Afghan civilians from the Taliban -- is supposed to
be restricted to key cities and towns in southern and eastern parts of the country, the official said.
""The strategy has fundamentally changed. This is not a COIN strategy,"" Vice President Biden said on MSNBC last week,
using the military's shorthand for counterinsurgency. ""This is not 'go out and occupy the whole country.' ""
Setting limits
During a videoconference two days before the speech, Obama made it clear to McChristal and U.S. Ambassador Karl W.
Eikenberry that he did not want the additional troops to fuel a broader mission. Speaking to both men from the White
House Situation Room, the president told them not to deploy the forces to areas they would not be able to transfer to
Afghan security forces by July 2011, according to two senior officials with knowledge of the conversation.
Obama's essential instruction was, according to one of the officials, ""Don't bite off more than you can chew.""
White House officials said the president opposes using the forces he has authorized to duplicate an expansive, iraq-style
counterinsurgency operation -- in part because he questions whether it will be possible to achieve a similar outcome in
Afghanistan, which is less developed, and because he wants to start reducing troops in 18 months. The White House's
desired end state in Afghanistan, officials said, envisions more informal local security arrangements than in Iraq, a less-
capable national government and a greater tolerance of insurgent violence.
Senior military officials still think they can achieve a better outcome than envisaged by civilian skeptics in the
administration by using the new forces to mount more comprehensive counterinsurgency operations. Although Pentagon
strategists and McChrystal's advisers in Kabul are looking at how they can fulfill the White House desire for a less
extensive mission, military officials said they are reluctant to strip too much away and weaken an approach that has come
to be revered within the ranks as the only way to suppress guerrilla movements.
Military officials contend that McChrystal does not harbor expansionist aims. They note that he has begun removing
troops from remote mountain valleys and concentrating resources on a modest number of key population centers. But the
approach in those areas will involve counterinsurgency tactics: Troops will focus on restoring normal patterns of life by
trying to keep the Taliban at bay, helping the Afghan government provide basic services to the population and training
local security forces.
McChrystal's plan, the senior Pentagon official said, ""is still counterinsurgency, regardless of the various agendas people
are trying to spin.""
Dissent over drawdown
During strategy discussions at the White House, differences between the White House and the military came into sharp
relief over °baffle's decision to announce his intention to begin drawing down troops in July 2011.
McChrystal argued against it, according to three officials familiar with the process. The head of the U.S. Central
Command, Gen. David H. Petraeus, also expressed concerns. Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates urged Obama to
make the drawdoWn ""conditions-based.""
""There was a lot of push back"" from the Defense Department, one of the officials said.
The president received cover from one uniformed general at the table, James E. Cartwright, the vice chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff. Cartwright had adopted a more skeptical view of the mission than many of his military colleagues, one that
resonated with Obama and Biden.
Cartwright effectively endorsed the July 2011 date, arguing that increasing forces and engaging in limited
counterinsurgency made sense, the senior administration official said, ""but given the risk factors -- Pakistan, the Karzai
government, the whole notion of sub-national governance and our track record with the [Afghan security forces], which is
not prestigious -- that it made sense to demonstrate that we could actually do this.""
It. also helped Obama that the principal troop-increase proposal being discussed at the time -- a recommendation that
McChrystal receive 30,000 forces for 18 to 24 months -- had been developed by Gates. The Defense Department
paperwork detailing the proposal identified the increase as starting in the summer of 2009, when the first troops deployed
by the president this year began conducting operations in Afghanistan, but it did not specify an end date.
""Rather than leaving this indefinite and hypothetical, the president's intervention was to say, 'Okay, if we're starting in July
of '09, then we're really talking about July of '11,"" said the senior administration official who described the NSC guidance.
Obama eventually told his war cabinet that he would announce the July 2011 deadline but that the pace of withdrawals
would be determined, as Gates had sought, by conditions on the ground. Obama said he would conduct a thorough
review of progress in a year's time. Although he did not endorse McChrystal's request to increase the Afghan security
forces to 400,000, he said he would reevaluate the issue once the 2010 goal of training 230,000 forces is achieved.
The president avoided details in his Dec. 1 address, leaving it up to members of his Cabinet and to his advisers to explain
the specifics. The result has been a wide divergence of expectations. Gates, appearing on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" the
Sunday after the speech, said that perhaps only ""some handful or some small number"" would be withdrawn. Biden, during
his MSNBC appearance last week, said a chart showing an increase in U.S. deployments this year would be ""coming
down as rapidly over the next two years.""
The ambiguity over the meaning of the July 2011 deadline has generated uncertainty over the presidents intent. ""Is the
surge a way of helping us leave more quickly, or is the timeline a way to help win support for the surge?"" asked a senior
Democratic staff member in Congress. ""Which is the strategy and which is the head-fake? Nobody knows.""
One senior military officer in Afghanistan said he and his fellow soldiers ""don't know if this is all over in 18 months, or
whether this is just a progress report that leads to minor changes.""
""Until they tell us otherwise,"" the officer said, ""we're operating as if the latter is the policy.""
A 'dramatic change'?
Although senior-level civilians in the administration emerged from the review process thinking the mission had been
circumscribed, senior military officials continue to have a different view. The result, as they see it, is that the White House
has embraced McChrystal's original plan.
""We had already been pretty focused that we wouldn't try to clear and hold things more than we needed to,"" said a senior
commander involved in the war. ""It wasn't a dramatic change by any means.""
White House officials have cited a meeting among NSC staff members and McChrystal in which the general displayed a
slide stating that his mission was to ""Defeat the Taliban,"" which some civilians deemed overly ambitious because it
suggested that every last member of the Taliban would have to be killed or captured. The officials said the mission was
redefined to avoid the term.
But to military officers, defeat ""doesn't mean wipe everyone out,"" the commander said. ""It means after Waterloo,
Napoleon still had an army but he wasn't going to threaten Europe. We used that view when we worked defeat.""
Even before the White House review had finished, the commander in charge of day-to-day operations, Lt. Gen. David M.
Rodriguez, had developed a plan to concentrate U.S. and NATO efforts in 80 of the country's nearly 400 districts.
""They're taking credit for some of the things that McChrystal was already doing and calling it a narrowed focus,"" a senior
military official said.
White House advisers maintain that the review process did refine the mission beyond what McChrystal had proposed over
the summer.
""There was a real narrowing here,"" the senior administration official said. ""Stan has a big leadership task to adapt his
original concept to the new strategic guidance.""
The official said NSC officials recognize it will take time for the new orders to filter through the ranks. ""This doesn't turn
around with a speech,"" the official said. ""But I hope we don't see slides a month from now that continue to state that our
goal is 400,000"" Afghan security forces.
The challenge, said that official and another senior administration official, is to recalibrate military operations over the next
18 months in accordance with the new goal.
""The guidance they have is that we're not doing everything, and we're not doing it forever,"" the second official said. ""The
hardest intellectual exercise will be settling on how much is enough.""
For now, however, top military officers speak more expansively than White House advisers.
""Winning means we hand off to a security force that can secure the country,"" the senior Pentagon official said. ""We've
separated the enemy, we've connected the people to the government, and we're helping them to rebuild their economy.
It's at that point that we begin to transition it over to them.""
Terms such as ""winning"" and ""victory"" have been eschewed by the White House. Obama did not use either in his Dec. 1
address, and he said in an interview earlier this year that he was uncomfortable using the term ""victory"" when fighting ""a
non-state actor, a shadowy operation like al-Qaeda.""
But when Gates visited Kabul a week after Obama's speech, he made a point of telling military personnel there that ""we
are in this thing to win.""
""From a moral perspective, when you ask soldiers and families to sacrifice, we do that to win,"" the Pentagon official said.
""We need to be able to articulate winning.""","['U.S.', 'Afahanistan', 'Pali', 'Afghanistan', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'Afghanistan', 'U.S.', 'Afghanistan', 'Afghanistan', 'Afghanistan', 'U.S.', 'U.S', 'White', 'House', 'Situation', 'Room', 'Afghanistan', 'Afghanistan', 'Iraq', 'Kabul', 'White', 'House', 'Pakistan', 'Afghanistan', 'U.S.', 'Afghanistan', 'Waterloo', 'Europe', 'U.S.', 'Kabul']"

By: David Rogers
February 2,2010 10:43 AM EST
Pennsylvania Rep. John Murtha was back in the hospital Tuesday after undergoing gall bladder
surgery last week.
The Virginia Hospital Center in Arlington said that the 77-year-old Democrat was a patient in its
intensive care unit but referred all questions about his condition to his family.
Murtha's congressional office confirmed that he underwent scheduled laparoscopic surgery to remove
his gallbladder at Bethesda Naval Hospital last week. But the congressman's spokesman refused
comment on the seriousness of his condition or any complication that required hospitalization.
A powerhouse in the House Appropriations Committee and close friend of Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-
Calif.), Murtha was hospitalized for a period in December as well when he suffered an infection in his
gall bladder.
The doctors then decided that it should be removed once the infection had been tempered, and that
set up the surgery last week at Bethesda.
In the interim, Murtha has been back in the Capitol, and in his style, came back from the hospital—
with IV bandages still on him— to oversee passage of his defense appropriations bill.","['Pennsylvania', 'Arlington', 'Bethesda', 'Naval', 'Hospital', 'Bethesda', 'Capitol']"

3897,"Philippe and Jake asked me to send along this response to the Washington Post editorial:
By Michael Posner
The Post's Dec. 27 editorial (""Redefining Human Rights"") on the Obama Administration's human rights and
democracy policies, and Secretary Clinton's recent speech at Georgetown in particular, misses the critical point:
human rights, democracy, and development are mutually reinforcing, not competing goals. They complement
each other in the task of making human rights a human reality.
President Roosevelt understood the fundamental link between liberty, prosperity and security, tying together
freedom of speech and worship with freedom from want and freedom from fear in his famous ""Four Freedoms""
speech. At Georgetown, Secretary Clinton articulated a 21st century vision grounded in this wisdom.
To accuse Secretary Clinton of embracing a Soviet-bloc approach to human rights because she includes
development in a discussion of democracy not only strains the bonds of credulity and common sense, it also
walls off a crucial avenue for ensuring that people can actually exercise the rights that are naturally theirs -
including the rights to freedom of religion, association, and speech-in their daily lives.
As Secretary Clinton made clear, policies that address development alone are not adequate: ""Freedom doesn't
come in half measures, and partial remedies will not solve the whole problem,"" she said. But experience shows
us that where broad-based development occurs, people are more likely to demand a say in securing their futures,
and governments are more likely to have the resources to maintain the strong institutions, including reliable
police and fair courts, that help ensure the consistent protection of rights. Where people are given the right to
speak freely, to participate in their nation's political process and have access to basic information about
government, sustainable development is more likely to occur. At the same time, democracies without
development do not last. These are mutually reinforcing tracks, and the Obama Administration is committed to
pursuing both simultaneously.
As President Obama said in his Nobel lecture, ""engagement with repressive regimes lacks the satisfying purity
of indignation."" But the Post's overheated outrage ignores the lessons learned by generations of men and women
who worked to advance human rights around the world.
To suggest that Secretary Clinton somehow provided excuses to rights-abusing dictators in a speech in which
she forcefully criticized specific abuses across the world, is simply not credible. Far from being an excuse for
any regime, this is an approach that pushes governments to do more to advance civil and political rights and to
ensure that democracy actually delivers a measure of prosperity and opportunity for all. That is the right
approach for the Obama Administration and for the 21st century.

Statement by the Secretary
This Administration has, from the beginning, worked to bring about comprehensive peace in the Middle East, including a
two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. On that issue our approach has been three-fold: (1) to help build the
economy and capacity to govern of a Palestinian state; (2) to renew political negotiations to enable the earliest possible
establishment of that state; and (3) to achieve these in a manner that ensures the security of Israel and of the
Palestinians.
Consistent with Prime Minister Fayyad's plan for a future Palestinian state, Tony Blair, as the Quartet representative, will
intensify his partnership with Senator Mitchell in support of the political negotiations. In his role as Quartet
Representative Tony Blair will continue, with full support by and coordination with Senator Mitchell, to mobilize the
efforts of the international community: (1) to build support for the institutional capacity and governance of a future
Palestinian State, including on the rule of law; (2) to improve freedom of movement and access for Palestinians; (3) to
encourage further private sector investment; and (4) to bring change in the living conditions of the people in Gaza.","['Middle', 'East', 'Israel', 'Gaza']"

According to Craig, Pinera had made the calculation that it would be politically untenable to dump Insulza. Apparently
there is a coalition leadership in the lower house, and Insulza's party, Concertacion, controls the upper house. So he had
no choice.
That said, Craig believes that his clear message had an impact on what Pinera told Insulza. He apparently gave his
support with two conditions: (1) don't interfere in Chilean politics, and (2) take the democratization agenda seriously
and don't carry the ALBA countries' water.
Craig also said that Arturo had been effective in making clear that the jury was out on Insulza in Washington -- that had
an impact on the Pinera government and reinforced their second message to him.

Successfully Engaging Global Media
About the U.S. Role and International Cooperation in Haiti
Examples of Post Efforts to Date
EUROPE
• Reinforcing the Secretary's message, U.S. Ambassador to France Rivkin engaged directly
with over 100 journalists in an event streamed live on-line by CNN, where he highlighted
U.S. assistance to Haiti and the cooperation of the US with France, the UN and the
international community. Embassy Paris also reached out to senior officials in the Elysee,
MFA, French media and civil society at all levels to underscore the message of positive
coordination with our French partners and to set the record straight on the work of the USG
in Haiti. As a result, leading French officials dismissed rumors of rising diplomatic tensions
between the two countries. Leading officials consistently praised the work of the Obama
administration in Haiti and the need for a strong US role in the emergency response.
• Embassy London's media blitz featured Ambassador Susman, who underlined the U.S.
commitment to Haiti at an Embassy Martin Luther King Jr. holiday event with actor James
Earl Jones; the event was covered by BBC World News (audience 270 million worldwide)
and various U.K. papers. The Ambassador and the JO also spoke about Haiti on January 20-
22 on BBC TV 2's ""Daily Politics Show,"" BBC Radio, the BBC TV Evening News, and
other media and helped embed an ITV journalist on the USNS Comfort to help balance ITV's
previously negative reporting and reached out personally to BBC producers to call attention
to inaccurate reporting alleging that the U.S. military prevented Medicins Sans Frontiers
from delivering aid and supplies to the airport in Port Au Prince.
• With media coverage growing more critical, U.S. Ambassador to Greece Speckhard gave an
interview to Ta Nea newspaper and DCM Deborah McCarthy, who previously served in
Haiti, was interviewed by Real Sunday newspaper, resulting in positive stories about U.S.
assistance to Haiti. Meanwhile, the PAO spoke with the Director of Elefterotypia, whose
paper has run some of the most misdirected coverage of Haiti, and received a commitment to
run an Embassy-produced story to counteract the misinformation.
AFRICA
• Four African posts — Senegal, Ghana, Nigeria and Tanzania — organized highly successful
outreach programs based on the diversion of the USS Gunston Hall to Haiti. The ship, with
African officers aboard, was headed to western Africa under AFRICOM' s African
Partnership Station maritime security training program when it was diverted to provide relief
to Haiti. With African officers working alongside U.S. military officers to deliver assistance
to Haitians, PAOs at those posts connected local reporters with the ship to conduct live
interviews of the Africans for their home media, resulting in excellent media placement in all
four countries.
• On January 20 U.S. Ambassador to South Africa Gips gave a 10-minute live interview on
Haiti with 5FM, a leading youth station with listenership of approx 800,000. The
Ambassador highlighted the depth and breadth of US support and congratulated South Africa
for sending emergency teams. The radio hosts told the Embassy afterward that e-mails and
SMS messages were pouring into the station in support of U.S. efforts. Ambassador Gips
reached out to additional audiences via broadcast media on January 21 and recorded a
program via the Africa Regional Media Hub with SABC-International TV's ""Rendezvous
Africa"" program (broadcast across the continent) and live interviews with drive-time radio
programs on two national stations.
• As a result of a press conference hosted by the Embassy on January 22, all major Angolan
media gave positive coverage to U.S. efforts in Haiti, including Radio Nacional de Angola
and the Jornal de Angola newspaper, which ran an editorial January 23 that stated: ""We need
to believe and let those on the ground do their work because the old tactics of criticizing who
is doing something for the Haitian People just for the sake of criticizing at a moment like this
is not acceptable. . . Just see the numbers of daily flights that arrive in Haiti to have an idea
and quickly come to the conclusion that the possible failures and omissions do not supersede
the positive and timely work done by the entities undertaking the relief efforts in Haiti.""
EAST ASIA-PACIFIC
• The U.S. Ambassador to Indonesia's January 21 byliner on Haiti ran as the lead item on the
editorial page of Sep utar Indonesia daily, and it was subsequently picked up by Antara, the
Indonesian national news agency, and subsequently appeared in most Indonesian media.
• South Korea: Looking to help Korean audiences connect with the situation in Haiti, PA
Seoul arranged a Digital Video Conference with the U.S. Consul in Nagoya, Japan, who had
previously served as Information Officer in Port-au-Prince and was a fluent Korean
speaker. CG Kwak underlined the long tradition of US humanitarian assistance to Haiti as
well as the massive US response to the current crisis and noted Korea's own active
involvement in the relief work. The U.S. Ambassador's blog on January 22, dedicated to the
earthquake and those affected by it, received more than 1,500 hits in three days, with almost
all comments supporting U.S. concerns.
The EAP Regional Media Hub in Tokyo hosted a journalists' roundtable with Gordon Duguid
in Haiti on January 25 that included journalists from Hong Kong's Ming Pao newspaper,
Malaysia's New Straits Times newspaper, BERNAM.A (Malaysian National News Agency),
and Australia's Canberra Times newspaper and Radio 6PR (Perth), and resulted in favorable
stories appearing over the next few days in all participating media.
NEAR EAST
• Lebanon: Television station Al-Jadid is not Hezbollah-affiliated, with most of its funding
coming from the Gulf and Libya. Their coverage is also routinely sensationalistic and
mirrored Al-Manar's coverage. PAS Beirut clarified aspects of USG assistance in Haiti to
Al-Jadid on January 20. On Saturday January 23, Al-Jadid hosted the PAO for 30 minutes
on morning news talk-show al-Hadath to discuss American relief efforts in Haiti. The PAO
was able to address many of the accusations carried in the Al-Manar report, including the
myriad ""weapons testing"" myths being propagated by Russian and Venezuelan media outlets.
[Post cannot engage directly with Hezbollah television station Al-Manar as it was designated
as a Special Designated Global Terrorist organization in 2006 under E.O. 13224]
• Morocco: On 1/28/10 the nationalist French-language daily L 'Opinion published an op-ed
entitled, ""Haiti: After terror, the dread..."" The paper is generally considered to be fairly
hostile to the USG, however, on 1/29/10, PAO Rabat and an FSN went to L 'Opinion to
discuss the op-ed. Post was amazed to find the staff, including the writer himself,
accommodating and even apologetic during the meeting. The editor-in-chief immediately
agreed that the piece had been unfair, and the writer somewhat sheepishly explained himself
by saying that public opinion had not quite recovered from ""the Bush years,"" but readily
acknowledged as well that the article was not balanced. PAO gave the writer a dossier of
Washington File articles and some information from Infocentral's regular updates, which he
promised to use in writing a counterpoint article. On 2/1/10, L 'Opinion published an article
entitled, ""The massive humanitarian action of the United States,"" based on the articles
provided by Post. The excellent article underscored the scope of American assistance, both
government and private sector, to aide Haiti's earthquake victims.
• Syria: Syrian state-run media coverage of the USG role in Haiti relief efforts has been
largely negative and inaccurate, portraying the U.S. military as occupying Haiti. Examples
include the Ba'ath party's Al-Baath newspaper publishing three critical articles (1/21/01)
under the headlines: ""US Crimes in Haiti,"" ""US Military Forces Tighten Grip on Haiti,"" and
""US Forces Stop Humanitarian Planes from Landing."" On 1/25/10, government-owned
Tishreen published an op-ed claiming that the superpowers were rushing towards a military
conquest of Haiti in order to profit from reconstruction operations, which is the new method
of colonialism. On 1/28/10, DAS Maura Connelly met with Syrian Ambassador Mustafa,
who promised to work to halt the negative coverage coming from some Syrian outlets. To
encourage more balanced coverage, Embassy Damascus will host a roundtable 2/3/10 with
-
journalists from government-owned and independent Syrian media. Post also extended a
personal invitation to an advisor of the Minister of Information.","['Haiti', 'US', 'LA', 'U.S.', 'EUROPE', 'U.S', 'France', 'U.S.', 'Haiti', 'US', 'France', 'Paris', 'Elysee', 'Haiti', 'Haiti', 'US', 'London', 'U.S.', 'Haiti', 'U.K.', 'Haiti', 'U.S.', 'Port', 'Au', 'Prince', 'U.S', 'Greece', 'Haiti', 'U.S.', 'Haiti', 'Haiti', 'Senegal', 'Ghana', 'Nigeria', 'Tanzania', 'USS', 'Gunston', 'Hall', 'Haiti', 'Africa', 'Haiti', 'U.S.', 'U.S', 'South', 'Africa', 'Haiti', 'US', 'South', 'Africa', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'Haiti', 'Haiti', 'Haiti', 'U.S', 'Indonesia', 'Haiti', 'Indonesia', 'Antara', 'South', 'Korea', 'Haiti', 'PA', 'Seoul', 'U.S.', 'Nagoya', 'Japan', 'Port-au-Prince', 'US', 'Haiti', 'US', 'Korea', 'U.S', 'U.S.', 'Tokyo', 'Haiti', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'Malaysia', 'Australia', 'Lebanon', 'Libya', 'Beirut', 'USG', 'Haiti', 'Al-Jadid', 'Haiti', 'E.O', 'Morocco', 'United', 'States', 'Haiti', 'Syria', 'Haiti', 'U.S.', 'Haiti', 'Haiti', 'Haiti', 'Haiti', 'Damascus']"

The New Public Diplomacy
Joseph S. Nye
2010-02-10
CAMBRIDGE — The world of traditional power politics was typically about whose military or economy would
win. In today's information age, politics is also about whose ""story"" wins.
National narratives are, indeed, a type of currency. Governments compete with each other and with other
organizations to enhance their own credibility and weaken that of their opponents. Witness the contest between
the government and protesters after the Iranian elections in June 2009, in which the Internet and Twitter played
crucial roles, or the recent controversy between Google and China.
Reputation has always mattered in world politics, but credibility has become crucial because of a ""paradox of
plenty."" When information is plentiful, the scarce resource is attention. Under the new conditions, a soft sell
may, more than ever, prove more effective than a hard sell.
For example, the relative independence of the BBC, sometimes a source of consternation to British
governments, has paid rich dividends in credibility, as illustrated by this account of Tanzanian President Jakaya
Kikwete's day: ""he rises at dawn, listens to the BBC World Service, then scans the Tanzanian press.""
Skeptics who treat the term ""public diplomacy"" as a mere euphemism for propaganda miss the point. Simple
propaganda is counterproductive as public diplomacy. Nor is public diplomacy merely a public-relations
campaign. Public diplomacy also involves building long-term relationships that create an enabling environment
for government policies.
The contribution of direct government information to long-term cultural relationships varies with three
dimensions or stages of public diplomacy, and all three are important. The first and most immediate dimension
is daily communications, which involves explaining the context of domestic and foreign-policy decisions. This
dimension also involves preparation for dealing with crises. If there is a vacuum in information after an event,
others will rush in to fill it.
The second dimension is strategic communication, which develops a set of simple themes, much as a political
or advertising campaign does. While the first dimension is measured in hours and days, the second occurs over
weeks, months, and even years.
The third dimension of public diplomacy is the development of lasting relationships with key individuals over
many years or even decades, through scholarships, exchanges, training, seminars, conferences, and access to
media channels. These programs develop what the American journalist Edward R. Murrow once called the
crucial ""last three feet"" — face-to-face communications, with the enhanced credibility that reciprocity creates.
But even the best advertising cannot sell an unpopular product. A communications strategy cannot work if it
cuts against the grain of policy. Actions speak louder than words. All too often, policymakers treat public
diplomacy as a bandage that can be applied after damage is done by other instruments. For example, China tried
to enhance its soft power by successfully staging the 2008 Olympics, but its domestic simultaneous crackdown
in Tibet — and subsequent repression in Xinxiang and arrests of human rights lawyers — undercut its gains.
Great powers try to use culture and narrative to create soft power that promotes their advantage, but they do not
always understand how to do it. Critics in the United States complain that the over-militarization of foreign
policy undercuts its credibility. Instead, they advocate diplomacy ""on steroids,"" staffed by diplomats trained in
new media, cross-cultural communications, granular local knowledge, and networks of contacts with under-
represented groups.
The centralized mass-media approach to public diplomacy still plays an important role. Governments need to
correct daily misrepresentations of their policies, as well as to try to convey a longer-term strategic message.
The main strength of the mass-media approach is its audience reach and ability to generate public awareness
and set the agenda. But its weakness is its inability to influence how the message is perceived in different
cultural settings. The sender knows what she says, but not always what the targets hear. Cultural barriers are apt
to distort what is heard.
Networked communications, on the other hand, can take advantage of two-way communications and peer-to-
peer relations to overcome cultural differences. This type of decentralization and flexibility is difficult for
governments to accomplish, given their central accountability structures.
The greater flexibility of non-governmental organizations in using networks has given rise to what some call
""the new public diplomacy,"" which is no longer confined to messaging, promotion campaigns, or even direct
governmental contacts with foreign publics serving foreign-policy purposes. It is also about building
relationships with civil-society actors in other countries and facilitating networks between non-governmental
parties at home and abroad.
In this approach to public diplomacy, government policy is aimed at promoting and participating in, rather than
controlling, such cross-border networks. Indeed, too much government control, or even the appearance of it, can
undercut the credibility that such networks are designed to engender. The evolution of public diplomacy from
one-way communications to a two-way dialogue treats publics as co-creators of meaning and communication.
Power in a global information age, more than ever, will include a soft dimension of attraction as well as the hard
dimensions of coercion and payment. Combining these dimensions effectively is called ""smart power."" For
-
example, the current struggle against transnational terrorism is a struggle over winning hearts and minds, and
over-reliance on hard power alone is not the path to success.
Public diplomacy is an important tool in the arsenal of smart power, but smart public diplomacy requires an
understanding of credibility, self-criticism, and the role of civil society in generating soft power. If it
degenerates into propaganda, public diplomacy not only fails to convince, but can undercut soft power. Instead,
it must remain a two-way process, because soft power depends, first and foremost, upon understanding the
minds of others.","['China', 'China', 'Tibet', 'United', 'States']"

More than a million spectators gathered before the Capitol on a frosty January afternoon to witness the inauguration of
Barad< Obama, who promised in his campaign to change Washington's mercenary culture of lobbyists, special interest
influence and backroom deals. But within a few months of being sworn in, the President and his top aides were sitting
down with leaders from the pharmaceutical industry to hash out a deal that they thought would make health care reform
possible.
Over the following months, pharmaceutical industry lobbyists and executives met with top White House aides dozens of
times to hammer out a deal that would secure industry support for the administration's health care reform agenda in
exchange for the White House abandoning key elements of the president's promises to reform the pharmaceutical
industry. They flooded Congress with campaign contributions, and hired dozens of former Capitol Hill insiders to push
their case. How they did it--pieced together from news accounts, disclosure forms including lobbying reports and Federal
Election Commission records, White House visitor logs and the sghedu! ..S,:::in. Max,Baucus releases yoiun:tarily--is a
testament to how ingrained the grip of special interests remains in Washington.
In the 2008 campaign, Obama declared his intention to include all stakeholders as he sought to reform the nation's health
care system, but also supported key qemocr.atic health reform uok,
sies. Among these were several that targeted the
pharmaceutical industry: Allowing re-importation of drugs from first world countries with lower drug prices and providing
Medicare with negotiating authority over prescription drug prices in the recently enacted Part D program. These weren't
just promises, Obama had already voted for both of them as a senator in 2007. (Rdl Call Vote 132 and Roll call Vo.t.c.-)
150.)
Set to carry out this agenda were two Capitol Hill veterans, schooled in the monied Washington culture, chief of staff
Rahm Emanuel and deputy chief of staff Jim Messina. Emanuel was a former fundraiser, Clinton administration official,
investment banker and member of the Democratic leadership in Congress. Messina was the former campaign manager
B6
and chief of staff to the powerful Senate Finance Committee chairman Max Baucus. Both were known for their
unparalleled legislative abilities.
Because of Obama's decision to develop a plan operating through the legislative process, members of Congress also
played key roles. Early on, the pharmaceutical companies were told to deal directly with Senate Finance Committee
chairman Max Bpuf.
-4:s. Baucus would be the vehicle for the deal worked out behind the scenes by the White House and
PhRMA.
Central to this effort was PhRMA president, CEO and top lobbyist Billy Tauzin, a longtime Democratic member of
Congress who switched party affiliations after Republicans gained control of Congress in 1994. By switching parties
Tauzin was able to maintain his influence and even rose to be Chairman of the House Committee on Energy &
Commerce. Tauzin became the poster child of Washington's mercenary culture. He crafted a bill to provide prescription
drug access to Medicare recipients, one that provided major concessions to the pharmaceutical industry. Medicare would
not be able to negotiate for lower prescription drug costs and reimportation of drugs from first world countries would not be
allowed. A few months after the bill passed, Tauzin announced that he was retiring from Congress and would be taking a
job helming PhRMA for a salary of $2 million.
Tauzin's job change became fodder for a campaign ad that then presidential candidate Barack Obama ran in the spring of
2008 simply titled "".Biliy."" It featured the candidate, sleeves rolled up, talking to a salon of gasping Americans about the
ways of Washington. ""The pharmaceutical industry wrote into the prescription drug plan that Medicare could not negotiate
with drug companies. And you know what, the chairman of the committee, who pushed the law through, went to work for
the pharmaceutical industry making $2 million a year."" The screen fades to black to inform the viewer that, ""Barack
Obama is the only candidate who refuses Washington lobbyist money,"" while the candidate continues his lecture,
""Imagine that. That's an example of the same old game playing in Washington. You know, I don't want to learn how to
play the game better, I want to put an end to the game playing.""
Aiding PhRMA in their outreach to Congress would be a squadron of lobbyists to push their health care reform priorities.
Over the course of 2009, the drug industry trade group sdeft:tow::!i: _ 520 tniliion on in house and hired lobbyists. Aside from
PhRMA's massive in-house lobbying operation, the trade group hired 48 outside lobbying firms. The total number of
lobbyists working for PhRMA in 2009 reached 165. Some 137 of those 165 lobbyists representing PhRMA were former
employees of either the legislative or executive branches. Of these dozens were former congressional staffers including
two former chiefs of staff to Max Baucus.
According to data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics, drug makers coptr.ibu■ed sums to ....:ongressional
ecii-om.lttee.s during the same period--from January to the end of October (4thquarter numbers are still being
totaled), industry political action committees, employees and their family members flooded lawmakers with over $8 million.
Those contributions tilted heavily to Democrats over Republicans by a 57 to 42 percent margin--the first time in any
election cycle going back to 1990, the first year that the Center for Responsive Politics began tracking industry giving, that
Democrats were so favored. Given their majorities on Capitol Hill, and the new President's intention to reform America's
health care system, the new tilt was perhaps not surprising.
On March 5, the White House a Tee.tiilfa....ivitfi.rnnic!r_nealth care induLd.er.s to try to bring them to the table and
see what could be done to gain their support. In attendance were Billy Tauzin, president, CEO and top lobbyist for
PhRMA, Pfizer CEO Jeff Kindler, America's Health Care Plans (AHIP) Chairman Karen lgnani, Tom Donohue of the
Chamber of Commerce and Robert Wood Johnson Foundations' Rise Lavizzomourey. A day before the White House

administration. In the interview he touted it as an ""optimistic plan"", acknowledging that the industry did have a few
problems but was glad to have a chance to discuss these. Spme were duri?0,7rognnd,,
,td by this apparent change of
heart on behalf of an industry long adverse to health care reforms.
On April 15, Jim Messina and Jon Selib, chief of staff to Senate Finance Committee chairman Max Baucus, convened a
meeting at the headquarters of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) with leaders of organized labor
and health care groups, including PhRMA. At the meeting, the groups decided to form two nonprofit entities to promote
reform efforts, Healthy Economy Now and Americans for Stable Quality Care, that would be almost entftelv funoed pj
.
PhRMA. The two groups spent $24 million on their advertising campaigns; the contract to produce and place ads went to
White House Senior Advisor David AKPD, which owed Axelrod $2 million.
In the next month, CEO's from pharmaceutical companies would meet with Baucus and administration officials at least
four times. These talks preceded a major public event at the White House, one critical to its strategy to promote health
care reform. On May 11, PhRMA and other trade industry groups piedaed cost ,
..-v_itting_measures to the White House that
would save, they claimed, upwards of $2 trillion over the next decade. President Obama announced the deal in the State
Dining Room, flanked by leaders of the various trade groups; the administration followed up with a media blitz in the press
and on the White House Web site.
The next day, Healthy Economy Now's PhRMA funded ad campaign ran their first advertisement in support of the health
care reform process calling for the government to finally ""fix"" the nation's health care cost problems. While many elements
of the $2 trillion cost cutting pledge fell apart, the drug industry remained committed to the process in the hopes that they
could ultimately win out and defeat the provisions they most feared in closed-door meetings with the White House:
The first occurred on June 2. White House visitor logs show PhRMA's top executives, including Tauzin, and industry
CEOs met with Sarah Fenn from the White House Office of Health Care Reform. On the same day, the publicly available
schedule of Senator Max Baucus shows Tauzin and the same industry CEOs met the Senate Finance Committee
chairman. What ultimately resulted from these coordinated meetings would be revealed by Baucus on June 20.
In a press release featuring a statement by Tauzin, Baucus revealed that the pharmaceutical industry had accepted $80
billion in cost cutting measures to be included in the Senate Finance Committee version of the bill. According to news
re_gorts, Baucus initially proposed $100 billion in cost cutting measures, but the executives and lobbyists meeting on June
2 were able to win the lower figure.
The terms of the initial cost-cutting deal included $30 billion go directly towards closing the ""donut hole"" in Medicare
prescription drug coverage. The ""donut hole"" is a term for the gap in coverage that occurs within the Medicare prescription
drug coverage. For those purchasing prescription drugs through the Medicare program coverage cuts off at $2,700 spent
and does not pick back up again until $6,154 is spent by the participant. The amount proposed in the deal; 50 percent
coverage for drugs within the coverage gap, however, would not completely close the ""donut hole.""
In Baucus' press release, Tauzin is quoted as saying, ""This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and, working together, we
can make this hope for a better tomorrow a reality today."" This ""once-in-a-lifetime"" opportunity also extended to the
pharmaceutical industry's ability to blunt the long-term Democratic agenda of lowering prescription drug prices through
Medicare negotiations, re-importation and quicker release of generics onto the market. After making such a grand
statement of support through cost cutting proposals it was time for the pharmaceutical industry to finally force the White
House and Democrats to take certain chips off the table.
Baucus proceeded with a_pia,n c.c)r
.ivene.a bicartisap rimuo in an effort to craft the bill desired by the White House.
These participants included Democrats Kent Conrad and Jeff Bingaman and Republicans Chuck Grassley, Mike Enzi and
Olympia Snowe. Baucus' decision and the need to solidify deals with groups like the pharmaceutical industry - which were
reliant on Baucus producing a bill - slowed down the legislative process making it impossible for Congress to meet the
White House's announced iltuouet reces§ dee&rie for passing health care reform.
Soon after, PhRMA's big guns and industry lobbyists paid the White House another visit on July 7 and this time met with
Rehm Emanuel and Jim Messina (Baucus' chief of staff Jon Selib is also listed in White House visitor logs for this
meeting). In August, The Huffirytorj. !Dosi',.
--; Ryan Grim reported on an internal memo that was drafted at that meeting that
outlined the policies that would not be allowed into any final version of health care reform. These included Medicare
prescription drug negotiations, drug re-importation, and the lowering of prices for drugs available through Medicare Part D
and Part B. The deal would be $80 billion in cost cutting and absolutely no more.
***
While the $80 billion deal was cut with Baucus' committee, other congressional committees continued to mark-up their
own versions of health care reform without the knowledge that the White House was relying on Baucus to produce the
final product. In the House of Representatives, the House Energy & Commerce Committee leveled a direct threat to the
$80 billion deal. Energy & Commerce Chair Henry Waxman sought to include all of the provisions that PhRMA had gotten
the White House and Baucus to cut out of the reform bill. These included drug reimportation. Medicare negotiating power
and speedier release of generics to the market. According to previous analysis of the measures proposed by the
committee, these measures would have totaled hundreds of billions in cost cuts, far exceeding the $80 billion cap agreed
to by the White House, Baucus and PhRMA.
The cost cutting measures passed in the Energy & Commerce bill spooked the board of PhRMA, which included all of the
CEOs involved in the deal-cutting meetings with the White House and Baucus. The board pressured Tauzin to go public
with the deal to ensure that the White House would recognize it and not renege. On August 4, the Los Ancg•3les•Firrief-
,
-
:, in
an exclusive report, featured quotes from Tauzin claiming that a deal between the White House and PhRMA existed and
that, as Tauzin put it, ""The White House blessed it."" Tom Hamburger wrote in the article, ""For his part, Tauzin said he had
not only received the White House pledge to forswear Medicare drug price bargaining, but also a separate promise not to
pursue another proposal Obama supported during the campaign: importing cheaper drugs from Canada or Europe.""
The White House's Jim Messina later confirmed Tauzin's claim, stating, ""The president encouraged this approach ... He
wanted to bring all the parties to the table to discuss health insurance reform.""
Democratic lawmakers were furious. Rep. Raul Grijaiva, chairman of the Progressive Caucus, asked, ""Are industry groups
going to be the ones at the table who get the first big piece of the pie and we just fight over the crust?""
***
On September 7, Baucus' bill made a private circulation on the Hill; pharmaceutical industry cost-cutting did not exceed
$80 billion. Five days later, the New York :limes reported that PhRMA planned to spend up to $150 million in an
advertising blitz in support of Baucus' bill. The Times noted that the ad spending ""...would be a follow-up to the deal that
drug makers struck in June with Mr. Baucus and the White House."" On September 16, Baucus released the full text of his
les.j
.islation to the public. t
The White House, PhRMA and Baucus still had to fight a few battles to keep the deal intact. The key amendment
targeting the PhRMA deal in committee mark-up came from Sen. Bill Nelson from Florida, which has one of the largest
Medicare participant populations in the nation. The pull of constituent needs clearly put Bill Nelson into a position to push
for further cost cutting in Medicare prescription drug pricing. His target: closing the ""donut hole"" completely.
Nelson claimed that his amendment would onerate $106 billion in revenue, or from PhRMA's perspective increase their
cost-cutting to $186 billion. That would be unacceptable to PhRMA, to Baucus, to the White House and to the
pharmaceutical industry who had made the deal. Other Senate Democrats, Tom Carper and Robert Menendez voted with
Republicans and Baucus on the committee to defeat the amendment. It is little surprise the Carper's Delaware is home to
AstraZeneca and Menendez' New Jersey is home to Merck and Bristol-Myers-Squibb, all of which lobbied for the $80
billion cap.
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid introduced the final bill, with the cap in place, on November 19. Debate began on Dec.
3, and with it come one more attempt by members to change the terms of the deal. Senator Byron Dorgan introduced an
amendment that would allow for drug re-importation, but as the date for voting drew near, the Federal Drug Administration
(FDA) released a letter objecting to the proposal that echoed pharmaceutical industry talking points: ""...as currently
written, the resulting structure would be logistically challenging to implement and resource intensive. In addition, there are
significant safety concerns."" Dorgan's amendment was defeated with numerous Democrats previously in support of
reimportation switching to ""no"" votes.
On Christmas Eve, the bill passed the Senate with the PhRMA deal fully intact.
***
New Year's Eve passed with no further action on health care reform. Public opinion regarding the health care reform bill
had been slipping throughout 2009. It reached a fulcrum in the special election to replace the deceased senator Ted
Kennedy in Massachusetts on January 19, 2010. Newly minted senator Scott Brown campaigned that he would be the
senator to provide Republicans with the votes to filibuster the final health care reform bill. Democrats ran for cover.
Despite having the largest majorities of any party since the 1970s, Democrats put the brakes on their agenda, particularly
health care reform.
in the end, the pharmaceutical industry's support for health care reform would be left up in the air. After spending $100
million in advertising in support of legislation that Tauzin and key executives hoped would be a windfall for the
pharmaceutical industry, the legislative process had flat-lined. In February, the board of PhRMA, split over the deal cut by
Tauzin, pushedjauzin to_res

I recently had the opportunity to participate in a small dinner with CENTCOM Commander .
General David Petraeus and his wife Holly. These sorts of discussions are nearly always off the record -- but the fact that
they happened is not off limits.
Petraeus was not in uniform but rather wore what looked to me to be a brand new, perfectly tailored dark suit. I joked to
him that if I Twilt.-
-s
,rgc, that out of two dozen or so times I had seen Petraeus that this was the first time I'd seen him out of
uniform, an ice cold shudder of fear would spread quickly through some political circles in DC.
In August of 2007, I wroteoiece, stating that folks should keep an eye out for the possibility that General Petraeus might
run for President in 2012. In April 2008, Steven Lee Myers wrote a solid New York Times follow up titled ""The
General"" referencing my earlier take.
Recently, legendary newsman Ai:nai4d de 13orchgave resuscitated the topic of an Eisenhoweresque future for the
counterinsurgency guru in his piece, ""President ?etraeus7""
Petraeus was recently named as one of Foreign Policy magazine's tip 100 ttzal thinkers, and as U.S. News & World
Reports ""Washington Whispers"" notes, he is going to be speaking in May 2010 at the annual American Enterprise
Institute dinner receiving the Irving Kristol Award.
In January 2010, Public Policy Pollin.q revealed that while Obama held a ten point lead over a potential wild card race
against Petraeus, the General had some strengths. But the pollsters also noted that many in the American public just
didn't know enough yet about Petraeus to form an opinion:
Finally our blog readers voted for David Petraeus as our wild card Republican this month and his
numbers come out as a mixed bag. He has the largest deficit against Obama, trailing 44-34. But at +13
his net favorability is better than the President or any of the other Republicans we tested. The problem for
him is that the numbers break down 25/12- 63% of voters in the country don't know enough about him to
have formed an opinion. Who knows if Petraeus would actually have any interest in going into politics, but
if he did he would be introducing himself to many voters for the first time.
President Obama himself, according to what some of his aides have reported to me, is quite taken with David Petraeus
and respects his approach and thinking.
Petraeus has also been respectful of the President -- although when pushed at a recent forum about how he might react
to a Presidential decision on Afghanistan that the General might not have liked, Petraeus offered a cryptic rather than
clear response. (see above video)
At the ""First Draft of History"" meeting sponsored by the Atlantic Monthly/Atlantic Media Group, the Newseum, and the
Aspen Institute; Petraeus when asked if he would support the President no matter what the result of the strategic review
on Afghanistan responded that he ""would continue to give the President the best professional military advice he could.""
Contrast that with Defense Secretary Robert Gates resoonOinato_the..saest.ipr
.j., ""We will salute and execute [the
President's] decisions faithfully and to the best of our ability.""
But after spending an evening with General Petraeus and watching him closely for a number of years, there is no way that
this intelligent leader -- with whom I have some disagreements but respect -- could be comfortable with the Tea Party
takeover of the Republican political machine.
There is always the possibility that a core of reasonable Republicans like Michael Bloomberg, James Baker, Olympia
Snowe, Chuck Hegel, Alan Simpson, John Whitehead, Peter Peterson, Rita Hauser and others will try to rekindle classic
Republican sensibilities by fighting to re-hijack their party back in an Eisenhower-like campaign with Petraeus at the lead.
Remember that Eisenhower clinched the Republican nomination by promising to be the President who though he knew
war would end the Korean War. Petraeus knows Afghanistan and Iraq -- and though it seems hard to envision today could
be the kind of leader promising to end those wars if Obama proves unable to do so.
But there is another option that intrigues me and seems more realistic than imagining the iconic David Petraeus running
for President -- and that is his running for Vice President.
I think Vice President Joe Biden has done an outstanding job and of all the big guns in the Obama White House, Biden
has done the best job of outperforming expectations. He had given President Obama much needed counsel, not always
taken regrettably, but counsel that Obama needed to show the American public he was getting. Biden has been the key
agent behind the scenes in moving Iraq's elections forward. He has scored a lot of wins -- not reported -- in the
nuclear/WMD controls arena. Biden has worked with Gates in stabilizing an awkward and complex relationship with
Russia -- and his counterpoints on the Afghanistan surge, in my view, remain compelling.
But Biden is going to have to find a way to hold his spot in 2012 because others are going to be gunning for it.
As I look at it now, Hillary Clinton who has now said that she will not do more than one term as Secretary of State would
be a natural candidate for the Obama VP slot. Her franchise is not completely in the control of the Obama team yet, but
moving Hillary closer to the White House (although her private home on Whitehaven Street is actually a couple of hundred
feet closer to the White House than the VP residence at the Naval Observatory) would finalize Obarna's takeover of all the
key political franchises in the Democratic Party -- starting with Daley's machine, Deschle's machine, Kennedy's machine,
Edwards' machine, and then the Clintons'.
But General David Petraeus, in his business suit, lurks out there. Obama seems to be concerned about looking like he is
weak on national security. The Republicans -- at Cheney's constant goading (and now Sarah Palin's) -- seem to want to
continue to play politics through fear-mongering.
Obama could neutralize the possibility that he faces a Republican party challenge by David Petraeus by inviting the
General on to the 2012 ticket as a Democrat.
Crazy? Perhaps.
But inviting potential rivals into his tent is becoming a standard Obama trademark -- much as he did by appointing
Republican Governor of Utah and former G.W. Bush administration Deputy US Trade Representative Jon Huntsman, Jr.
to serve as US Ambassador to the People's Republic of China.
And get this, we have just learned that David Petraeus has not voted since 2002 -- not because he doesn't care to vote --
but reportedly because he wants to keep his eventual political options and political loyalties open.
This is a soldier for whom all options are on the table and who is keeping his powder dry.
My hunch is that whether Obama sticks with Vice President Biden or pivots to someone else, Petraeus will be on the short
list of those considered.

Supreme Court Justice Jim Johnson, known both for his segregationist political activities in the 1950s and dabbling in
the political campaign against Bill Clinton during his presidency, died yesterday.
A Faulkner County sheriffs office spokesman, Lt. Matt Rice, said Johnson was found dead in his home about 10 a.m.
Saturday with an apparently self-inflicted chest wound from a .30-30 rifle. Johnson had been beset by medical
problems, he said. Roller-McNutt Funeral Home in Conway will be handling arrangements.
He was 85. Here's a standat biographica: hstory. This will end his prolific and pointed letters to the editor (unless some
are still in the pipeline), delivered on stationery marked with his name for his Conway home, ""White Haven.""
Justice Jim was a courtly man and lively company, gracious in social interaction with friend and political foe. But Mark
Anthony's words in Julius Caesar about men's deeds come, unavoidably, to mind. As recently as 1990, he worked in an
effort to preserve state Amendment 44, the states rights amendment aimed at curbing integration that was his brainchild.

I thought your designation of Iran as a near military government was very good. Gary Sick has been arguing that it is in
fact a military government. Of course this is predicate for targeted sanctions. There is a consistent thread in the
challenges we face from a host of authoritarian (and totalitarian) military governments, sometimes loosely allied on an ad
hoc basis--Iran, China, Myanmar, Venezuela, Cuba. This is nothing like the Cold War, but it's an idea worth exploring, not
publicly discussing, but thinking about.
On Justice Jim, a couple of thoughts: I wish his tragic end were as politically conclusive as that of Edmund Ruffin, the
Southern fire-eater and secessionist who was given the honor of firing the first shot at Fort Sumter and upon hearing of
Appomattox carefully sat himself down in his grand Charleston house and blew his brains out with a shotgun.
Unfortunately, the evil Justice Jim did lives on--in the wild bigotry against Obama and even through the Supreme Court
decision in the case of Citizens United, a group he helped galvanize to circulate the Whitewater hoax.

Podesta: W.H. 'lost' health
narrative
By: AH!,
February 15, 2010 03:03 PM
EST
John Podesta, the president of the
Center for American Progress who
led Barack Obama's presidential
transition, acknowledges the White
House has been unable to
successfully drive the debate on
health care reform.
""They lost the narrative,"" Podesta
told the Financial Times. ""They lost
the perspective of how all of the
activity they were engaged in was
knit together.""
In a video interview posted on the
newspaper's website Monday,
Podesta also bemoaned the
present political climate in
Washington and expressed
frustration with inability of the White
House and Congress to advance
the president's agenda.
""Change is hard in America. We've
all learned that over the last year,""
said the former White House chief
of staff under Bill Clinton. ""There is
real frustration amongst
independent voters, and anger
amongst independent voters.""
Voters have become discouraged,
Podesta said, by seeing ""no spirit in
which people were having a
reasonable conversation"" during the
health care debate and from ""the
last twist and turns on health care,
the special deals that had to be
made in the Senate to get the 60
votes.""
Asked how he would rate the health
of the American political system, he
responded simply: ""Sucks.""
""It feels like a very frustrated
country, a country frustrated with
the inability of Washington to do
anything to get the economy going
again, to get jobs going again,"" he
said. ""And I think that there is
tremendous anger [and] frustration
about the inability to improve
people's lives.""
Republicans also have shown little
ability to raise the level of debate,
Podesta suggested.
Obama's ""not dealing with the party
of Lincoln. He's dealing with the
party of Palin,"" Podesta said,
referring to Sarah Palin, the former
Alaska governor who was the 2008

H: FYI: Les Gelb. S
Replace Rahm
by Leslie H. Gelb
February 15, 2010 I 10:48pm
I ....7IKristoffer Tripplaar / SPA President Obama desperately needs a sweeping staff shakeup to
save his presidency. Leslie H. Gelb on why he must reassign Rahm, dump Larry Summers, and get rid
of National Security adviser Jim Jones.
The negative, even dismissive, talk about the Obama White House has reached a critical point. The president must
change key personnel now. Unless he speedily sets up a new team, he will be reduced to a speechmaker. It's mostly a
matter of relocating the Chicago and campaign crowd who surround the Oval Office and inserting people with proven
records of getting things done in Washington and the world.
To be fair, it's not clear whether the bad judgments on priorities, practicalities, and steadiness come from Mr. Obama or
his White House team. Maybe he overpowers them in discussions, or maybe he gives them a role in policymaking far
beyond their experience in that realm. Unless you're there, you don't know. But Mr. Obama is the president, and except
for the right-wing crazies, most Americans still recognize his great talents and promise. It is he who's got to be helped. So
it is they who've got to go.
It is he who's got to be helped. So it is they who've got to go.
One may quarrel with my sense of urgency here. But it's hard to have a conversation with opinion leaders anywhere—and
especially in Washington—that doesn't descend into ripping Obama's White House team. The refrain of complaints is
always the same:
• Obama is forever taking strong stances only to backfill and trim. Most recently, he said he did not ""begrudge"" Wall
Streeters their big earnings because that was part of the market system. This, in the face of his saying only a couple of
weeks ago that such big bonuses were ""shameful.""
• Obama doesn't know what's really going on. Regarding the Middle East, he recently said that ""I think it is absolutely true
that what we did this year didn't produce the kind of breakthrough that we wanted, and if we had anticipated some of
these political problems on both sides earlier, we might not have raised expectations as high."" He had to be totally out of it
not to realize that the Palestinians and Israelis were nowhere close to sitting down with each other and dealing.
• Obama wants to get along with everyone so badly he doesn't recognize real opposition when he sees it—let alone know
how to deal with it. He emerges from a meeting with congressional Republican leaders on health-care reform and says he
is ""an eternal optimist—when those very same Republican leaders just told the press that they don't see any common
ground and believe the administration has to ""scrap the bill and start over.""
• It's even hard to follow his latest Afghan policy. He calls Afghanistan a ""war of necessity"" and orders more than 30,000
new troops there, coupled with an announcement that he'll begin withdrawing some of them in a year plus, only to see
some of his advisers say he will start withdrawals and some say he won't.
I've scribbled similar points in recent months in The Daily Beast. And last week in The Financial Times, Edward Luce
provided a thunderclap on Washington's negative consensus about the incompetence of Obarna's Chicago-laden team.
Luce named names in the White House, and a number of journalists and bloggers strikingly failed to link to the Luce story.
They were said to fear the wrath of the Chicagoans. Steve Clemons, author of The Washington Note, essentially
eridorse.d the Luce finding and slapped his fellow bloggers' wrists for hiding from this issue. The situation is as serious as
it was during the Carter administration. There, two very capable political campaigners--Hamilton Jordan and Jody
Powell—moved into critical White House positions without knowing very much about doing business in Washington. And
they were, quite naturally, too busy to learn. They also added to the ""them"" versus ""us"" (Washington insiders and
bureaucrats versus the regular guys from Georgia) mentality that plagues most administrations.
The Chicagoans and others ""guarding"" the president create their own ""us versus them"" world. It's hard to imagine a policy
conversation between the president and the Chicago crowd, since none of them, except Rahm Emanuel, has Washington
or policy experience. And there isn't much evidence that they bring in strong-minded outsiders to challenge the president
on a regular basis either. The result is an inexperienced president advised by an inexperienced team.
Here are the personnel changes being bruited about in political and policy circles: First, remove Rahm Emanuel as chief
of staff and move him to a senior political adviser slot. No one I've talked to believes he has the management skills and
discipline to run the White House. But he is a terrific political mind and a fighter and should be given the new job and the
time to do his thing. Proven pros who could step right in include the following: Erskine Bowles, president of the University
of North Carolina and former Clinton chief of staff; Leon Panetta, now CIA director and formerly White House chief as well
under Clinton; Sylvia Mathews, a former deputy chief of staff also under Clinton; and John Podesta, another former
Clinton chief who now heads the Center for American Progress. All four are tough and know how to manage.
Replace Lawrence Summers, director of the White House's National Economic Council, with Paul Volcker, the former
chairman of the Federal Reserve. Summers is brilliant and highly controversial; he's been beaten up and is said to want
out anyway. Volcker has unmatched stature, practical experience, and the courage of a lion. He is the only one now in a
position to get down to step-by-step brass tacks on the economy and stop Mr. Obama's weekly gyrations. Others with
proven track records who can help as inside or outside advisers are: Stephen Robert, formerly head of Oppenheimer,
Vincent Mai, former leader of AEA Investors, and Tom Hill of Blackstone. There are also two economic stars in
Washington who'd improve both policymaking and public combat: Sheila Bair, chairwoman of the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation, and Elizabeth Warren, chair of the Congressional Oversight Panel. One outside adviser above all
would help the president see the economic hard choices ahead: Peter G. Peterson, accomplished businessman and
policy head.
David Axelrod, the senior political adviser to the president, needs to concentrate on the next presidential campaign,
wherein his expertise lies, and not on domestic and foreign policy, where he is just another smart unknowledgeable voice.
Good replacements who do know the politics of Washington would be the aforementioned Podesta; and Tom Deschle, the
former Democratic Senate Majority Leader. As for David Plouffe, another senior campaign aide, now in unofficial
residence at the White House, he should be lodged in the nearby Executive Office Building. Senior adviser and Chicago
buddy Valerie Jarrett is too much a part of the inner circle to move, but she should be given a more limited role in making
policy.
Mr. Obama's crowd appears to think that getting things done means his giving another speech. It's nice, but not nearly
enough.
Robert Gibbs needs a rest from being press secretary. Let's put it this way: He wasn't born for daily jousts with pithy
Republicans. His job calls for memorable and pointed phrases and attacks, not circle-the-wagon circumlocutions. Possible
successors? Try Doyle McManus of the L.A. Times, Jake Tapper of ABC News, or Helene Cooper of The New York
Times.
Last but not least, James Jones, the National Security Adviser, has to move on. The career Marine was greatly admired
and respected as Commandant of the Corps and as NATO's military chief. He handled those duties with great skill. But by
wide acclamation inside and outside the White House, he has not emerged as a strategist—perhaps the key requirement
of this key position. The person in that job has to pull everything together—laying out achievable objectives and precise
plans to dispense carefully packaged carrots and sticks. One Democrat who could step in now, despite his age, is
Zbigniew Brzezinski, Jimmy Carter's national-security adviser. He has a first-rate strategic mind—a rare quality—and
knows how to deliver results. Obama will need to iron out Zbig's lack of sympathy toward Israel and Russia.
Also available are a boatload of first-class retired diplomats with the judgment and background needed to perform the
National Security Council job effectively. They would be greeted with applause both at home and abroad. Try former
ambassadors Thomas Pickering, Morton Abramowitz, Frank Wisner, Reginald Bartholomew, and Winston Lord. They
have it all. At a minimum, they and others like them should form the core of a group that meets regularly with Obama on
strategy.
Yes, many of the pros suggested above have reached their golden years. But 70 and even 80 are the new 60. They all
possess the necessary energy, experience and rare skill in delivering results. They are also shovel-ready. As a critical
bonus, they could and would mentor the next generation down, a very talented one indeed, to succeed them in two or
three years. To lead America and the world, Obama has to grow far beyond his present propensity to treat problems as
intellectual puzzles—to collect facts and hear the arguments. The great tasks of governing demand proven intuition in
sensing what's achievable, which buttons to push when, how to buy the time for power to take hold, how to make
adjustments without flagrantly foolish rhetoric, how to avoid failures that only diminish power, and how to succeed in small
as well as large ways. With a team versed in such arts and skills, President Obama and America would succeed.

Former aide urges Obama to regain 'political narrative'
By Edward Luce in Washington
Published: February 15 2010
Barack Obama, US president, has lost control of the political narrative and needs to make more use of his cabinet in
order to regain it, says John Podesta, the man who headed the president's transition team.
""My friends in the White House would agree with this, that they lost the narrative,"" Mr Podesta said in an interview for
View from DC, the Financial Times' video series from Washington. ""Clearly that needs not one speech once in a while: it
needs, I think, to be constantly reinforced. And not just by the president, but by his entire team ... He's got a terrific
cabinet. Use it. Get out into the country and use it.""
Mr Podesta, who was also a chief of staff to Bill Clinton, drew parallels with the former president's difficulties in his first
two years, which culminated in the 1994 Republican takeover of Congress following the failure of healthcare reform.
When asked whether the failure of this latest attempt at healthcare reform would result in a similar electoral
""massacre"" for the Democratic party at the mid-term elections in November, he said: ""I subscribe to that view.""
Mr Podesta founded the Centre for American Progress, Washington's largest liberal think-tank, which was often
described as a ""government-in-exile"" during the years George W. Bush was in the White House. He said Mr Obama had
three options with healthcare reform. First, try to enact the whole thing by using the budget reconciliation process,
which would enable it to pass with 51 votes. The Democrats lost their controlling 60-seat super-majority last month in a
election defeat in Massachusetts.
The second would be to pass a watered down bill with Republican support The third would be to abandon the attempt,
as Mr Clinton did in 1993.
Mr Podesta, whom Mr Obama still regularly consults, said there was still a better than 50:50 chance of getting reform
through. ""The worst option among the three is doing nothing, and so they're going to have to figure out which track is
viable,"" he said. ""It may mean doing it with only Democratic votes. But if that is such, then so be it.""
He painted a fairly bleak view of the overall health of US politics. ""It sucks,"" he said. Pointing to a strategy of
obstructionism by Republican lawmakers, he said: ""I think the president is trying to re-engage with Republicans, but,
quite frankly, he's not dealing with the party of [Abraham] Lincoln. He's dealing with the party of [Sarah] Palin.""
The growth of partisanship and the increasing difficulty in getting any big reforms through the Senate were threatening
to turn the US into, ""in essence, a parliamentary system without majority rule"", where the opposition automatically
opposes any serious initiatives.
The political stasis in California provided the writing on the wall for the US as a whole, he said. Since the 1978 passage of
Proposition 13 in the state, all budget changes had required a two-thirds majority. ""And so nothing gets done.""

ambling Over Rahm
by Leslie H. Gelb
February 22, 2010 I 3:26pm
-
L - Alex Brandon / AP Photo Leslie H. Gelb's call for White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel to
be reassigned spurred a circle-the-wagons reaction from pro- (or perhaps even anti-) Rahm forces.
Gelb sifts the fallout for clues.
When you write that the president of the United States should replace his chief of staff, someone will fire back. So it was
that Rahm Emanuel apparently struck back at my piece last week on the Daily Beast through a column in Sunday's
Washington Post. Only this time, the return fire had a rare twist, one that could produce Washington convulsions. It was
seemingly aimed at me (and others who published suggestions of Emanuel's limitations as chief). But whether it was
intentional or not, the volley actually struck the president himself.
Here is the story, a very Washington tale of stretching permissible criticism of power holders, of pungent media leaks, of
labyrinthine speculation as to who is doing what to whom.
Maybe the leaker thought the way to get rid of Rahm completely was to brand him as a ""traitor"" to the boss.
With a headline ""Replace Rahm,"" I wrote last Tuesday that Emanuel lacked the managerial skills, discipline, and strategic
ability to get things done as chief of staff. I argued he should be moved over to a political adviser slot, where his
considerable, can-do talents would better serve his boss. I targeted others as well, mostly in Mr. Obama's Chicago crowd.
Several writers also blasted this crowd, mostly with unsigned bullets, but never crossed the red line calling for their
removal. I wrote the piece because it essentially reflected the waves of anti-White House staff critiques breaking over
Washington, but rarely heard outside its drawing rooms. I did it because I believed the president was running out of
chances to succeed and needed better and tougher staffers. I did it because if he failed, the nation failed.
Then came the inevitable blast back, a devastating leak, in a piece by Dana Milbank, a respected Washington journalist.
Interesting that the leaker selected Milbank. He's sort of a half-reporter, half-columnist who roams the entire capital city,
not just the White House. The leaker must have felt safe because Milbank has so many sources all over town, making the
leakers harder to trace.
The Milbank headline read: ""Why Obama needs Rahm at the top."" It began: ""Let us now praise Rahm Emanuel. No,
seriously."" Then, he lists me and a couple others who also criticized Rahm. ""But,"" he continued, ""sacking Emanuel is the
last thing the president should do.""
Then, Milbank (and presumably the leaker) delivered the surprise and wounding blow – to the president himself. ""Obama's
first year fell apart in large part because he didn't follow his chief of staffs advice on crucial matters. Arguably, Emanuel is
the only person keeping Obama from becoming Jimmy Carter.""
Then, Milbank (and the leaker) took his first shot, not at me, but at congressional liberals and everyone in the Chicago
crowd except Rahm. ""Obama's problem,"" Milbank continued, ""is that his other confidants—particularly Valerie Jarrett and
Robert Gibbs, and, to a lesser extent, David Axelrod—are part of the Cult of Obama. In love with the president, they
believe he is a transformational figure who needn't dirty his hands in politics.""
So, it was ""their"" fault—until you see the real blow landed beyond them and on the President himself. ""The president
would have been better off heeding Emanuel's counsel,"" but instead ""overruled"" him on several key Rahm
recommendations: not rushing to close Guantanamo and bringing terrorists to U.S. prisons, not trying Khalid Sheikh
Mohammed in New York, and going for a smaller health care bill focused on popular items with Republican support. ""The
result was,"" Milbank wrote, ""as the world now knows, disastrous."" In other words, Mr. Obama could have thrived and
saved himself on key issues had he only listened to Rahm.
It sure looks like Rahm (or someone near and dear to him) trying to save himself at the president's expense. This is an
incredibly unusual leak, seemingly a chief of staff undermining his own boss, the president. Worse, it details specific
advice Rahm personally gave Mr. Obama in the absolute privacy of the Oval Office. Presidents go crazy at such breaches
of confidence.
Which is why another possibility has to be considered: that Rahm was not the leaker. The leak was so egregious, so anti-
Chicago crowd minus Rahm, so devastating to the president, that Emanuel couldn't have been stupid enough to leak a
story where he was the sole, surviving hero. Remember, too, that my piece did not recommend kicking Rahm out of the
White House, just sliding him over into a political adviser job where he could practice small-bite pragmatism. Maybe
someone didn't want Rahm around the White House at all, in any position. Maybe the leaker thought the way to get rid of
Rahm completely was to brand him as a ""traitor"" to the boss. Maybe the leaker belonged to that contingent of self-
mutilating liberal Democrats who have always viewed Rahm as too centrist and pragmatic.
Of course, I don't know what's afoot. And of course, Milbank put his own views into his own article. But someone gave him
the specifics, the precious ammunition about Rahm's private advice to Mr. Obama. The story is not over.

Republican dissidents suspected after blast outside courthouse in Newry as evacuation was taking place

A car bomb exploded last night outside the courthouse in Newry, Northern Ireland, police said. There were no initial
reports of any injuries in the blast.
Police said the vehicle was abandoned at the front of the building in the Co Down town at around lOpm. Officers were in
the process of evacuating the area when the car exploded.
Suspicion is bound to fall on republican dissidents opposed to the peace process. The incident comes only days after a
mortar bomb failed to detonate outside a police station in the nearby Co Armagh village of Keady.
The chairman of the nationalist SDLP in Newry, Gary McKeown, condemned those responsible. ""Lives could have been
lost as a result of this bombing,"" he said. ""It serves absolutely no purpose and does nothing for the community, or the
cause of a united Ireland. If people want to advance their beliefs, they should enter the democratic process and debate
with their political opponents, rather than resorting to violence. Planting bombs outside courthouses will achieve nothing.""
Earlier this month, police on both sides of the Irish border launched separate operations against dissident republicans.
Police in Northern Ireland arrested two men and a woman in connection with the murder of Constable Stephen Carroll, the
first PSNI officer killed by terrorists in the province.
The Continuity IRA shot the 48-year-old policeman dead on a housing estate in Craigavon, County Armagh, on 9 March
last year. His murder came just 48 hours after the Real IRA killed two British soldiers outside the Massereene barracks in
Antrim. In September police discovered a massive 600lb bomb in the south Armagh village of Forkhill.
On Sunday, Republican Sinn Fein, political allies of the Continuity IRA, claimed masked undercover soldiers carried out
surveillance on two housing estates in Lurgan, Co Armagh, in recent weeks. They claimed the men were scouting the
areas in white civilian vans. Republican Sinn Fein said the soldiers belonged to the Special Reconnaissance Regiment.
The alleged presence of SRR soldiers — formerly known as the 14th Intelligence Unit — is controversial because British
troops are meant to have been pulled off the streets, especially in nationalist areas.
Britain heading for hung parliament
Guardian/ICM poll
Tories might not win election outright, suggests new survey

The Conservatives should no longer count on winning the election outright, according to a Guardian/ICM poll published
today.
The new survey suggests Britain is on course for a hung parliament amid faltering public support for David Cameron's
party.
The opposition have also lost ground on key policy issues, including the economy, and in particular may be losing their
campaign against Labour's so-called ""death tax"". Labour leads the Tories by eight points as the party with the best policy
on care for the elderly.
The two parties are neck and neck on their ability to sort out the economic crisis, against a nine-point Tory lead when the
question was last asked in August 2009.
With no more than three months to go until polling day, the Conservatives have fallen to 37%, down three on last month's
Guardian/ICM poll and down two on another ICM poll earlier this month.
The party has not fallen so low in an ICM poll since the tail end of the banking crisis, last falling to 37% in February 2008.
As recently as last October the Tories hit 45% in an ICM poll and the party will be alarmed by this latest evidence that the
race is tightening, which confirms the findings of some other recent polls.
Meanwhile Labour's support, at 30%, is eight points up on its absolute ICM bottom last May, and slightly above its
average for the second part of last year. However, there is no sign of either a boost for the party following Gordon Brown's
Piers Morgan interview or a fall after this weekend's reports about Brown bullying his staff.
Labour's support is up one point on the last Guardian/ICM poll and unchanged from the most recent ICM poll. Research
began last Friday and most was carried out before the serialisation of Andrew Rawnsley's book in yesterday's Observer,
which may have affected Labour support. Around a fifth of responses were collected on Sunday.
Nick Clegg's hopes of a powerful place in a hung parliament are also boosted by today's poll, which puts the Liberal
Democrats on 20%, unchanged from the most recent ICM and down one on last month's Guardian poll.
All this suggests that Labour and the Lib Dems are holding steady while the Conservatives lose some ground to smaller
parties, which are on a total of 13%. Nationalists are on 5%, Ukip and the Greens on 3% each and the BNP on 2%.
Estimates of what these shares would mean for the parties on polling day vary, but a 7% lead is at the margins of what
the Tories think they need to win a majority. One academic calculation suggests the result would leave Labour only 25
seats behind the Tories in a hung parliament, although any improved Tory performance in marginal seats would offset
that.

Justice and policing powers will be devolved to Northern Ireland's power-sharing government from 12 April in a historic
deal agreed by the main parties that ""opens a new chapter"" after decades of violence, Gordon Brown said today.
Standing alongside his Irish counterpart, Brian Cowen, at a press conference at Hillsborough Castle outside Belfast, the
prime minister said the ""inspirational"" agreement between Sinn Fein and the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) was a
foundation for lasting peace.
The deal — finally agreed to by the DUP last night and described as a final piece in the jigsaw after a long search for
peace — comes after two weeks of round-the-clock negotiations and brings an end to fears that the power-sharing
government might collapse.
It will see policing and justice powers devolved from Westminster to the assembly within weeks and includes new plans
on overseeing parades.
Brown, who travelled to Belfast this morning, said the agreement had been possible because of ""a new spirit of mutual co-
operation and respect"".
The deal meets a key Sinn Fein demand and prevents the republican party from walking out of the power-sharing
executive. In return, the DUP has secured reforms to the way loyalist marches are handled in Northern Ireland, including
the abolition of the Parades Commission, a body most unionists regard as biased in favour of nationalists.
A cross-community vote will now be held in the Stormont assembly on 9 March before the policing and justice powers are
devolved from London on 12 April.
Brown told reporters: ""The achievements have been as great as they are inspirational. This moment and this agreement
belongs to the people of Northern Ireland, all of the people, and now more than ever before so does their future ... This is
the last chapter of a long and troubled story and the beginning of a new chapter after decades of violence, years of talks,
weeks of stalemate.""
Cowen praised both unionists and nationalists for making ""fair and balanced compromises"" to bridge the divisions and
said the quality of the negotiations meant that the ""devolved institutions can and will work"".
The Northern Ireland secretary, Shaun Woodward, said the deal would further isolate republican dissidents who have
launched three separate gun and bomb attacks against police stations in the province over the last 10 days. The deal
would ""absolutely"" make Northern Ireland a safer place, he said.
The DUP leader, Peter Robinson, said the agreement ""will be more enduring because of the time spent"" in forming it.
Referring back to the Belfast Agreement of 1998 when negotiations bore fruit at the 11th hour, the Sinn Fein president,
Gerry Adams, described the current deal and the rescue of power-sharing as ""yet another very good Friday"".
Jeffrey Donaldson told the Guardian the DUP's 36-strong assembly team was now unanimously in favour of the deal.
But the Ulster Unionist party (UUP) has yet to officially back the package which will allow the assembly to set up
legislation to change the way parades are judged.
A UUP spokeswoman said members wanted to see the proposed agreement before giving their response to the two
governments. ""We have not had sight of this agreement and until we do we will not be signing up to it,"" she said.
The talks, which centred on Hillsborough Castle, outside Belfast, are the longest set of continuous negotiations held in the
near 20-year peace process. Sinn Fein had accused the DUP of stalling on the transfer of policing powers for the last
three years and it was feared that failure to find agreement could see the collapse of the power-sharing government led by
the two parties.
The agreement finally came near midnight at Stormont's parliament building. Earlier in the evening Sinn Fein had said the
basis of a deal was on the table and it was giving the DUP leadership the time to persuade its party to accept it. Robinson
emerged from a meeting of party colleagues to confirm that he had secured unanimous support for the proposals. Earlier
in the week up to 14 DUP assembly members had opposed a proposed deal because it did not give unionists enough
concessions.
Robinson said he would now look to gain the support of the community and the smaller assembly parties for the deal. ""We
have a basis upon which we can go forward and recommend it [the deal] to our party, to the other parties in Northern
Ireland and to the community.
""An essential element of the Democratic Unionist Party's manifesto is the requirement for community confidence; we
believe this can be the basis for gaining that confidence.""
However the leader of the hardline Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV), Jim Allister, questioned why the 14 DUP rebels had
changed their minds.
""The deal hasn't changed, only the snowmen of the DUP, who melted once the heat came on,"" Allister said.
The DUP now faces a struggle to ward off the TUV threat in the forthcoming general election: Allister will portray the deal
as a sell-out of unionist principles and a sop to republicanism.","['SidNorthern', 'Ireland', 'Northern', 'Ireland', 'Northern', 'Ireland', 'Hillsborough', 'Castle', 'Belfast', 'Belfast', 'Northern', 'Ireland', 'Stormont', 'London', 'Northern', 'Ireland', 'Northern', 'Ireland', 'Northern', 'Ireland', 'Belfast', 'Hillsborough', 'Castle', 'Belfast', 'Stormont', 'Northern', 'Ireland']"

Obama Advisers to Aid Tories' Election TV
Battle
By IAIN MARTIN
Advisers close to U.S. President Barack Obama have been drafted by David Cameron to help the Conservatives in their
election campaign against Gordon Brown and Labour.
The Tories have signed a contract with Squier, Knapp, Dunn Communications—a Washington-based Democrat-leaning
political consultancy— to help them prepare for the first-ever television debates between leaders during a British election
camialin.
David Cameron
The firm also is expected to offer some advice more broadly to the Tory leader on the Conservative campaign in the lead-
up to voting, likely to take place on May 6.
Opinion polls have suggested a narrowing of the gap between the two main parties—with the Conservative lead cut to six
to seven points in the two most recent polls earlier this week.
A Conservative spokesman confirmed Wednesday night that Squier, Knapp, Dunn will act as consultants for the television
debates.
Anita Dunn, one of the firm's senior partners, was hired by Mr. Obama in 2006 ahead of his run for president and was the
communications director at the White House until November. Bill Knapp, another senior partner and veteran of the
successful Obama campaign, is a close adviser to the mayor of New York City, Michael Bloomberg.
Tory campaign insiders say they have been talking to the firm for several months after a recommendation from Mayor
Bloomberg, who retains close links with the British Tory leadership.
He was a lifelong Democrat who switched to the Republicans when he first ran for mayor.
The British general election is taking on a particularly American flavor, with the prime minister also understood to be
seeking advice from a consultant based in the U.S. The Times of London reported that Joel Benenson, a polling and
strategy adviser who worked on the team that readied Mr. Obama for the American TV debates, is helping Mr. Brown.
None of the British parties has experience of leaders' debates and as a consequence are looking outside for help.
However, it is the decision of the Tories to reach out across the traditional ideological divide to senior Democrats that is
surprising. Their party usually has looked to Republican strategists for advice, with Labour and the Democrats retaining
close links.
Ms. Dunn is a veteran of Democrat politics, beginning her career in Jimmy Carter's administration and subsequently
working as a consultant on many election campaigns. She returned to the White House with President Obama but left late
last year when her husband, Robert Bauer, the president's personal attorney, was unveiled as the incoming White House
counsel.
Mr. Knapp made television ads for the Obama campaign, has worked on five presidential campaigns and played a leading
role in Mayor Bloomberg's three election wins.
The pre-election atmosphere in the U.K. has become increasingly fraught, with the parties trading blows on allegations of
bullying inside No. 10 Downing Street made in a new book on the Labour government by journalist Andrew Rawnsley.
In the latest developments, the prime minister Wednesday in a GMTV breakfast television interview denied that he had
known about briefings by some of his aides against Alistair Darling, his chancellor of the exchequer.
In a remarkably frank interview Tuesday with Jeff Randall of Sky News, Mr. Darling said that when he remarked in the
summer of 2008 that the worst global recession in 60 years was underway, No. 10 had ""unleashed the forces of hell.""
Mr Brown said on GMTV: ""I was never part of anything to do with this. Look, this was the most amazing time.. .and lots of
things were happening in this time. But I would never instruct anybody to do anything other than support my chancellor,
and I think Alistair will confirm that.""
At a rowdy Prime Minister's Questions in the House of Commons Wednesday, Mr. Cameron questioned Mr. Brown on the
row.

Brown hails 'new chapter' in Northern Ireland
as end to years of violence
Promise of US investment follows 'momentous' agreement that seals power-sharing framework
• Henry McDonald, Ireland correspondent

British and Irish PMs endorse power-sharing deal Link to this video
Northern Ireland's leaders have been rewarded with the promise of a new US investment programme after securing a
historic deal today which saved power sharing.
Gordon Brown and his Irish counterpart, Brian Cowen, flew into Northern Ireland to put their seal of approval on the deal,
which will create a Department of Justice, gives unionists concessions on the issue of Protestant parades and saves the
power-sharing executive from collapse.
Brown said the achievements over the longest period of unbroken negotiations since the peace process began 16 years
ago were inspirational.
""This is the last chapter of a long and troubled story and the beginning of a new chapter after decades of violence, years
of talks, weeks of stalemate.""
Tonight the White House said Barack Obama saw the deal as ""an important step to greater peace and prosperity for all
communities on the island.""
Obama would also meet Cowen, the DUP leader and first minister Peter Robinson and the deputy first minister, Sinn
Fein's Martin McGuinness, in Washington on St Patrick's Day next month.
Earlier, Hillary Clinton, the US secretary of state, said the agreement between the DUP and Sinn Fein was a ""shining
example to other parts of the world locked in religious and ethnic conflicts"".
As a result of the deal, she said: ""The people of Northern Ireland are poised to build a thriving society on this stronger
foundation.
Our economic envoy, DecIan Kelly, will continue to help Northern Ireland reap the dividends of peace, including economic
growth, international investment and new opportunities. -
In the near future, Declan and I will host first minister Robinson and deputy first minister McGuinness in Washington.""
The Irish prime minister said the agreement reached ""presents a real opportunity to renew the partnership which is the life
blood of the devolved institutions. The people of Northern Ireland yearn for this constructive partnership to deliver tangible
outcomes that improve their lives.""
Referring back to the Belfast agreement of 1998, Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, described today's agreement as
""yet another good Friday."" After reaching an agreement just before midnight on Thursday, the parties in the Northern
Ireland assembly must now vote to put the compromise package in place. They will vote on 9 March to devolve policing
and justice powers, which will then create a justice ministry on 12 April — a key Sinn Fein demand throughout these
negotiations.
Under the agreement, a six-member working group, appointed by Robinson and McGuinness, will formulate a framework
for handling contentious marches and the phasing out of the Parades Commission.
The new body will encourage local people to find solutions to parading problems, with the rights of marchers and
residents taken into account. It will complete its work within three weeks, when the Northern Ireland executive will transfer
responsibilities for parading legislation from Westminster and table a new bill based on the group's proposals.
An executive working group will be set up, in the hands of the SDLP and Ulster Unionists, to improve the way the power-
sharing cabinet is run. Robinson and McGuinness will address issues still outstanding from the 2006 St Andrews
agreement that led to the DUP-Sinn Fein deals. These include legislative measures to protect the rights of Irish language
speakers.
Ian Paisley Jr, the North Antrim assembly member and son of the DUP's founder, described the agreement as a ""win for
unionism"".
Paisley said his party had negotiated the end of the Parades Commission, which most unionists regard as biased in
favour of nationalists. He added that unionist critics of the deal had ""no alternative except the imposition of joint authority
from London and Dublin"".
Mindful of attacks on the DUP by the hardline Traditional Unionist Voice, Robinson said: ""There are some who will play
politics with this agreement, but the real focus in the months to come must be on building an administration at Stormont
that our whole community identifies with and supports.""
Jim Allister, the TUV leader and a former DUP MEP, said he was ""relishing the prospect"" of a general election contest
with his former party. Allister will stand for the TUV in Ian Paisley Sr's North Antrim constituency.
""In football terms I see this result as a five to one win for Sinn Fein. They get their date for policing and justice. Secondly,
their veto can be exercised over the justice ministry. They now have working party on Irish language. North/South bodies
are strengthened. And finally there is a stronger north-south parliamentary forum. The DUP only get a view of parading
issues.
""Sinn Fein are laughing all the way to the next staging post,"" he said.
Shaun Woodward, the Northern Ireland secretary, said the deal was bad news for republican dissidents determined to
destabilise the power-sharing government.
He said a powerful message was being sent out to the dissidents that there are now ""two groups of people who were once
terrible rivals [who] have found a way through a very big challenge"".
But the Real IRA, Continuity IRA and Oglaigh na hEireann are unlikely to be moved by the accord at Hillsborough. In the
past seven days the republican dissidents have carried out three gun and bomb attacks on police stations across
Northern Ireland.
Republican sources have told the Guardian that the groups are likely to intensify their armed campaigns when policing
and justice powers are transferred to Belfast.","['Northern', 'Ireland', 'US', 'Ireland', 'Northern', 'Ireland', 'US', 'Northern', 'Ireland', 'Washington', 'US', 'Northern', 'Ireland', 'Northern', 'Ireland', 'Washington', 'Northern', 'Ireland', 'Belfast', 'Northern', 'Ireland', 'Northern', 'Ireland', 'North', 'Antrim', 'London', 'Dublin', 'Stormont', 'North', 'Antrim', 'Northern', 'Ireland', 'Oglaigh', 'Hillsborough', 'Northern', 'Ireland', 'Belfast']"

Reid: Shelby Has Hold On All Nominees
Friday, Feb. 5, 2010
Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., has placed a blanket hold on all executive nominations on the Senate calendar in an effort
to win concessions from the Obama administration and Pentagon on a variety of fronts affecting his home state, according
to aides to Senate Majority Leader Reid.
Reid spokeswoman Regan Lachapelle said Shelby is blocking more than 70 pending nominations. Reid can force a vote
on any nomination by filing cloture.
Because of the time required to vote on multiple nominations, the Senate processes most nominations by unanimous
consent. Any one senator can block any of those nominations by objecting to a unanimous consent request to take it up.
The nominations will remain stalled unless Reid files cloture.
While holds are frequent, Senate aides said a blanket hold represents a far more aggressive use of the power than is
normal.
""He should not be holding up 70-plus nominees for a parochial issue,"" a Democratic aide said. ""They're qualified and they
should be moving forward.""
Disclosure of the blanket hold came after two days in which top Democrats voiced mounting frustration with Republican
holds on executive nominees.
'We've got a huge backlog of folks who are unanimously viewed as well qualified -- nobody has a specific objection to
them -- but end up having a hold on them because of some completely unrelated piece of business,"" President Obama
said Wednesday in a televised meeting with Senate Democrats.
On the Senate floor Thursday, Reid, Senate Majority Whip Durbin, Senate Judiciary Chairman Patrick Leahy and
Senate Armed Services Chairman Carl Levin ripped Republicans for holds on national security nominees and judges.
Reid, who kept the Senate in pro forma session over recent holidays to prevent former President George W. Bush from
making recess appointments, said he has grown so frustrated he might advocate such appointments, which the president
can make when the Senate is out of session.
'What alternatives do we have?"" Reid said on the floor Thursday. ""What alternative do we have?""
Earlier in the day, a spokesman for Shelby said the senator has placed holds on ""several pending nominees due to
unaddressed national security concerns,"" including frustrations with the Air Force's handling of the competition for an
aerial refueling tanker. The spokesman did not respond to later requests for comment about the blanket hold.
Northrop Grumman Corp. and EADS, the European consortium behind Airbus, and Boeing Co. are vying for the high-
stakes contract, potentially worth $40 billion. The Northrop/EADS team would build the planes in Mobile, Ala., but has
threatened to pull out of the competition unless the Air Force makes changes to a draft request for proposals.
""Nearly 10 years after the U.S. Air Force announced plans to replace the aging tanker fleet, we still do not have a
transparent and fair acquisition process to move forward,"" the spokesman said. ""The Department of Defense must
recognize that the draft request for proposal needs to be significantly and substantively changed.""
Defense Secretary Gates Wednesday told House lawmakers the Pentagon plans to issue the final request for proposals
soon, and will proceed with the program whether or not there is a competition.
""Obviously we would like to have a competition for it, and we hope that both companies will agree to participate, but we
will move forward,"" Gates said. ""We have to have new tankers.""
In addition to the tanker issue, Shelby's spokesman said he is frustrated that the Obama administration won't build an
Alabama-based FBI center to analyze improvised explosive devices.
Shelby secured a $45 million earmark in the FY08 omnibus appropriations bill for a Terrorist Explosive Device Analytical
Center to be set up at the Army's Redstone Arsenal.
""Sen. Shelby will continue to work with the FBI to give them the capability to coordinate intelligence as well as forensic
and technical exploitation related to IEDs, but this administration's coddling of terrorists makes this an uphill effort,"" the
spokesman said. ""He has made the administration aware of these concerns and is willing to discuss them at any time.""
Also Thursday, Vice President Biden said he was so frustrated by Republican foot-dragging that he was considering
whether Senate rules should be changed.
""There's a little disappointment in that it seems like the only way to do business up here anymore is with a supermajority
on almost everything,"" Biden said moments after swearing in Sen. Scott Brown, R-Mass., who gives Republicans 41
votes, enough to filibuster on any issue.
'What I have been doing is spending a lot of time having my staff go back and scrub this, you know, the use of the
filibuster and how it's worked,"" Biden said. ""This is not a constitutional requirement.""
Biden defended the 60-vote requirement, calling it ""a useful tool. It's legitimate, but from my perspective having served
here, having been elected seven times, I've never seen a time when it's become sort of standard operating procedure. ...
Requiring a supermajority is just not a good way to do business.""

4136,"Soaring cost of healthcare sets a record By Noam N. Levey February 4, 2010 Los Angeles Times
Spending was 17.3% of the economy last year. The share paid by the U.S. will soon exceed 50%, a study says.
In a stark reminder of growing costs, the government has released a new estimate that healthcare spending grew to a
record 17.3% of the U.S. economy last year, marking the largest one-year jump in its share of the economy since the
government started keeping such records half a century ago.
The almost $2.5 trillion spent in 2009 was $134 billion more than the previous year, when healthcare consumed 16.2%
of the gross domestic product, according to an annual report by independent actuaries at the federal Centers for
Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, scheduled for release Thursday.
The nonpartisan accounting agency also projected that as early as next year, the country could mark another milestone
as government picks up more than half of the nation's total healthcare tab for the first time.
The rise in current costs, driven in part by surging spending in Medicare and Medicaid, and the bleak projections for the
future do not take into account changes that may come if Democrats revive their healthcare overhaul legislation.
The report appears likely to fuel further debate about the health bills now stalled in Congress.
In the absence of change, the report raises a grim prospect for the country -- a healthcare system consuming an ever
greater and potentially unsustainable share of the economy even as private health coverage lags.
Last year, CMS estimated that government spending on healthcare would not overtake private spending until 2016,
compared with 2011 or 2012 in the current report.
""The health system is hurting, and we are seeing that in these numbers,"" said Karen Davis, president of the
Commonwealth Fund, a leading authority on healthcare policy.
The report also points up the financial cost of the so-called Great Recession and the growing pressure it is putting on
state and local governments.
Federal and state spending on Medicaid, the nation's primary health insurance program for low-income Americans,
jumped nearly 10% in 2009, according to the report. Medicare spending, meanwhile, shot up just over 8%.
Obama and many healthcare experts have argued that reshaping the healthcare system will ultimately make it more
efficient, even if overall health spending continues to increase -- a claim Republicans dispute.
Fueled by new technology, an aging population, rising incomes and other changes, spending on medical care has been
consuming a larger and larger share of the nation's economy for years, jumping from about 5% of the gross domestic
product in 1960 to nearly 14% in 2000.
But the recession that began in 2007 accelerated that trend, as the economy contracted while healthcare spending
continued to increase, according to CMS.
Even now, with the economy slowly recovering, the government expects that the growth of healthcare spending will
outpace the expansion of the economy. By 2020, 1 of every 5 dollars spent in the U.S. is expected to go to healthcare.
Some economists believe that this is not necessarily a problem, as the healthcare industry can provide good jobs and
improve both health and productivity.
But there is growing concern that as much as a third of the medical care delivered in this country does not help patients.
""Are we getting value for the dollar? That is the question,"" said Len Nichols, health policy director at the centrist New
America Foundation. ""If you believe that so much medical care is unnecessary, as I do, then it is criminal that we are
spending so much.""
Stuart Butler, vice president for domestic and economic policy at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said that the
numbers underscore the need for more aggressive action to curb spending.
""The only way to do this is to simply spend less,"" Butler said, warning that the health bills being pushed on Capitol Hill do
the opposite.
CMS officials noted that healthcare spending has been increasing even as the number of Americans without health
insurance is growing, another sign of problems with the system.
""With higher unemployment, people lose their jobs [and] many of them lose their healthcare coverage in the process.
And under current law, they don't have much to fall back on,"" said Richard S. Foster, chief actuary.
Foster said that the report by his office indicated that two of the main trends driving calls for a health overhaul -- rising
costs and shrinking numbers of people with health coverage -- are essentially the same as they were when the
healthcare debate began last year.
""Nothing much has changed in that regard,"" he said.
Inefficiency is becoming a particularly acute problem for state and federal governments, which the report shows are
increasingly supporting the nation's healthcare system.
Half a century ago, government accounted for just a quarter of all healthcare spending. Now, as the cost of caring for
elderly and poor Americans swells, government's share of the total bill is fast becoming greater than that of the private
sector.
The trend accelerated in the recession, as Washington spent billions of dollars to help states prop up Medicaid programs
being strained by the growing ranks of the unemployed and uninsured.
The healthcare legislation being debated on Capitol Hill could increase the government commitment to healthcare as
the federal government boosts the Medicaid program and provides billions of dollars of subsidies to low- and moderate-
income Americans to help them buy insurance.
But in a separate report a month ago, CMS actuaries estimated that the Senate healthcare bill would boost total
healthcare spending by less than 1% over the next decade, in large part because the legislation includes initiatives to
make Medicare more efficient.","['U.S.', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'Washington']"

summit sidelines
Climate talks overshadowed by divisive subject of Tony Blair's candidacy to be Europe's first president
European government chiefs gather in Brussels this evening for a summit likely to be the first occasion to broach the
divisive subject of Tony Blair's candidacy to be Europe's first president.
The topic is not formally on the agenda of a meeting that will be dominated by wrangling over climate change funding and
how to get the Czech president, Vaclav Klaus, to add the final signature to the reformist Lisbon treaty. But senior
diplomats predicted there would be intense private discussion on the fringes of the summit over the question: who will get
the plum job of first sitting president of the European council, the pre-eminent EU forum that brings leaders together for
summits at least four times a year.
David Miliband, the foreign secretary, said today that Blair would give Europe a ""strong voice"" on the global stage, but his
comments were seized on by his Conservative shadow, William Hague, who said the debate over the presidency proved
that the UK should have held a referendum on the Lisbon treaty.
Officially, the job does not exist until Klaus finalises Czech ratification of the treaty, expected within weeks. While Blair
personally has kept quiet about his ambitions, the British government is campaigning increasingly assertively on the
former prime minister's behalf.
""We will be making the case for a strong, internationally known figure who can open doors in [foreign] capitals,"" said an
official. ""There is only one candidate.""
That was not a reference to Jean-Claude Juncker, the veteran Luxembourg prime minister and European fixer, who is the
only contender so far to have openly declared his candidacy. He emerged this week as the anti-Blair.
Juncker looks certain to fail in his bid for the top job. But he may well succeed in destroying Blair's chances, being viewed
as a stalking horse who will vanish to make way for a third unknown contender.
While the Blair debate rages on the sidelines of the summit, the big priority for the Swedish government chairing the
meeting is to try to break a deadlock on EU funding of climate change programmes in the developing world ahead of the
Copenhagen conference in December.
Berlin and Warsaw are the keys to a deal, but the prospects for a breakthrough look dim. Fredrik Reinfeldt, the Swedish
prime minister, warned that Europe's credibility on global warming was at stake.
In recent weeks European governments have locked horns over the financing package and have been unable to reach
agreement. The aim is to come up with pledges of an EU fund of up to €15bn (£13.4bn) a year by 2020 for transfers to the
developing countries to combat global warming. The overall package is central to a Copenhagen deal.
But with the other big players, especially the US, which is reluctant to commit to a figure, Germany believes Europe
should not show its hand until the Copenhagen negotiations. The European commission and others such as the UK and
the Scandinavians believe agreeing on a figure in advance would strengthen Europe's global leadership role on climate
change and send a strong signal to other potential signatories.
The Poles and other eastern Europeans are unhappy at being asked to stump up for developing countries such as Brazil,
which is wealthier than the poorer EU members. The Poles are refusing to agree a package and figures for Copenhagen
unless it is first decided how the bill will be split among the EU's 27 governments. In the midst of a financial crisis, the
eastern Europeans say they cannot afford the climate change fund.
Angela Merkel, sworn in yesterday for a second term as German chancellor, will be pivotal to any climate change
financing deal and her answer to the Blair question may also be decisive. So far, she has been hedging her bets.
While Nicolas Sarkozy, the French president, is known to support Blair with reservations, there are no German candidates
for the two big new jobs being created under Lisbon — the European president and a European foreign minister or high
representative for foreign and security policy.
In Paris last night the French and German leaders discussed the posts, although there was little information on whether
they reached a pact. Sarkozy said the two leaders agreed on ""almost everything"".
Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg — all said to nurse ambitions to secure the presidential post
themselves — have come out publicly against Blair on the grounds that he would neglect the interests of smaller EU
member states — 19 out of the total 27.
Adding his voice to the argument, Demitris Christofias, the president of Cyprus, said a council president ""from a small
country would be more objective and more consensual. The European Union is a family of compromises.""
The Dutch centre-right prime minister and possible contender, Jan-Peter Balkenende, has come under pressure this week
to renounce European presidential ambitions since his move to Brussels could trigger early elections and the fall of his
government.
Christofias emphasised that tonight the priority would be to get the Klaus blocking of the Lisbon treaty lifted rather than
focusing on who gets what under Lisbon.
Senior diplomats agreed it was too early to discuss names. If Klaus signs thetreaty soon, a special summit would be
convened next month to decide on the president and foreign minister, also leaving the European commission chief, Jose
Manuel Barroso, to put together a new team.","['Europe', 'Brussels', 'Europe', 'Lisbon', 'EU', 'Europe', 'UK', 'Lisbon', 'Luxembourg', 'EU', 'Copenhagen', 'Berlin', 'Warsaw', 'Europe', 'Copenhagen', 'US', 'Germany', 'Europe', 'Copenhagen', 'UK', 'Europe', 'Brazil', 'Copenhagen', 'Lisbon', 'Paris', 'Austria', 'Belgium', 'Netherlands', 'Luxembourg', 'Cyprus', 'Brussels', 'Lisbon', 'Lisbon']"

Editorial
Diplomacy 101
We were thrilled when President Obama decided to plunge fully into the Middle East peace effort. He appointed a skilled
special envoy, George Mitchell, and demanded that Israel freeze settlements, Palestinians crack down on anti-Israel
violence and Arab leaders demonstrate their readiness to reach out to Israel.
Nine months later, the president's promising peace initiative has unraveled.
The Israelis have refused to stop ail building. The Palestinians say that they won't talk to the Israelis until they do, and
President Mahmoud Abbas is so despondent he has threatened to quit. Arab states are refusing to do anything.
Mr. Obama's own credibility is so diminished (his approval rating in Israel is 4 percent) that serious negotiations may be
farther off than ever.
Peacemaking takes strategic skill. But we see no sign that President Obama and Mr. Mitchell were thinking more than one
move down the board. The president went public with his demand for a full freeze on settlements before securing Israel's
commitment. And he and his aides apparently had no plan for what they would do if Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
said no.
Most important, they allowed the controversy to obscure the real goal: nudging Israel and the Palestinians into peace
talks. (We don't know exactly what happened but we are told that Mr. Obama relied more on the judgment of his political
advisers — specifically his chief of staff, Rehm Emanuel -- than of his Mideast specialists.)
The idea made sense: have each side do something tangible to prove it was serious about peace and then start
negotiations. But when Mr. Netanyahu refused the total freeze, President Obama backed down.
Mr. Netanyahu has since offered a compromise 10-month freeze that exempts Jerusalem, schools and synagogues and
permits Israel to complete 3,000 housing units already under construction. The irony is that while this offer goes beyond
what past Israeli governments accepted, Mr. Obama had called for more. And the Palestinians promptly rejected the
compromise.
Washington isn't the only one to blow it. After pushing President Obama to lead the peace effort, Arab states, especially
Saudi Arabia, refused to make any concessions until settlements were halted. Mr. Mitchell was asking them to allow Israel
to fly commercial planes through Arab airspace or open a trade office. They have also done far too little to strengthen Mr.
Abbas, who is a weak leader but is still the best hope for negotiating a peace deal. Ditto for Washington and Israel.
All this raises two questions: What has President Obama learned from the experience so he can improve his diplomatic
performance generally? And does he plan to revive the peace talks?
The president has no choice but to keep trying. At some point extremists will try to provoke another war. and the absence
of a dialogue will only make things worse. Advancing his own final-status plan for a two-state solution is one high-risk way
forward that we think is worth the gamble. Stalemate is unsustainable.","['Middle', 'East', 'Israel', 'Israel', 'Israel', 'Israel', 'Mideast', 'Jerusalem', 'Israel', 'Washington', 'Saudi', 'Arabia', 'Israel', 'Washington', 'Israel']"

Background: S/E Mitchell met with Foreign Minister Aboul Gheit and EGIS Chief Omar Solimon on January 24 in Cairo.
While Solimon responded positively to S/E Mitchell's request that Egypt encourage Palestinian President Abbas to agree
to proximity talks, Aboul Gheit asserted that the Palestinians should not agree to any form of negotiations until Israel
has taken action on the ""five steps"" requested by the Palestinians. Aboul Gheit then hosted a meeting on February 3
with Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat and Jordanian FM Nasser Judeh, which Solimon attended in part. Egypt and
Jordan agreed to support the Palestinians entry into proximity talks, but the three sides also agreed that Abbas would
seek U.S. views on two questions: 1) The terms of reference for the proximity talks and 2) Whether the U.S. would
present its own bridging proposals on final status issues or simply serve as a conduit for the parties' positions. Deputy
Envoy David Hale met with Abbas on February 5, during which Abbas indicated flexibility on both the terms of reference
(he would accept a general formula based on language from the Roadmap) and on the U.S. role. You should emphasize
that it is critical that Abbas agree to begin proximity talks immediately to lay the foundation for negotiations that will
realize Palestinian aspirations for an independent and viable state.","['Cairo', 'Egypt', 'Israel', 'Egypt', 'Jordan', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'U.S.']"

A Last-Minute Meeting On Afghanistan
President Obama convened a last-minute meeting of his national security team tonight to discuss the language that his
administration will use to describe its new strategy for Afghanistan. Two administration sources confirmed that the
meeting, which began at 5:oo pm, included cabinet officials like Defense Secretary Robert Gates. The officials would not
describe the meeting and said that no other news organizations were being given any background briefing. That suggests
that the meeting was akin to a pre-game rally session by the commander-in-chief: he wants to gert everyone from Gates to
Gen. Stanley McChrystal to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on the same page before the president's Tuesday speech.
Before young officers at West Point, Obama will announce his decision about Afghanistan to an increasingly skeptical
nation and a Democratic Congress that is threatening to condition its budgeting on identifiable off-ramps and
timeframes. Obama is expected to announce that he'll order several Army combat brigades to Afghanistan -- about
30,00o troops in all, most of them to be tasked with more rapidly standing up Afghanistan's indigenous army. His speech,
as described in broad terms by advisers last week, will be short and serious. His challenge is to persuade Americans that
the war in Afghanistan is winnable, as Americans tend to give their presidents significant leeway so long as they believe
that the president is confident in his strategy. Officials said last week that while would outline a clear exit strategy, he
would not tie troop withdrawals to any specific political developments in Afghanistan, which might run into opposition
from Democrats in Congress, who are demanding benchmarks. Nor is the President likely to impose direct conditions on
Afghanistan President Hamid Karzai. An official said that Obama plans to try explain the interconnection between the the
stability of Pakistan and the nexus of terror in Afghanistan. An explanation that the American people would accept has
proven elusive.

The First Lady, her young lover, and a scandal
that could hand power to Sinn Fein
David McKittrick reports on the far-reaching consequences of
Iris Robinson's infidelity
The mesmerising saga of the toyboy, the Northern Ireland First Minister and his straying wife threatened to engulf
Belfast's frail political settlement last night.
Following a day closeted with advisers Peter Robinson, head of the Northern Ireland government, broke his silence to
insist defiantly that he would not step down after a day of turmoil. His move is unlikely to stem the clamour for an inquiry
into an affair which has fused the political and the sexual. First indications are that members of his party, the Democratic
Unionists (DUP), are reacting to the disclosures with strong disapproval. The party is highly religious and lays heavy
emphasis on Christian family values. It is also currently highly nervous that the revelations could cost it seats in the
coming Westminster election. If the DUP were to fracture as a result of the scandal it could lead the way to Sinn Fein
becoming the largest party in the Northern Ireland Assembly - allowing it to nominate its own first minister and putting the
peace process in jeopardy.
Disclosures in a BBC television programme on the activities of his wife, Iris, who has exited from public life, led to a day-
long flurry of political calls for inquiries into the Robinson family.
Mr Robinson stands accused of failing to notify the authorities that his wife had been involved in financial transactions
without declaring an interest. She helped a 19-year-old ""toyboy"" lover to set up a business.
Mr Robinson said he had asked for the appointment of a senior counsel ""to ask me any questions he or she wishes to
ask, and to give an opinion as to what I should have disclosed or whether I have breached an obligation"".
Insisting he had done nothing wrong, Mr Robinson accused the BBC of broadcasting ""smears and innuendo"". Saying that
he did not rule out a defamation action, he declared: ""I am being tried in the court of public opinion.""
Sinn Fein's Martin McGuinness, who is Deputy First Minister, said he was shocked at the BBC revelations and is seeking
talks with both Mr Robinson and Gordon Brown. Mr McGuinness was publicly sympathetic when news of the scandal
broke, but his veering towards a tougher line is taken as indicating a calculation that Mr Robinson may not survive the
storm.
Mr Robinson, who has been First Minister for 18 months, is regarded as a pivotal figure in the peace process since he
was prepared to follow the Rev Ian Paisley into government with Sinn Fein.
But the state of the political settlement has appeared increasingly rocky as Mr Robinson has resisted pressure from
almost all points of the political compass to complete devolution by accepting a transfer of responsibility for policing from
London to Belfast.
His reluctance to move on the policing issue was attributed to nervousness about challenges from hardline opponents in
the Westminster general election. Now opponents are speculating that it might instead have at least partly been due to the
family scandal which has just become public but which he knew of for months.
In recent days Mrs Robinson dramatically announced that she was leaving politics. She is currently Westminster MP for
east Belfast, a councillor and a member of the Belfast Assembly. Yesterday there were calls for her to depart immediately
and stop drawing her salaries.
These reflected the fact that, while her husband might have a faint chance of political survival, her behaviour is regarded
as inexcusable.
She had been a friend of Kirk McCambley's father, Billy. Before he died, he asked Mrs Robinson to look after his son. The
BBC programme, Spotlight, revealed that her relationship with Kirk had developed into a sexual one. It said she
suggested to him that he go into a business venture which was partly organised by Castlereagh council, where she is an
alderman.
She is said to have obtained £50,000 from two property developers, to be used to set up the business. She is also said to
have helped approve the McCambley proposal without declaring a financial interest. The council said yesterday it was
investigating.
The young man was interviewed for the programme. So too was Mrs Robinson's one-time political adviser Selwyn Black,
a former Methodist minister, who gave the BBC access to 150 text messages allegedly sent to him by Mrs Robinson.
Among those calling for a public inquiry yesterday were Jim Allister of Traditional Unionist Voice, a hardline critic of Mr
Robinson. He said the issues in the programme must be addressed ""with utter transparency and candour"".
Ulster Unionist leader Sir Reg Empey called for Mrs Robinson's immediate resignation, saying: ""It is clear that Iris
Robinson's continuing position as an MP, Assembly member and councillor is utterly untenable. She should resign all her
positions with immediate effect.""
He added: ""It is also unfortunately the case that the office of the First Minister is embroiled in these matters. My party will
study the events outlined by the BBC and the very serious allegations that have been made with regards to the conduct of
the First Minister. Inevitably the appropriate authorities will be required to investigate the allegations made against the
First Minister.""
* Northern Ireland Secretary Shaun Woodward refused to speculate about Mr Robinson's future.
But he said: ""It is a responsibility on everyone in the Assembly to understand that the consequences of allowing the
political process to slide would undoubtedly have an impact on the broader canvas.
""And that if anybody were to be selfish enough to think this is a moment when that can be allowed to be put in the deep
freeze, even some may wish to unpick, they would be extremely irresponsible, foolish and would be playing very, very
dangerous games.""
Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Woodward said that the First Minister had to be allowed the opportunity
to clear his name.
But he went on: ""I'm very conscious of the fact that while all that is happening, he is First Minister and the business of
devolution, the business of the Executive must go on.
""I hope he will be able to resume the responsibilities as First Minister to ensure that the work of the Executive continues
and that includes the talks on policing and justice devolution."" PA","['Northern', 'Ireland', 'Belfast', 'Northern', 'Ireland', 'Northern', 'Ireland', 'Assembly', 'London', 'Belfast', 'Belfast', 'Castlereagh', 'Northern', 'Ireland']"

Fear of the poor is hampering Haiti rescue
American views rule among the rubble of Port-au-Prince.
That's one reason aid is taking so long to get to those in need
Linda Polman
Aid workers have already baptised the earthquake in Haiti a ""historical disaster"". It will rate high in the annals of the
humanitarian aid world because of the number of victims and scale of the destruction. But the rescue operation is also
becoming notorious for the slowness with which aid is reaching the victims. Five days after the quake hit, many places are
still largely bereft of international aid.
Not through lack of funds, supplies or emergency experts. Those are all pouring in from dozens of countries. But most of
the aid — and aid workers — seems stuck at the airport.
Rescue teams have pulled survivors from five-star hotels, university buildings, a supermarket and the UN headquarters,
all in Port-au-Prince's better neighbourhoods. In poor areas, where the damage appears much greater, apparently
forgotten victims report on Twitter that they have yet to encounter the first foreign rescuer.
Many aid workers are reported to have orders not to venture out without armed guards — which are not there at all, or
only after long debates with the UN military command. The UN has lost a number of staff in the quake, and is not keen to
risk more lives.
But the Haitian people seem to scare aid workers more than Somali warlords, Darfuri Janjawid or Afghan Taleban.
Frightened Dutch aid workers abandoned a mission without•reaching the collapsed building where people were trapped,
and frightened doctors have left their patients unattended.
The experience of CNN's medical reporter, Dr Sanjay Gupta, is telling. In a makeshift clinic he encountered a Belgian
medical team being evacuated in a UN bus. UN ""rules of engagement"" apparently stopped them providing security for the
doctors. The Belgians took most of their medical supplies with them, to keep them out of the claws of robbers.
Dr Gupta and his camera team stayed the night, monitored the abandoned patients' vital signs and continued intravenous
drips — and they were not robbed. Some rescuers are leaning so much toward security that they will allow people to die.
The media are not helping. CNN rules in the rubble. ""Outside of a military conflict, this is our biggest international
deployment since the tsunami in 2004,"" according to Tony Maddox, the managing director of CNN International. So the
image of the aid operation being beamed back is primarily Ameridan — and one of the big problems is the American view
of Haiti.
CNN won't stop telling aid workers and the outside world about pillaging (the incidence of which — for the first four
frustrating days at least — did not compare with what happened after Hurricane Katrina) and about how dangerous it is to
distribute food, because of the likelihood of ""stampedes"".
Nor is the US Government, the biggest player in the aid operation, doing anything to help to relax the atmosphere. On the
contrary. When President Obama said that the US aid effort would be ""aggressive"" he meant it. The humanitarian
operation is not led by civilian agencies, but by the Pentagon.
Mr Obama ordered 9,000 troops and a fleet of nuclear-powered ships to move in. Victims of the war in Congo (which has
cost five million lives in the past years) and of the genocide in Darfur would love so much American attention — but it is
Haiti's fate to lay in America's backyard and to have been a sore to American eyes for decades already.
One, perhaps even two million Haitians already live in the United States, but more try to come. Every day dead Haitian
refugees wash up on Miami's sunny beaches. Haiti is a constant pain for US taxpayers who feel that the billions of dollars
that have been poured in should have at least lifted the country out of its position as one of the poorest places on Earth.
Even when the earthquake struck, investigations were taking place into the fate of several million dollars of aid funds, sent
to victims of a hurricane that hit Haiti in 2008, that have disappeared.
Furthermore, to the horror of many godfearing Americans, voodoo is an officially recognised religion in Haiti. And, perhaps
above all, Haitians are poor and black. In the view of some Americans those two add up to ... murderous gangs.
The invasion of soldiers and humanitarian workers at the airport of Port-au-Prince reminds me of the American military
invasion of Haiti authorised by President Clinton in 1994. I'd lived and worked there for almost two years as a
correspondent for Dutch radio. There were 20,000 soldiers but they were surprisingly nervous about what reception the
unarmed Haitians might have in store for them.
It turned out to be a wave of slum dwellers streaming to the air and sea port to greet the American guests. In abundant
conga lines they snaked through the city, tea cosies on their heads to express just how happy they were. ""Liberte! Merci
Beel Cling Dong!"" they shouted. A terrified American GI, still a teenager, saw the mass of pitiful creatures approaching
him, and asked me if the tea cosies were ""some kinda voodoo?"". He calmed down only when a line of BMWs and
Mitsubishis appeared and filed past to watch the invasion.
Where the soldier came from, the owners of vehicles like these are respectable citizens. In Haiti, they are likely to be the
ones smuggling drugs and making US aid dollars disappear. The good guys in Haiti are the defenceless people in the
slums. For Western city dwellers, this is the world turned upside down. ""Back! Back!"" the soldier shouted, aiming his
weapons at the good guys.
The rescue teams that stay put at the airport are one reason why we still don't really know what is going on. Seventy
survivors had been pulled from the rubble so far, the International Red Cross said on Sunday. That's 14 rescues per day
as a joint result of the 1,739 international specialised rescue workers that are there. That number would surely jump if
some of the professional equipment that they brought was made available to the countless groups of local people
desperately digging for victims with their bare hands, day and night.
Let's hope that the food distributors worrying about their safety know that yesterday hundreds of people in Port-au-Prince
dropped to their knees praying outside a warehouse where workers for the agency Food for the Poor had announced that
they would be distributing rice and beans. The crowd allowed children and the elderly to go first in line without having
guns aimed at them first.

fyi: Blair's chances seem to be cratering in EU. Sid
Tony lair's bid for EU residency sinks
Ex-PM's chances of winning role slide as Sarkozy and Merkel fail to back him
• Nicholas s‘tv'at.i. and )an,..Trajf.pf in Brussels
• u!,-„ Thursday 29 October 2009 21.26 GMT
T20.,.:31::.3.1:7's hopes of becoming Europe's first sitting president were receding fast tonight as Britain admitted his chances
of success were ""fading"" after the continent's centre-right leaders made it clear one of their own must have the post.
Hours after G
.nr.4,
,efl Srov.,,h delivered his strongest statement of support for Blair — disclosing that he had spoken to him
earl;er this week — British sources indicated that the former prime minister was unlikely to assume the high-profile. job.
""it would be right to describe Tony's c,hances as fading,"" one British source said.""..slcgles. t.
..aa'r.sa; and are
not terribly enthusiastic. Silvio Berlust.-,oni remains his strongest backer.""
Bialr's expected failure to secure the post of president of the European Council meant that ca,•,-,'et.,
..""it;ity.n-te was emerging
as a serious contender to assume the new post of high representative for foreign policy. The foreign secretary insisted,
however, that.he was ""not available"".
Miliband spoke out as British sources said it had become clear in recent days that Blair would struggle to become
president. The post is likely to be filled in the next month amid signs that the Czech Republic will become the last EU
country to ratify the Lisbon treaty.
Sarkozy, the French president, and Merkel, the German chancellor, are understood to have agreed at a dinner at the
Elysee Palace last night that the new president should be appointed from the main centre-right EPP grouping, which
brings together the parties currently ruling most EU countries.
Brown gave a hint at a press conference that Blair's candidacy was fading when he qualified his strong backing for his
predecessor by stating that there were also other candidates for the job. ""Of course it may not happen and there are other
candidates as well,"" he said.
The prime minister's remarks came after he attended an acrimonious meeting of the European centre-left leaders this
afternoon, shortly before the EU summit in Brussels began.
Brown was understood to have had a tense exchange with Martin Schulz, the German leader of the Socialists in the
European parliament, who wants the left to assume the new foreign policy post, leaving the presidency to the centre right.
Brown told the meeting: ""You need to get real. This is a unique opportunity to get a progressive politician to be the
president of the council.""
But it soon became clear that Blair has no support on the left, let alone on the centre right. Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero,
Spain's centre-left prime minister, for the first time publicly queried the Blair candidacy by announcing that the centre left
across the EU was more concerned with securing the other post of European foreign minister. Zapatero, who will have to
work with the new European figureheads when Spain assumes the Eti's six-month rotating presidency on 1 January, said
the European socialists were clear that they want the post of the high representative. ""There is a preference for the high
representative,"" he said. ""That is rather reasonable.""
A senior Spanish official said this was the first time that Zapatero had ""dropped Blair"" and that the centre-left in the EU
was seeking a deal with the centre-right, led by Merkel. The centre-right would get the job coveted by Blair, while the
centre left would take the foreign minister post. The lack of support for Blair became clear when Jean Asselborn,
Luxembourg's foreign minister, launched a strong attack on him as be emerged from the meeting of Socialist leaders. ""lt is
not about the person of Tony Blair. Now in the United States, Obama is the president, it is no more Mr Bush. We have a
new treaty, we have to reset Europe and we need to start with some new ideas. There is and will remain a link for the next
generation between Iraq, Bush and Tony Blair.""
Downing Street wiil resist criticism that it was wrong to mount such a strong campaign in favour of Blair when it had
become clear earlier this week that his chances were fading.
Brown believes it was right — and in the national interest — to argue strongly for Blair when there was a chance to secure
such a senior post for Britain. Blair, who had a tense relationship with Brown during his decade as prime minister, will be
pleased by the strength of his successor's support.
Brown said today: ""Let me say very clear that we, the British government, believe that Tony Blair would be an excellent
candidate and an excellent person to hold the job of president of the council.
""His international experience is well known, his expertise on environmental, economic and security issues is well known to
everybody throughout Europe as well as known throughout the world If you have the chance for that to happen it is in
Britain's national interest.""

4223,"Editorial: Mrs. Clinton in Pakistan
NEW YORK TIMES
October 30, 2009
Hillary Rodham Clinton's first trip to Pakistan as secretary of state was never going to be easy. The day she arrived,
extremists detonated a car bomb at a crowded market in Peshawar that killed at least 100 people. The Nation
newspaper dismissed the visit as a mere ""PR exercise, but who will buy what the US is selling is difficult to imagine,
beyond the already compliant government.""
Polls show that an overwhelming majority of Pakistanis dislike and mistrust the United States. They blame Washington
for using and then abandoning them after the Soviets were driven from Afghanistan. And they resent Washington for
pressing their government now to fight against extremists — and suspect that they will be abandoned again. The fact
that many of the extremists are on Pakistan's territory and threatening Pakistan's government has not shifted that
thinking or mitigated that resentment.
A good part of this, of course, is the failure of Pakistan's government, which has still not adequately explained that this is
not just America's fight. But the United States is also to blame. For eight years the Bush administration coddled the
Pakistani Army at the expense of the rest of society.
Mrs. Clinton challenged Pakistan's government to do more to shut down Al Qaeda, but she was, rightly, determined to
use this visit to also broaden the relationship.
Instead of just courting President Asif All Zardari and the army chief, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, Mrs. Clinton also held
talks with the top opposition leader, Nawaz Sharif; parried questions from an audience of deeply suspicious college
students; met with civil society leaders, including women and Pashtun elders; gave interviews to Pakistani journalists;
and visited religious and cultural sights.
She promised to refocus American aid on the ""needs of the people"" and announced targeted commitments, including
$85 million for microloans for poor women to start businesses and $125 million for the first phase of an electricity
project aimed at reducing blackouts and improving energy conservation.
Those grants are welcome but still small change when compared with a five-year, $7.5 billion — nonmilitary — aid
package approved by Congress and signed into law this year. That package was supposed to demonstrate to Pakistanis
that, this time, the United States is in it for the long haul. Instead, it has become another focus of popular resentment.
The Army and some Pakistani news media whipped that up with disingenuous complaints that the legislation (Islamabad
was consulted beforehand) compromised Pakistan's sovereignty by conditioning disbursement on adequate civilian
control of the military.
If Washington is ever to enlist Pakistan as a reliable ally, it is going to have to do a much better job of explaining itself.
And it is going to have to insist that Pakistan's leaders start explaining the real stakes to their citizens and the real
benefits of an alliance with the United States. Mrs. Clinton's trip was an important start — but only a start.","['Pakistan', 'NEW', 'YORK', 'Pakistan', 'Peshawar', 'US', 'United', 'States', 'Washington', 'Afghanistan', 'Washington', 'Pakistan', 'Pakistan', 'Pakistan', 'America', 'United', 'States', 'Pakistan', 'United', 'States', 'Islamabad', 'Pakistan', 'Washington', 'Pakistan', 'Pakistan', 'United', 'States']"

Wed., Palau was one of only two UN General Assembly members to vote with the U.S against a
resolution calling for an end to the US embargo of Cuba (Israel was the other). Even the two
other states in free association with the US. did not support the US position. important officials
in Palau wanted to abstain because of the drastic cut in.U.S. assistance that Alcy Frelick has
insisted on but Pres. Toribiong decided to stick with the US. The proposal to cut the small
amount of assistance that Palau is receiving is ironic in light of the substantial increase in
assistance pledged to the two other freely associated states just a few years ago. It is also

Gordon Brown on course to win election
David Smith and Jonathan Oliver
GORDON BROWN is on course to remain prime minister after the general election as a new Sunday Times poll reveals
that Labour is now just two points behind the Tories.
The YouGov survey places David Cameron's Conservatives on 37%, as against 35% for Labour — the closest gap
between the parties in more than two years.
It means Labour is heading for a total of 317 seats, nine short of an overall majority, with the Tories languishing on a total
of just 263 MPs. Such an outcome would mean Brown could stay in office and deny Cameron the keys to No 10.
The poll result presents the Conservative leader with one of the greatest challenges of his leadership today as he makes
the keynote speech to his party's spring forum.
In an interview with The Sunday Times, Cameron defied his right-wing critics who believe the party's modernisation has
gone too far. He said: ""Some people say to me, 'Play things safe; try to win by default — the government is in a mess.' I
say, 'No. This is the Conservative party that is offering radical change. I'm doubling up on change'.""
With the expected May 6 election now just over two months away, Cameron will seek to reconnect with voters through a
series of pledges, including a plan to restore discipline in schools. In an echo of the speech that won him the Tory
leadership in 2005, he will address the Brighton conference without notes.
""This is very, very clear,"" he said. ""I've made my choice. There is no going back. This election is about change and we will
be offering change.""
Cameron insisted he was unconcerned about the collapse in Tory support. ""The polls move around a lot,"" he said. ""The
voters tell us that they want change. They want to know the Conservative party itself has changed.""
The narrowing of the Conservative lead has been dramatic and rapid. Until January the Tories held close to a 10-point
lead. But a week ago a Sunday Times YouGov poll put the gap at six points, suggesting a hung parliament, with the
Tories still on course to become the largest party.
In the last election, in 2005, support for the parties generally held steady in the run-up to polling day. YouGov polling for
The Sunday Times showed Labour leads of between two and five points from January through to the June election.
Labour's margin of victory was three points.
In today's poll, Labour has risen two points on the previous week, from 33%, while the Conservatives have dropped two
from 39%. The Liberal Democrats are unchanged on 17%.
The collapse in the Tory poll lead will put pressure on the pound in financial markets tomorrow by adding to fears that a
hung parliament will mean insufficient action is taken to cut Britain's budget deficit.
The last time the gap between the two main parties came this close and the Tory support was so low was in autumn 2007.
That was before Brown's honeymoon ended with his failure to call a snap general election. The Conservatives went on to
peak in May 2008 with a 26-point lead.
Today's poll suggests recent claims about Brown's tantrums and his intimidation of staff may have actually helped him.
Just 28% of people believe the prime minister is a bully and 50% agree he has a ""strong sense of right and wrong"".
The survey disclosed growing concerns about Cameron's elite background and lack of empathy with ordinary families.
Just 25% think that Cameron understands problems faced by ""people like me"", compared with 35% for Brown.","['Brighton', 'Britain']"

The survey disclosed growing concerns about Cameron's elite background and lack of empathy with ordinary families.
Just 25% think that Cameron understands problems faced by ""people like me"", compared with 35% for Brown.
Furthermore, only 28% think the Conservative leader wants to do the best for ""all groups in Britain"", against 39% for the
prime minister.
Peter Kellner, president of YouGov, the Sunday Times pollster, said that while individual polls could throw up unexpected
shifts, the recent trend had been for a significant narrowing of the Tory lead.
""Our daily polls should be regarded a bit like the FTSE index: a 100-point rise or fall in a day might be a blip or a trend —
often we can't tell for a few days,"" he said.
""I am confident the Tory lead is down this weekend but I can't promise whether the latest movement will be sustained,
increased or reversed in the days ahead. One of the reasons for doing daily polls is to monitor these fluctuations.""
The Tory lead of 6%, which was first reported in The Sunday Times, was maintained in YouGov's polls in The Sun last
week. The increase in support for Labour on Thursday and Friday, as the latest Sunday Times poll was being conducted,
came as figures showed a strengthening economic recovery.
Under the British parliamentary system, the prime minister remains in office after a general election until he either tenders
his resignation or is defeated in a Commons no confidence vote.
If the election result leaves Labour just short of an overall majority, Brown is likely to battle on, with Labour running the
country as a minority government. The party would seek to do deals with minor parties such as Ulster's Democratic
Unionist party or, if necessary, Nick Clegg's Liberal Democrats, to get its legislation through parliament.
If repeated in a general election on the basis of a uniform swing in all constituencies, today's poll would leave Labour just
nine seats short of the 326 needed for an overall majority in the new 650-seat House of Commons.
The Tories would be well behind on 263 seats, with the Liberal Democrats on 41. Kellner calculated that, even allowing for
a larger swing to the Tories in marginal seats, where the party has spent millions of pounds on campaigning, the poll was
consistent with Labour being by far the largest party.
He suggested that in such a scenario Labour might win 300 seats, with the Tories on 270 and the Lib Dems on 50.
Labour will believe it is benefiting from the upturn in the economy. For the first time in a YouGov poll since July 2007,
before the financial crisis, people trust Labour more than the Tories to run the economy.
YouGov, which began polling after the 2001 election, has developed a reputation for accuracy. Its final Sunday Times poll
in 2005 was precisely right, and it accurately predicted Boris Johnson's victory in the 2008 London mayoral election and
the results of last year's Euro elections.

Senate Race Competitive
Raleigh, N.C. — The race to replace Ted Kennedy in the US Senate is looking like a toss
up, with Republican Scott Brown up 48-47 on Martha Coakley.
Brown is benefiting from depressed Democratic interest in the election and a huge lead
among independents for his surprisingly strong standing. Those planning to vote in the
special election only report having voted for Barack Obama in 2008 by a 16 point
margin, in contrast to his actual 26 point victory in the state.
That decline in turnout from Obama voters plagued Democratic candidates for Governor
in Virginia and New Jersey last fall. Beyond that 66% of Republicans say they're 'very
excited' about turning out while only 48% of Democrats express that sentiment.
Brown leads 63-31 with independents and is winning 17% of the Democratic vote while
Coakley receives only 6% support from GOP voters. Both candidates are relatively
popular, with 57% viewing Brown favorably to only 25% unfavorable and 50% with a
positive opinion of Coakley to 42% negative.
Those folks planning to vote in the special election are actually opposed to Obama's
health care plan by a 47/41 margin and only narrowly express approval of the President's
overall job performance 44/43.
""The Massachusetts Senate race is shaping up as a potential disaster for Democrats,"" said
Dean Debnam, President of Public Policy Polling. ""Martha Coakley's complacent
campaign has put Scott Brown in a surprisingly strong position and she will need to step
it up in the final week to win a victory once thought inevitable.""
PPP surveyed 744 likely Massachusetts voters from January 7th to 9th. The margin of
error is +/-3.6%. Other factors, such as refusal to be interviewed and weighting, may
introduce additional error that is more difficult to quantify.

Obama's Approval Rating Dips to New Low
(CBS)
President Obama's job approval rating has fallen to 46 percent, according to a new CBS News poll.
That rating is Mr. Obama's lowest yet in CBS News polling, and the poll marks the first time his approval rating has fallen
below the 50 percent mark. Forty-one percent now say they disapprove of Mr. Obama's performance as president.
In last month's CBS News poll, 50 percent of Americans approved of how the president was handling his job, while thirty-
nine percent disapproved.
Analysis: The Irony Behind Obama's Poll Numbers
Mr. Obama still receives strong support from Democrats (eight in ten approve of his performance), but his approval rating
among Republicans is only 13 percent. More importantly, Mr. Obama's approval rating among independents has declined
10 points in recent months — and it now stands at just 42 percent.
Domestic issues — and not his response to terrorist threats - appear to be driving the president's approval rating
downward.
Just 41 percent now approve of his handling of the economy, which Americans say is the nation's most pressing issue.
Forty-seven percent disapprove. The president's marks on handling health care, with reforms still under debate in
Congress, are even lower — just 36 percent approve, while 54 percent disapprove. Both of these approval ratings are the
lowest of Mr. Obama's presidency.
Meanwhile, both parties in Congress receive even lower marks than the president on handling health care. Few
Americans think the reforms in Congress hit the right note on expanding coverage, lowering costs and regulating the
health insurance industry. (Read more on the health care poll results)
(CBS)
The president receives slightly higher ratings for his handling of the war in Afghanistan and the threat of terrorism than on
domestic issues. Forty-six percent approve of Mr. Obama's handling of Afghanistan, and 52 percent approve of how he is
handling the threat of terrorism.
While some Republicans have criticized the president and Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano's responses
to the attempted Christmas Day terror attack, most Americans don't share their opinion.
In the poll, 57 percent of Americans approve of the way the Obama administration has responded to the attempted attack,
and 29 percent disapprove. Views are highly partisan — 75 percent of Democrats approve, while just 41 percent of
Republicans and 55 percent of independents do.
More Findings from the Poll:
•Fear of another terrorist attack has increased since the attempted attack on a Northwest Airlines flight from Amsterdam
on Christmas Day. Now, 26 percent think another attack on the United States within the next few months is very likely, up
from 12 percent just before the latest incident. This is the highest percentage that has felt an attack was very likely since
March 2003, just after the U.S. invasion of Iraq.
•While most Americans (56 percent) have at least a fair amount of confidence that the government will protect its citizens
from future attacks, just 15 percent are very confident. In the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, more expressed confidence.
•Few Americans —just 19 percent - think U.S. intelligence agencies are doing all they could to monitor the actions of
suspected terrorists. Seventy-six think they could be doing more.
•Most Americans support conducting full body scans on travelers using a digital x-ray machine, a device some airports
are now using. Seventy-four percent agree these machines should be used because they provide a detailed check for
hidden weapons and explosives and reduce the need for physical searches. Just 20 percent think these machines should
not be used because they would produce an image of a passenger's naked body and are an invasion of privacy.
•Over half of Americans think the U.S. should continue to keep the Guantanamo Bay prison open. Thirty-two percent
think it ought to be closed and the prisoners there transferred somewhere else.
•The American public continues to volunteer the economy and jobs as the most important problem facing the country (44
percent), with health care a distant second (14 percent). In the wake of the attempted terror attack on Christmas Day, the
percentage that cites terrorism as the most pressing issue has risen to seven percent from zero percent early last month.
•The public's overall assessment of the condition of the national economy remains grim — 82 percent of Americans say
the economy is in bad shape. Looking ahead, 31 percent of Americans think the economy is getting better, while 19
percent think it is getting worse. Forty-nine percent now say the economy is staying the same.","['China', 'Afghanistan', 'Afghanistan', 'Amsterdam', 'United', 'States', 'U.S.', 'Iraq', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'Guantanamo', 'Bay']"

Inside the Reid eruption
By Mike Allen & Glenn Thrush I 1/12/10 @ 12:19 AM EST
Harry Reid isn't talkative. But the Senate majority leader chatted freely with the two disarmingly charming book authors
who came to his office at the Capitol shortly after the 2008 election.
They — and their tape recorder — were soaking in his reminiscences about the wild campaign that had turned a
backbencher in his caucus into president of the United States.
Reid wasn't on guard — perhaps because he'd been told by his staff that the meeting would be ""off the record,""
according to a person with knowledge of the exchange.
Although Reid is a master of the Senate's mysterious inside game, he's often botched the outside game because of what
one colleague calls a ""penchant for saying things without a filter.""
But Jim Manley, Reid's senior communications adviser, wasn't too worried as he and his boss sat down with John
Heilemann of New York Magazine and Mark Halperin of Time magazine — two veteran reporters who were working on
what their publisher had billed as ""a sweeping, novelistic, and ultimately definitive portrait"" of the 2008 race.
Like virtually every Washington political insider, Manley had a long and warm relationship with Halperin, the longtime
political director for ABC News who once set conventional wisdom in Washington with ""The Note.""
Maybe Reid and Manley — thinking back to their many candid exchanges over the years — simply assumed that
Halperin wouldn't burn him or his boss. Or maybe he expected that Halperin would check back with him on any quotes
he planned to use?
Whatever they were thinking, they were wrong.
Reid was talking about the reasons why, even though he had publicly professed neutrality in the vicious Democratic
primaries of 2008, he had secretly encouraged then-Illinois Sen. Barack Obama to challenge another member of his
caucus, then-New York Sen. Hillary Clinton. And amid all the talk of Obama's oratorical gifts, he let slip something else:
Obama could win the White House because he was a ""light-skinned"" African-American ""with no Negro dialect, unless he
wanted to have one.""
The authors write in ""Game Change,"" published this weekend, that Reid had made the remark ""privately."" They did not
say he had said it to them.
As a chagrined Reid telephoned political allies in the Senate and civil rights community to shore up his support this
weekend, he made it clear that he felt burned by the authors.
In the book's""Authors' Note,"" they wrote: ""All of our interviews — from those with junior staffers to those with the
candidates themselves — were conducted on a 'deep background' basis, which means we agreed not to identify the
subjects as sources in any way. We believed this was essential to eliciting the level of candor on which a book of this sort
depends.""
Heilemann said on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe"": ""We had a very clear agreement with all those sources that our interviews
would be on deep background.... Our ground rules are ... that we won't identify any of our sources as the sources of the
material. But we said to them all very clearly that if they put themselves in scenes of the book, if they were uttering
dialogue to people in the book in part of a scene, that we would identify them as the utterer of those words.""
Halperin added: ""There's no one we talked to for the book who we burned in any way, or violated any agreement with.""
Manley, a Capitol Hill veteran who also had worked for the late Sen. Ted Kennedy, had been responsible for monitoring
the interview and dealing with issues arising from it.
But he didn't tell anyone else in Reid's inner circle about the inflammatory remarks their boss had made; because of his
good relationship with the authors, he assumed that the quotes would never be made public — at least not without his
knowing about it first.
Manley declined comment on this story-- and wouldn't confirm if the interview took place.
On Friday at 10 p.m. — half a year after the interview — The Atlantic's Marc Ambinder e-mailed Reid's staff with
questions about a ""light-skinned"" candidate without a ""Negro dialect.""
In the second-guessing that followed, Capitol Hill veterans said there was no way that such inflammatory words from a
Senate majority leader would remain off the record, even if that had been the arrangement.
But because Manley had not sounded an internal alarm, he and the rest of the damage-control squad were caught flat-
footed by Ambinder's e-mail, several people close to the situation told POLITICO.
""They could have had weeks to prepare for this or to try to convince Halperin not to run it,"" said a Democrat who
participated in some of the damage control.
Now the staff had been blindsided with a revelation that, if mishandled, could be politically fatal. Manley and other
aides worked until 2 a.m. Saturday to draft Reid's carefully written apology, which emphasized his record on African-
American issues.
""I deeply regret using such a poor choice of words,"" the 90-word statement began.
Later on Saturday, Manley helped lead a counteroffensive, calling White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, a friend
from his days as communications director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, to set up an apology call
between Reid, at home in Searchlight, Nev., and Obama back in Washington.
In a stunning ""Statement by the President"" e-mailed to reporters at 3:55 p.m. Saturday, Obama said: ""Harry Reid called
me today and apologized for an unfortunate comment reported today.... As far as I'm concerned, the book is closed.""
Relieved to have the president's solid backing, Reid's aides decided that their toughest challenge would be to prevent
any prominent African-American Democrats from attacking Reid too harshly — or calling for his resignation.
Reid's team correctly anticipated that Republicans would demand his head. Keeping that criticism from becoming a
bipartisan drumbeat was the key. The team calculated that as long as the attacks looked like partisan shouting, Reid
would benefit.
Aides say their boss quickly understood the danger and spent much of Saturday working a call list of about 30 prominent
African-Americans across the country. On the calls, he apologized for his words and argued that the book's main
takeaway should be that he had quietly supported Obama over Clinton, long before those made his feelings public.
Among those he called were the Rev. Al Sharpton; longtime civil rights leader Julian Bond; Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.),
chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus; political consultant and talk-show fixture Donna Brazile; House Majority
Whip Jim Clyburn (D-S.C.); Wade Henderson, CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights; and Hilary Shelton,
director of the NAACP's Washington office.
The extent of the damage to his already shaky reelection chances in Nevada won't be known until November. But by
Monday, Reid believed the Washington storm was passing. From his home in New York, Sen. Chuck Schumer telephoned
Reid in Nevada and offered to organize a letter of support from all the Democratic senators.
Reid decided that was unnecessary. He had confidently concluded that for now, at least, he had won the inside game.","['Capitol', 'United', 'States', 'New', 'York', 'Magazine', 'Washington', 'Washington', 'then-New', 'York', 'Capitol', 'Hill', 'Atlantic', 'Nev.', 'Washington', 'Washington', 'Nevada', 'Washington', 'New', 'York', 'Nevada']"

Talks under way for N-deal with US: Haqqani
By Zulciernain Tahir
Monday, 15 Feb, 2010 I 06:02 AM PST I
LAHORE: Pakistan's Ambassador to US Husain Haqqani has said the government has started negotiating with the United
States for an agreement on nuclear technology.
""The US is not sceptical about our nuclear programme. Talks between Pakistan and the US for cooperation on atomic
programmes are under way and we want the US to have an agreement with us like the one it had with India on civil
nuclear technology,"" Mr Haqqani said at a reception hosted by Punjab Governor Salmaan Taseer on Sunday.
He said Pakistan would get 16 latest F-16 aircraft in June. He said although the expectations of Pakistan and the US with
each other usually did not fulfil, both were indispensable for each other.
""We have to largely depend upon the US for our defence related matters.
""India is our main concern as it is buying weapons worth $100 billion from five countries, including China, and to balance
it our relations with the US are very significant,"" he said and added that India had 5,500 tanks and there was a question
against whom they would be used. ""We cannot be assured by statements that India will not wage a war against us.""
Giving a reason as to why Pakistan had to look towards the US for enhancing its military capacity and capability, Mr
Haqqani said the European countries did not offer soft terms for buying weapons. ""Ties with the US are important for a
secure, stable and prosperous Pakistan.""
Mr Haqqani said Pakistan had also made it clear on the US that it should ensure a strengthened and Islamabad-friendly
regime in Kabul before leaving.
He said Pakistan had sought drone technology from America. ""On one hand our innocent people are losing their lives
while on the other Taliban leaders like Baitullah Mehsud get killed in such attacks,"" he said.
Mr Haqqani said the US wanted to strengthen democracy in Pakistan and aid under the Kerry-Lugar Bill had started
coming from January.
In reply to a question, he said Pakistan's embassy in the US was working on diplomatic and legal aspects in Dr Aafia
Siddiqui case and was making efforts for securing her release or transfer of her case to a Pakistani court.

He said the administration had also told Pakistan that ""there is no way they can get a civilian nuclear deal similar to the

4353,"Possibility of Senate Run, Nurtured and Abandoned By MICHAEL BARBARO March 03, 2010 New York Times
A few weeks ago, Harold E. Ford Jr. had a telephone conversation with his friend Doug Band, the powerful counselor to
former President Bill Clinton.
Mr. Ford, the former Tennessee congressman who now works on Wall Street, wanted to discuss a potential challenge to
Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand in New York's Democratic primary, a possibility he had flirted with for weeks.
But Mr. Band was not encouraging. He told Mr. Ford that with Democrats reeling from political setbacks across the
country, it would be bad for the party and his career if he entered the race. ""It's not the right thing to do,"" he said,
according to a person with direct knowledge of the conversation.
A Ford spokesman confirmed the call but denied that Mr. Ford had been discouraged from running or that he had been
told that doing so would hurt the party. The spokesman said Mr. Band told him the White House had pressured Mr.
Clinton into supporting Ms. Gillibrand.
Mr. Ford's decision not to run for the Senate, which he disclosed on Tuesday, came after he reached out to dozens of
donors, advocates and political leaders. In private conversations, the same worries emerged: that a race against Ms.
Gillibrand would be a brutal fight, dominated by endless debates about when he began paying taxes as a New York
resident and the sincerity of his support for gay marriage and abortion rights.
A campaign that he had hoped would focus on tax cuts and job growth would instead, he feared, become mired in
discussions of ""who got there first, and who meant it the most,"" on social issues, he told an associate. That might allow a
Republican opponent to swoop in and take the seat from the bloodied Democratic nominee.
What seemed to weigh on him, interviews with dozens of people who have met and spoken to his advisers revealed,
was not his status as a carpetbagger who had moved to New York from Tennessee, but rather the reality that there were
few easy constituencies for him to grab on to, outside of Wall Street, where he has worked since moving here in 2006.
Many spoke on the condition of anonymity because they did not want to be seen as disclosing private conversations.
As he hopscotched from city to city, charming crowds with bits of his Southern biography, signs of trouble for Mr. Ford
emerged. His voting record in Congress put him on the right fringes of state Democrats, and his $2 million-a-year job at
Merrill Lynch made it hard to run as a Scott Brown-style populist.
What seemed like an improbable, even impossible campaign had its roots in conversations, many dating back a year,
among Mr. Ford, 39, and a coterie of powerful friends from New York City, Washington and Los Angeles.
Over dinner last July at the Post House, a clubby steakhouse on the Upper East Side, Richard Plepler, a co-president of
HBO, urged Mr. Ford to restart his political career in New York. ""I think you should give this serious thought,"" he said, of
the Senate race. Mr. Ford replied that he would.
After the dinner, Mr. Plepler sent an e-mail message to Douglas E. Schoen, a top Democratic pollster, to bounce the idea
off him. Mr. Schoen was intrigued, and as he studied public polls, became convinced that Mr. Ford's best shot at
reaching the Senate was to wage a campaign against Ms. Gillibrand.
Over the next few months, Mr. Ford sounded out many of New York's wealthiest and most politically connected
executives, frequently over breakfast at the Regency Hotel on Park Avenue: Robert Wolf, the head of the United States
investment banking division at UBS; Ronald Perelman, the billionaire chairman of Revlon; and Steven Rattner, the
founder of Quadrangle, the private equity firm, all of whom are big Democratic donors.
Mr. Rattner told Mr. Ford, who is also a political analyst on NBC, that money would not be a problem. ""You can raise the
money,"" he told him in December.
Yet several big-name donors warned him that Ms. Gillibrand, a relentless campaigner, had beaten him to the punch.
""She has already locked a lot of Wall Street up"" was the message that Marc Lasry, a billionaire hedge fund manager,
conveyed to Mr. Ford in a telephone conversation.
As Mr. Ford traveled outside New York City, especially upstate, he found political support for Ms. Gillibrand to be
shallow, and the hunger for change palpable. The mayor of Syracuse, Stephanie Miner, told him that residents there
were ""scared and desperate"" about the economy, and she told Mr. Ford that Ms. Gillibrand was a rare presence in her
city.
But Ms. Gillibrand's strategy of portraying Mr. Ford as a showboating out-of-towner was starting to stick. In late January,
the head of the Brooklyn Democratic Party, Assemblyman Vito J. Lopez, held a luncheon for Mr. Ford, and invited local
lawmakers. During a two-hour question-and-answer session, Marty Markowitz, the borough president, pointed to
several up-and-coming state senators around the room and observed that all of them had greater experience in New
York politics than Mr. Ford.
""With all due respect,"" he asked Mr. Ford, ""why do you think you have what it takes to be New York's senator?""
Even lawmakers who seemed open to a Ford candidacy warned him that peeling away support from Ms. Gillibrand
would be harder than it seemed.
Ruben Diaz Jr., the Bronx borough president, told Mr. Ford between bites of an omelet at a diner near his office, ""It's
difficult to make a strong case against her here."" Ms. Gillibrand, he explained, had just secured $4 million worth of
federal stimulus money to train his constituents for green jobs. Mr. Ford knew that some liberals would attack his
relatively conservative voting record but, those he spoke with said, he was taken aback by the depth of the anger he
encountered from advocates for abortion rights and gay marriage.
After reporters found examples of Mr. Ford calling himself pro-life during his time in Congress, Mr. Ford vehemently
pushed back, saying he had always supported a woman's right to choose. He assumed that would put the matter to rest.
It did not. ""He was dumbfounded that it kept tripping him up,"" a friend said.
One of Mr. Ford's top advisers, Bradley Tusk, the campaign manager for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's 2009 re-election,
arranged a meeting for Mr. Ford with a close Bloomberg ally, Kelli Conlin, the head of Naral-Pro Choice of New York. Mr.
Ford expected a polite conversation that would help neutralize a foe. Ms. Conlin, however, started the meeting by
quizzing Mr. Ford on his voting record and public statements.
Did he realize, she asked, that he had backed legislation that would outlaw late-term abortions even when a woman's
health is in danger?
Far from conciliatory, Mr. Ford wanted to know why Naral allowed Ms. Gillibrand to vote for a health care bill that cut
off financing for abortions. ""You gave her a pass,"" he said. Before leaving, Mr. Ford told Ms. Conlin that if he chose to
run he hoped to return to ask for the group's support. Ms. Conlin responded: ""We can never support you if you take
these positions."" Mr. Ford ""looked shocked,"" a person in the room said.
His meeting with gay rights advocates on Feb. 24 was rockier still. When he walked into the headquarters of the
Stonewall Democrats in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan, he was greeted by signs that read ""Liar!"" and ""Go
home snake oil Harry,"" a reference to his recent support for gay marriage after having twice voted to outlaw it in
Congress.
A few days later, the results of a poll that Mr. Ford had paid for out of his own pocket began to trickle in, giving his
advisers pause. His negative ratings had increased slightly. A liberal primary electorate seemed wary about portions of
his record. Ms. Gillibrand remained vulnerable, the data showed, but Mr. Ford's chance seemed to be 50-50. ""It was not
a slam dunk, at all,"" said a person who spoke with him and was briefed on the data.
Mr. Tusk had told associates that to win, Mr. Ford needed 80 percent of the state's black vote, a tall order, but not
inconceivable for an African-American in a Democratic primary. But by the end of the week, Gov. David A. Paterson and
Representative Charles B. Rangel had become embroiled in ethics scandals. New York's black political elite was in
seeming disarray, just when he needed them to be organized and unified.
By Sunday, he had made up his mind not to run. He told his wife, Emily, and his father, former Representative Harold
Ford Sr. He began to call friends the next evening, leaving many of them brief messages.
""I'm not going to run this time,"" he said in one message. ""Thank you for your support.""","['Tennessee', 'Wall', 'Street', 'New', 'York', 'New', 'York', 'New', 'York', 'Tennessee', 'Wall', 'Street', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Washington', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Upper', 'East', 'Side', 'New', 'York', 'New', 'York', 'Regency', 'Hotel', 'on', 'Park', 'Avenue', 'United', 'States', 'Quadrangle', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Syracuse', 'New', 'York', 'New', 'York', 'Bronx', 'Chelsea', 'Manhattan', 'New', 'York']"

Boehner chief of staff dies at 46
By: Patrick O'Connor
January 10, 2010 01:40 PM EST
Paula Nowakowski, the longtime chief of staff to House Republican Leader John Boehner,
died unexpectedly Saturday night, according to the leader's office. She was 46.
""It is with profound sadness and shock that I announce the passing of Paula Nowakowski,
my longtime chief of staff, trusted aide and friend, who died suddenly last night,"" Boehner
said in a statement early Sunday afternoon. ""Words cannot adequately express the sorrow
and disbelief I and every member of our team are grappling with today in the wake of this
stunning news.""
A Boehner aide said the cause was an apparent heart attack.
President Barack Obama and Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) were among those who
called Boehner Sunday to offer their condolences on Nowakoski's death.
""The entire Capitol Hill community is shocked and saddened by the sudden passing of
Paula Nowakowski,"" Pelosi said in a statement. ""As Chief of Staff to Republican Leader
John Boehner, Paula earned the respect not only of her Leadership and Conference, but
all House Members on both sides of the aisle. She served Leader Boehner both in his
current position as well as previously at the Committee on Education and the Workforce
with great distinction.
""Paula was a thorough professional who loved the House and worked in a constructive
and bipartisan fashion to implement policies to help the Congress function efficiently. On
behalf of the entire House, I express our deep sadness to Paula's family, friends and our
colleague, Leader John Boehner.""
""Paula had some of the finest qualities a public servant can have: she was committed to
advancing the cause of freedom, she cared deeply about the people she served, and she
was a patriot,"" said Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY.).
""On behalf of her senate colleagues, I pass on my condolences to her family, Leader
Boehner and his staff, and the whole House family for this tragic loss of our friend.""
It would be hard to overstate Nowakowski's role in Boehner's tight-knit office. She has
worked for the Ohio Republican almost continuously since 1995, when she joined his staff
as communications director for the Republican Conference.
In the years since, she has worked as staff director for the Education and Labor
Committee and served as his chief of staff since he returned to the leadership in early
2006. She briefly left Boehner's side in 1998 after he lost the conference post following a
tough election for Republicans but rejoined him in 2001 when he assumed the
chairmanship of the Education and Labor Committee.
Along the way, she counseled Boehner on just about every decision he made and often
served as an enforcer of sorts for the collegial Republican leader. It would be hard to find
any chief of staff on Capitol Hill who maintained a closer relationship with her boss than
the one she shared with Boehner.
Aides said Sunday that Boehner's office and extended network of former colleagues,
known to many as ""Boehner-land,"" were collectively shocked by the news.
""We will remember Paula as she would want to be remembered — as a tireless worker,
faithful friend, rabid Detroit sports fan, whip-smart strategist, warrior for freedom and
devoted Catholic who counted President Ronald Reagan and Pope John Paul II among
her greatest heroes. She will never be replaced or forgotten,"" Boehner said. ""I ask for your
prayers for Paula's family.""

Paula Nowakowski, Rep. Boehner's chief of staff, dies at 46
By Martin Weil
Washington Post Staff Writer
Monday, January 11, 2010; B04
Paula Nowakowski, 46, chief of staff for House Minority Leader John A. Boehner, was found dead Jan. 10 at
her home in Alexandria.
No official cause of death was available. Antonia Ferrier, a spokeswoman for Boehner (R-Ohio), said it
appeared that Ms. Nowakowski died of a heart attack.
A longtime Hill aide, and Boehner's staff chief since 2006, Ms. Nowakowski was named by the Capitol Hill
publication Roll Call to its 2009 list of the ""Fabulous Fifty"" staff members. The accolade recognized her savvy,
her clout and her access to the top people in Congress.
Ms. Nowakowski, an avowed conservative, was highly regarded by leaders of both parties.
She was praised by Boehner and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.).
""It is with profound sadness and shock that I announce the passing of Paula Nowakowski, my longtime chief of
staff, trusted aide, and friend, who died suddenly,"" Boehner said in a statement.
""Words cannot adequately express the sorrow and disbelief I and every member of our team are grappling with
today in the wake of this stunning news,"" Boehner said.
Pelosi called Ms. Nowakowski a ""thorough professional who loved the House and worked in a constructive and
bipartisan fashion to implement policies to help the Congress function efficiently.""
According to WhoRunsGov. corn, a Washington Post Co. Web site, Ms. Nowakowski grew up in St. Clair
Shores, Mich., and studied English at Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y.
She told Politico of being made more conservative by the campus ""rise of the loony left,"" citing ""wacky, wacky
stuff,"" which shaped her politics.
According to a reference book on congressional aides, she worked for the Republican National Committee in
the late 1980s and early 1990s, then joined the staff of the House Republican Conference. After two years as a
public affairs vice president of the American Insurance Association, she worked from 2001 to 2006 as staff
director of the House Committee on Education & the Workforce. A Boehner aide said she worked for him at
both the Republican Conference and the Education Committee.
Pelosi's staff chief, John Lawrence, who was Ms. Nowakowski's Democratic counterpart on the education
committee, said they transcended political differences to ""work in a very collegial way to strengthen the House
itself."" He called her ""a great professional.""
After the GOP lost its House majority in 2006 , Ms. Nowakowski said she experienced ""the seven stages of
grief,"" according to the Almanac of the Unelected 2008, a reference on Hill staffers.
""You don't want to be a compliant minority,"" she said of the party's new status, ""but you have to adjust your
expectations.""
In his statement, Boehner called Ms. Nowakowski ""a tireless worker, faithful friend and rabid Detroit sports
fan.
Survivors include her longtime companion, Michael Smith, her mother, a brother and a sister.

The Passing of Victoria DeLong
This morning I spoke with the family of Victoria DeLong, the Cultural Affairs Officer at our Embassy in Port-Au-Prince
who lost her life in the earthquake. I expressed my sincerest condolences on behalf of the men and women of the State
Department and the American people. This is one tragedy among so many. The United Nations has suffered grevious
losses. And the Hatian people have endured unimaginable heartbreak. For the State Department, we have lost one of
our own. Victoria was a veteran Foreign Service Officer who worked tirelessly to build bridges of understanding and
respect between the people of the United State and the people of Haiti. She served her country with distinction and
honor, and she will be sorely missed. Victoria's friends and colleagues at the Embassy are working day and night to
support vital relief and recovery efforts, and our thoughts, our prayers, and our deepest thanks are with them as well.
Along with the military personnel, the search and rescue teams, and all the aid and relief workers now deploying, they
represent the unwavering commitment of the United States to stand with Haiti in its hour of need and in the hard days
and years to come. My heart is with the DeLong family today, and with all those in Haiti and around the world who have
lost loved ones and friends in this disaster.

New blow for Tories as lead slips in marginals
By Nigel Morris and Michael Savage
Poll shows crumbling support in target seats as David
Cameron is drawn into Ashcroft non-dom row
The Conservative lead is crumbling in the crucial marginal seats that David Cameron is relying on to deliver general
election victory for the party, a poll last night disclosed.
The result was a fresh setback for the Tory leader after a torrid day in which he was drawn deeper into the row over the
billionaire peer Lord Ashcroft, when it emerged that he had known for less than a month that Lord Ashcroft had
maintained his non-dom tax status for 10 years.
The chances of the party drawing a line under the controversy were also wrecked by the announcement that Lord
Ashcroft will be summoned to the Commons to explain why he negotiated a secret deal to enter the House of Lords
without paying tax in this country on his overseas fortune.
With Gordon Brown expected to announce the election date this month, senior Tories have put a brave face on their
sliding support in national opinion polls since the turn of the year.
They insisted they were performing much more strongly in marginal constituencies where the drive for votes has been
masterminded and substantially funded by Lord Ashcroft.
The YouGov poll for Channel 4 News found the Tory lead in 60 Labour-held marginals had shrunk from seven to just two
points over the past year.
The slide in Conservative support is further evidence Britain could be heading for a hung parliament after the election
expected on 6 May. The survey put the Tories on 39 per cent (down four points since last year) and Labour on 37 per cent
(up one). YouGov calculated that the results would leave the Tories the largest party after the election, but 11 seats short
of an overall Commons majority.
An investigation by The Independent last week found the Tories spent £6m over two years in the marginal battlegrounds,
in most cases far outspending Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
The party faces the daunting challenge of capturing 117 seats to achieve a majority of just one - a task described by a
shadow cabinet member as a ""mountain to climb"".
The Conservatives received some good news yesterday when an 18-month inquiry by the Electoral Commission
concluded that the £5.1m they received in donations from Bearwood Corporate Services, controlled by Lord Ashcroft,
were legal. The party would have faced having to pay the money back had the electoral watchdog reached the opposite
conclusion.
However, the commission added its regret that the Tories refused to agree to interviews and that Lord Ashcroft had
destroyed documents relating to the ownership of the company.",['Britain']

Op-Ed Columnist
Taking On China
By PAUL KRUGMAN
Tensions are rising over Chinese economic policy, and rightly so: China's policy of keeping its currency, the renminbi,
undervalued has become a significant drag on global economic recovery. Something must be done.
To give you a sense of the problem: Widespread complaints that China was manipulating its currency — selling renminbi
and buying foreign currencies, so as to keep the renminbi weak and China's exports artificially competitive — began
around 2003. At that point China was adding about $10 billion a month to its reserves, and in 2003 it ran an overall
surplus on its current account — a broad measure of the trade balance — of $46 billion.
Today, China is adding more than $30 billion a month to its $2.4 trillion hoard of reserves. The International Monetary
Fund expects China to have a 2010 current surplus of more than $450 billion — 10 times the 2003 figure. This is the most
distortionary exchange rate policy any major nation has ever followed.
And it's a policy that seriously damages the rest of the world. Most of the world's large economies are stuck in a liquidity
trap — deeply depressed, but unable to generate a recovery by cutting interest rates because the relevant rates are
already near zero. China, by engineering an unwarranted trade surplus, is in effect imposing an anti-stimulus on these
economies, which they can't offset.
So how should we respond? First of all, the U.S. Treasury Department must stop fudging and obfuscating.
Twice a year, by law, Treasury must issue a report identifying nations that ""manipulate the rate of exchange between their
currency and the United States dollar for purposes of preventing effective balance of payments adjustments or gaining
unfair competitive advantage in international trade."" The law's intent is clear: the report should be a factual determination,
not a policy statement. In practice, however, Treasury has been both unwilling to take action on the renminbi and unwilling
to do what the law requires, namely explain to Congress why it isn't taking action. Instead, it has spent the past six or
seven years pretending not to see the obvious.
Will the next report, due April 15, continue this tradition? Stay tuned.
If Treasury does find Chinese currency manipulation, then what? Here, we have to get past a common misunderstanding:
the view that the Chinese have us over a barrel, because we don't dare provoke China into dumping its dollar assets.
What you have to ask is, What would happen if China tried to sell a large share of its U.S. assets? Would interest rates
soar? Short-term U.S. interest rates wouldn't change: they're being kept near zero by the Fed, which won't raise rates
until the unemployment rate comes down. Long-term rates might rise slightly, but they're mainly determined by market
expectations of future short-term rates. Also, the Fed could offset any interest-rate impact of a Chinese pullback by
expanding its own purchases of long-term bonds.
It's true that if China dumped its U.S. assets the value of the dollar would fall against other major currencies, such as the
euro. But that would be a good thing for the United States, since it would make our goods more competitive and reduce
our trade deficit. On the other hand, it would be a bad thing for China, which would suffer large losses on its dollar
holdings. In short, right now America has China over a barrel, not the other way around.
So we have no reason to fear China. But what should we do?
Some still argue that we must reason gently with China, not confront it. But we've been reasoning with China for years, as
its surplus ballooned, and gotten nowhere: on Sunday Wen Jiabao, the Chinese prime minister, declared — absurdly —
that his nation's currency is not undervalued. (The Peterson Institute for International Economics estimates that the
renminbi is undervalued by between 20 and 40 percent.) And Mr. Wen accused other nations of doing what China actually
does, seeking to weaken their currencies ""just for the purposes of increasing their own exports.""
But if sweet reason won't work, what's the alternative? In 1971 the United States dealt with a similar but much less severe
problem of foreign undervaluation by imposing a temporary 10 percent surcharge on imports, which was removed a few
months later after Germany, Japan and other nations raised the dollar value of their currencies. At this point, it's hard to
see China changing its policies unless faced with the threat of similar action — except that this time the surcharge would
have to be much larger, say 25 percent.
I don't propose this turn to policy hardball lightly. But Chinese currency policy is adding materially to the world's economic
problems at a time when those problems are already very severe. It's time to take a stand.

When A Schedule Is More Than A Schedule
By Marc Am binder
The Atlantic.com
Mar 16 2010, 9:45 PM ET
Close observers of the State Department noticed something different this afternoon: on the daily schedule distributed
by the department includes, for the first time, information on Deputy Secretary of State Jim Steinberg's appointments.
Until recently, the daily release included Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's schedule only. No longer.
""Steinberg will meet Wednesday with Singaporean Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean.""
The inclusion of Steinberg suggests that the department is aware that it needs to do a better job of integrating
Steinberg's portfolio into its general communications strategy and show how the leadership of the department acts in
concert.
""Jim has always been an integral part of the Secretary's team, but we haven't always shown how crucial he is to State's
mission,"" said Philippe Reines, Clinton's communications consiglieri. ""This is a one simple way to fix that.""
The Beltway rumor mill often includes gossip that Steinberg isn't happy, or that he's not seen as an integral part of
President Obama's foreign policy team, or that his efforts aren't appreciated.
Reines, who rarely speaks on the record, responded to a question about whether Steinberg is indeed unhappy in this
way: ""I'm not a shrink, and I have to confess that we don't sit around in a circle often enough exploring our feelings. But
what is crystal clear to everyone is that Jim is smart, dedicated, and valued.""
Steinberg has a been a principal adviser on issues ranging from Iran -- he is the administration's team lead, cybersecurity
and China (he's been tasked with pressuring China into accepting tougher sanctions on Iran), but his work often goes
unnoticed.
On Friday, he is said to have given a tongue-lashing to the Israeli Ambassador to the U.S., Michael Oren, about that
country's actions during a visit by Vice President Biden.
When President Obama selected Gen. Jim Jones as National Security Adviser, he asked Clinton to make Steinberg her
deputy -- and she did. Since day one, prognosticators have been predicting friction between Steinberg and Clinton,
although none has publicly surfaced.","['Iran', 'China', 'China', 'Iran', 'U.S.']"

Was Obama's confrontation with Israel premeditated'?
Yossi Klein Halevi
4. March 16, 2010 17:13 pm
JERUSALEM—Suddenly, my city feels again like a war zone..Since the suicide bombings ended in 2005, life in
Jerusalem has been for the most part relatively calm. The worst disruptions have been the traffic jams resulting from
construction of a light rail. jUst like in a normal city. But navy, again, there are clusters of helmeted border nOtiCe near the
gates of the Old City. black smoke from burning tires in the Arab village across from my porch, young men marching with
green Islamist flags toward my neighborhood, ambulances parked at strategic places ready for this city's ultimate
nightmare.
The return of menace to Jerusalem is not because a mid-level bureaucrat announced stage four of a seven-stage process
in the eventual construction oft,600 apartments in Ramat Shiomo. a Jewish neighborhood in northeast Jerusalem. Such
announcements and building projects have become so routine over the years that Paestinians have scarcely responded,
let alone violently. In negotiations between Palestinians and Israelis, the permanence of Ramat Shiomo, and other Jewish
neighborhoods in East Jerusalem, has been a given. Ramat Shlomo, located between the Jewish neighborhoods of
French Hill and Rarrot, will remain within the boundaries of Israeli Jerusalem accord ng to every peace plan. Unlike the
Snail Jewish enclaves inserted into Arab neighbochoocis, on which Israelis are strongly buliding in the established
Jewish neighborhoods of East Jerusalem defines the national consensus.
Why, then, the outbreak of violence now? Why Harness ""day of rage"" over Jerusalem and the Palestinian Authority's call
to gather on the Temple Mount to ""save"" the Dome of the Rock from non-existent plans to build the Third Temple? Why
the sudden outrage over rebuilding a synagogue, destroyed by the Jordanians in 1948, in the Old City's Jewish Quarter,
when dozens of synagogues and yeshivas have been built in the quarter without incident?
The answer lies not in Jerusalem but in Washington. By placing the issue of building in Jewish neighborhoods in East
Jerusalem at the center of the peace process, President Obama has inadvertently challenged the Palestinians to do no
less.
Astonishingly. Obama is repeating the key tactical mistake of his failed efforts to restart Middle East peace talks over the
last year. Though Oben-la's insistence on a settlement freeze to help restart negotiations was legitimate, he went a step
too far by including building in East Jerusalem. Every Israeli government over the last four decades has built in the Jewish
neighborhoods of East Jerusalem; no government, let alone one headed by the Likud, could possibly agree to a freeze
there. Obama made resumption of negotiations hostage to a demand that could not be met. The result was that
Palestinian leaders were forced to adjust their demands accordingly.
Obama is directly responsible for one of the most absurd turns in the history of Middle East negotiations. Though
Palestinian leaders negotiated with Israeli governments that built extensively in the West Bank, they now refused to sit
down with the first Israeli government to actually agree to a suspension of building. Obama's demand for a building freeze
in Jerusalem led to a freeze in negotiations.
Finally, after intensive efforts, the administration produced the pathetic achievement of ""proximity talks""—setting
Palestinian-Israeli negotiations back a generation, to the time when Palestinian leaders refused to sit at the same table
with Israelis.
That Obama could be guilty of such amateurishness was perhaps forgivable because he was, after ail, an amateur. But
he has now taken his failed policy and intensified it. By demanding that Israel stop building in Ramat Shlomo and
elsewhere in East Jerusalem—and placing that demand at the center of American-Israeli relations—he's ensured that the
Palestinians won't show up even to proximity talks. This is no longer amateurishness; it is pique disguised as policy.
Initially, when the announcement about building in Ramat Shlomo was made, Israelis shared Vice President Biden's
humiliation and were outraged at their government's incompetence. The widespread sense here was that Netanyahu
deserved the administration's condemnation, not because of what he did but because of what he didn't do: He failed to
convey to all parts of his government the need for caution during Biden's visit, symptomatic of his chaotic style of
governing generally.
But not even the opposition accused Netanyahu of a deliberate provocation. These are not the days of Yitzhak Shamir,
the former Israeli prime minister who used to greet a visit from Secretary of State James Baker with an announcement of
the creation of another West Bank settlement. Netanyahu has placed the need for strategic cooperation with the U.S. on
the Iranian threat ahead of the right-wing political agenda. That's why he included the Labor Party into his coalition, and
why he accepted a two-state solution—an historic achievement that set the Likud, however reluctantly, within the
mainstream consensus supporting Palestinian statehood. The last thing Netanyahu wanted was to embarrass Biden
during his goodwill visit and trigger a clash with Obama over an ultra-Orthodox neighborhood.
Nor is it likely that there was a deliberate provocation from the ultra-Orthodox Shas party, which runs the interior ministry
that oversees building procedures. Shas, which supports peace talks and territorial compromise, is not a nationalist party.
Its interest is providing housing for its constituents, like the future residents of Ramat Shlomo; provoking international
incidents is not its style.
Finally, the very ordinariness of the building procedure—the fact that construction in Jewish East Jerusalem is considered
by Israelis routine—is perhaps the best proof that there was no intentional ambush of Biden. Apparently no one in the
interior ministry could imagine that a long-term plan over Ramat Shiomo would sabotage a state visit.
In turning an incident into a crisis, Obama has convinced many Israelis that he was merely seeking, a pretext to pick a fight
with Israel. Netanyahu was inadvertently shabby; Obama, deliberately so.
Ac.t,cording to a banner headline in the newspaper Ma'ariv, senior Likud officials believe that Obama's goal is to topple the
Netanyahu government, by encouraging those in the Labor Party who want to quit the coalition.
The popular assumption is that Obama is seeking to prove his resolve as a leader by getting tough with Israel. Given his
ineffectiveness against Iran and his tendency to violate his own self-imposed deadlines for sanctions, the Israeli public is
not likely to be impressed. Indeed, Israelis' initial anger at Netanyahu has turned to anger against Obama. According to an
Israel Radio poll on March 16, 62 percent of Israelis blame the Obama administration for the crisis, while 20 percent
blame Netanyahu. (Another 17 percent blame Shas leader Eli Yishai.) •
In the last year, the administration has not once publicly condemned the Palestinians for lack of good faith—even though
the Palestinian Authority media has, for example, been waging a months-long campaign denying the Jews' historic roots
in Jerusalem. Just after Biden left Ramailah, Palestinian officials held a ceremony naming a square in the city after a
terrorist responsible for the massacre of 38 Israeli civilians. That too didn't merit an administration rebuke.
Obama's one-sided public pressure against Israel could intensify the atmosphere of ""open season"" against Israel
internationally. Indeed, the European Union has reaffirmed it is linking improved economic relations with Israel to the
resumption of the peace process—as if it's Israel rather than the Palestinians that has refused to come to the table.
If the administration's main tactical error in Middle East negotiating was emphasizing building in Jerusalem, its main
strategic error was assuming that a two-state solution was within easy reach. Shortly after Obama took office, Rehm
Emanuel vvas quoted in the Israeli press insisting that a Palestinian state would be created within Obama's first tent.
instead, a year later, we are in the era of suspended proximity talks. Now the administration is demanding that Israel
negotiate over final status issues in proximity talks as a way of convincing the Palestinians to agree to those talks--as if
Israelis would agree to discuss the future of Jerusalem when Palestinian leaders refuse to even sit with them.
To insist on the imminent possibility of a two-state solution requires amnesia. Biden's plea to Israelis to consider a
withdrawal to an approximation of the 1967 borders in exchange for peace ignored the fact that Israel made that offer
twice in the last decade: first, when Prime Minister Ehud Barak accepted the Clinton Proposals of December 2000, and
then more recently when Prime Minister Ehud Olmert renewed the offer to Mahrnoud Abbas. Abbas, says Olmert, never
replied.
The reason for Palestinian rejection of a two-state solution is because a deal would require Palestinians to confine the
return of the descendants of the 1948 refugees to Palestine rather than to Israel. That would prevent a two-state solution
from devolving into a bi-national, one-state solution. Israel's insistence on survival remains the obstacle to peace.
To achieve eventual peace, the international community needs to pressure Palestinian leaders to forgo their claim to Haifa
and Jaffa and confine their people's right of return to a future Palestinian state--just as the Jews will need to forgo their
claim to Hebron and Bethlehem and confine their people's right of return to the state of Israel. That is the only possible
deal: conceding my right of return to Greater Israel in exchange for your right of return to Greater Palestine. A majority of
Israelis—along with the political system—has accepted that principle. On the Palestinian side, the political system has
rejected it.
In the absence of Palestinian willingness to compromise on the right of return, negotiations should not focus on a two-
state solution but on more limited goals.
There have been positive signs of change on the Palestinian side in the last few years. The rise of Hamas has created
panic within Fatah, and the result is, for the first time, genuine security cooperation with Israel. Also, the emergence of
Salem Fayyad as Palestinian prime minister marks a shift from ideological to pragmatic leadership (though Fayyad still
lacks a power base). Finally, the West Bank economy is growing, thanks in part to Israel's removal of dozens of
roadblocks. The goal of negotiations at this point in the conflict should be to encourage those trends.
But by focusing on building in Jerusalem, Obama has undermined that possibility too. To the fictitious notion of a peace
process, Obama has now added the fiction of an intransigent Israel blocking the peace process.
The administration, according to a report in the Israeli ne\Aispaper Yedito Aharonot, is making an even more insidious
accusation against Israel. During his visit, wrote Yediot Aharanot, Bicien told Israeli leaders that their policies are
endangering American lives in Afghanistan and Iraq. The report has been denied in the White House. Whether or not the
remark was made, what is clear today in Jerusalem is that Obama's recklessness is endangering Israeli--and Palestinian--
lives. As I listen to police sirens outside my window, Obama's political Intifada against Netanyahu seems to be turning into
a third intifada over Jerusalem.

Axelrod, thought of as pro-Israel, could send a tough signal. Still, couldn't the administration have sent Hillary Clinton to

Religion and human rights
The limits of freedom and faith
Mar 31st 2010
From The Economist print edition
Opponents of a bid by Muslim states to ""protect religion"" claim a small success
How dare you call us blasphemers?
IT DOES not happen often: Christian lobbyists, the sort who favour prayer in American classrooms and
crucifixes in Italian ones, lining up on the same side as secularists who battle to curb religion's role in the
public square. But in both those camps there has been some quiet satisfaction after a recent vote at the
United Nations. Not over the outcome, but over the slim margin of defeat.
On March 25th the Human Rights Council (HRC), a Geneva-based UN agency which often exasperates its
Western members, voted by 20 votes to 17, with eight abstentions, for a text that lists the ""defamation of
religion"" as an infringement of liberty. Nothing amazing there: the Organisation of the Islamic Conference
(OIC), which groups 56 mainly Muslim states (plus Palestine), has been working to push resolutions of
that kind through the General Assembly and other UN bodies since 2005. But the margin was the smallest
ever, and opponents think there could be a good chance of defeating a ""defamation"" motion next time one
comes around.
The OIC's idea is to establish the principle that faiths need protection, just as individuals do. It denies any
sinister intention (see article). And to some ears, the OIC's effort sounds like harmless UN-speak, but
nothing more. (The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, a congressionally
mandated body, has noted a logical flaw: defamation means harming the reputation of a living person or
entity: that implies that one can't defame an idea or a religious founder who is no longer, at least
physically, alive on earth.)
But critics of the OIC campaign, who include atheists, Christians and indeed some Muslims, say the
""defamation"" idea is worse than hot air: far from protecting human rights, it emboldens countries that use
blasphemy laws to criminalise dissent. What encourages these critics is that more countries seem to be
coming around to their view. Mexico, Uruguay, Argentina, Zambia and South Korea voted against the
latest resolution. Brazil criticised the text but abstained.
Deeper still inside the UN's bureaucracy, another battle over religion rages—and the stakes could be even
higher. An ""ad hoc committee"" is mulling ways to amend or extend the UN convention on racial
discrimination. Certain states want language that would fuse the categories of race and faith; some want a
new convention, or a protocol to the existing one.
For secularists (in the broad sense of people, including believers, who oppose the idea of faith having
privileged access to power), all this is alarming. Non-binding resolutions against defamation are bad
enough; a UN treaty on race-plus-religion would have legal force, at least for its signatories, and give
heart to theocrats.
At the HRC's latest discussion of this effort in March, the Algerian who oversees the project was keen to
plough ahead. But countries like Switzerland, Japan, Mexico, Argentina and France retorted that it would
be better to enforce the existing UN norms than dream up new ones. Efforts to widen the racism accord
will resume, with a new chairman, late this year—but critics are relieved to have stalled it. Still, would-be
theocrats may now focus harder on adding to the racism charter, because they face a real risk of being
defeated over defamation, in the view of Roy Brown, Geneva spokesman for the International Humanist
and Ethical Union.
Meanwhile a Christian-inspired NGO, the European Centre for Law and Justice, has been denouncing the
abuse of blasphemy laws in many OIC member states. How fair is their point? It is an easy case to make,
for example, over Pakistan.
Some 41 complaints of blasphemy were registered by police in Pakistan last year, says that country's
independent Human Rights Commission. In theory, blasphemy is punishable by death—a penalty that has
been handed down but never carried out. Worst-hit by the law are minorities like Christians and Ahmadis,
a group whose claim to be Muslim is rejected by the Pakistani state. Although abuse of the law is less rife
now than in the 1980s, when an Islamist general tightened up the rules, the law is still invoked in disputes
(over property, say) that have nothing to do with faith.
""The most vulnerable people, that is religious minorities, continue to be charged with
blasphemy,"" said Ali Dayan Hasan, a researcher at Human Rights Watch, a campaign group.
""But are people convicted? No. Rarely. It is used as an instrument of political and social
coercion.""
When convictions occur, they lead to long jail terms; and pre-trial detention can last for years. Pakistan's
parliament is revising the constitution but it has left intact the religious bits, despite a vow by the ruling
party to review the blasphemy laws. (Indonesia too has stepped back from a move to liberalise its
blasphemy regime.)
On Pakistani streets, the law has dire effects. In January 2009, in a village in Punjab province, five
Ahmadis, a labourer and four children, were charged with blasphemy. They had supposedly written
""Prophet Muhammad"" on the wall of a mosque toilet. The children were behind bars for nearly six months
till the charge was quashed.
And last September a young Pakistani Christian was accused of throwing part of the Koran down a drain.
It seems that his real crime, however, was affection for a Muslim woman. A mob torched a church, and
many Christians had to flee. He was taken to jail, where he died a few days later. His family alleged
torture; the authorities claimed suicide. There was mayhem at the funeral and the country's Christians
(see picture) were appalled. In some places, it is not the ""defamation"" of faith that threatens rights but
measures that supposedly defend it.","['Mexico', 'Uruguay', 'Argentina', 'Zambia', 'South', 'Korea', 'Brazil', 'Switzerland', 'Japan', 'Mexico', 'Argentina', 'France', 'Geneva', 'Pakistan', 'Pakistan', 'Indonesia', 'Punjab', 'province']"

the years. And I would like to ask what she makes of how such a committed Democrat as Barnett is able to work so well
in his professional life for noted Republicans on book projects and other work. (A theme of the piece is how some say

Labour c.uIi win most seats at eneral
election, poll shows
Guardian/ICM poll reveals gap between two main parties at four points — the closest in an ICM poll for almost two years
• Julian Glover
• aardian.co.uk, Monday 5 April 2010 19.02 BST
• Article history
Lbr still has a fighting chance of winning the most seats in the general election, according to a Guardian/1CM poll
published today.
The findings suggest Tory hopes of a defining breakthrough have been overplayed, with the gap between the two main
parties now at just four points — the closest in an 1CM poll for almost two years.
Labour support has climbed four points to 33% since an ICM poll carried out for the Guardian last week. Conservative
backing has dropped one since then to 37% — Labour's best ICM rating since December 2008 and the Tories' worst since
February.
On a uniform national swing, these figures could leave Labour 30 seats short of an overall majority. Even if the Tories
perform better than average in marginal seats — as most people expect — David Cameron would struggle to establish a
secure parliamentary basis for power.
Either party could be left dependent on the fiber:a) Democrats, who are on 21% in the poll — down two from last week.
Despite that decline, the Lib Dems will be pleased by the strength of their position going into the election. The party has
been at or above 20% in seven of this year's 11 ICM polls.
Meanwhile support for other parties, which peaked last spring in the European elections, has fallen again to just 9%.
At the start of an election campaign likely to see more polling than ever before in British politics, today's figures will be
treated with caution unless confirmed by other surveys.
Some polls late last week suggested the Conservative lead had grown rather than shrunk, and research may have been
affected by the Easter holidays, when some voters would have been away from home. Yet the results suggest that
Labour's chances should not be written off, and events such as the leaders' debates could prove decisive in the coming
weeks.
Today's poll suggests 60% of people are planning to watch at least one debate, with 29% saying they plan to watch all
three. Only 39% of voters said they would not watch any of them.
The ICM survey also asked voters whether they might switch away from their first choice party and, if so;who they might
back instead.
Labour and Tory support is now equally solid. Overall, 71% of Labour supporters say they will definitely back Labour while
71% of Tories also say they will stick with their first choice party.
Lib Dems, however, are less loyal — only 52% are sure they will end up giving Nick Clegg their vote. That leaves just over
a quarter of each main party's supporters considering backing another party.
The proportion of Lib Dems and ConservatIves. saying they might vote Labour instead has doubled since ICM last asked
this question earlier in the year. The ICM figures suggest the maximum potential vote for Labour and the Conservatives —
all their definite supporters, plus all potential switchers — is running neck and neck at 42%. The Lib Dem maximum is 28%.
Realistically, Labour is unlikely to beat its 2005 share of 36% and even today's poll suggesting it has shed only three
points since then will surprise many. Nonetheless, there is all to play for as the contest begins now.
•ICM Research interviewed a random sample of 1,001 adults aged 18 and over by telephone on 1-3 April 2010.

Strategic Communications
First, let me say how shocked we all were by the news over the weekend. I know this is a very difficult time for everyone
at the Mission and our thoughts are with all of you.
I had a good conversation with Jim Williams about the strategic communications initiative and I wanted to bring you up
to speed on our thinking and where things stand with Keith.
Based on our discussions and the excellent paper that Jim prepared I think there are several critical areas that we need
to address:
• Work with our counterparts in the Mexican government to help them develop their capacity to handle the
communications aspects of the drug initiative more effectively
• Develop a process for ensuring the GOM and USG have clear, coordinated and consistent messaging on all
aspects of the initiative
• Increase public awareness in Mexico about ""Merida"" ; based on a report I got from INR last week there is very
little awareness or understanding of the program in Mexico and the contributions of USG
• Work with GOM to develop an on-going and effective communications strategy at all levels to provide people
across the country with information that is directly relevant to them and which they need to navigate their way
through this crisis. For example, what is going on in their community; what are local authorities doing; what
programs are available in their schools; what can they do, etc. I have increasingly come to believe that the lack
of this sort of ""personally relevant"" information at a time of crisis increases public anxiety and contributes to the
overall sense of things being out of control. We have begun to focus on this issue and have worked both in Haiti
and last year in Pakistan to provide people with a steady stream of information they can use. We are using a
wide array of communications tools to deliver these messages that allows the information to be delivered in a
very granular ,local, personal way. The other benefit of this approach is that it helps balance the steady stream
of gruesome news being put out by traditional media.
• Work with private sector in both Mexico and US to develop broad based PSA campaign to increase awareness of
the initiative and maintain public support for the effort
• Increase awareness in Mexico of USG efforts to combat drug use in US
Keith has reached out to a number of his associates at BDA and unfortunately he has met with some resistance to BDA
taking this project on. The personal safety issue seems to be the biggest concern. I do believe we will be able to
overcome this to some degree and I have some ideas which we can discuss when we next speak. In the meantime I have
reached out to Pat Mitchell of the Paley Center and she believes she will be able to help engage the US private sector
once we have a plan of action in place.
Finally, with regard to next week's trip by S, Jim feels it might be better for me to come to Mexico sometime in late April
rather than have it as part of next week's agenda. I am happy to do whatever works best for you. Keith is also prepared
to come next week or in April. Just let us know.

Statement by the Secretary
The Death of Polish President Kaczynski and His Delegation
I join President Obama in offering my deepest condolences to the people of Poland, to the Kaczynski family, and to the
families of all those killed in this tragedy. Lost alongside President Kaczynski and his wife were Polish leaders from
across the political spectrum, men and women who shaped and sped Poland's post-1989 democratic transformation and
were leading Poland into its promising future. The tragedy of these lives cut short will be felt deeply across the world,
but their legacy will live on in a free and flourishing Poland.
The United States stands with the Polish people in this difficult hour. Like the country he led, President Kaczynski was
one of America's most valued and trusted allies. He was well known in the United States as a champion for democracy
against an oppressive regime, a man whose journey took him from the Gdatisk Shipyards to the presidency of a free
people. President Kaczynski was an unstinting advocate for freedom and human rights not just in Poland, but around
the world. He will be long remembered and sorely missed.
The Polish people have endured more than their share of sorrow, but they have always shown resilience and resolve in
the face of adversity -- and I know they will pull- together in solidarity to grieve this loss.
My thoughts and prayers are with all the people of Poland today.","['Poland', 'Poland', 'Poland', 'Poland', 'United', 'States', 'America', 'United', 'States', 'Poland', 'Poland']"

The Doomsday Weapon
IT IS already a commonplace to say that people who don't learn from history are condemned
to repeat their mistakes.
Some 1942 years ago, the Jews in the province called Palaestina launched a revolt against the
Roman Empire. In retrospect, this looks like an act of madness. Palestine was a small and
insignificant part of the world-wide empire which had just won a crushing victory against the
rival power — the Parthian Empire (Persia) — and put down a major rebellion in Britain. What
chances could the Jewish revolt have?
God knows what was going on in the mind of the ""Zealots"". They eliminated the moderate
leaders, who warned against provoking the empire, and gained sway over the Jewish
population of the country. They relied on God. Perhaps they also relied on the Jews in Rome
and believed that their influence over the Senate would restrain the Emperor, Nero. Perhaps
they had heard that Nero was weak and about to fall.
We know how it ended: after three years, the rebels were crushed, Jerusalem fell and the
temple was burned down. The last of the Zealots committed suicide in Masada.
The Zionists did indeed try to learn from history. They acted in a rational way, did not provoke
the great powers, endeavored in every situation to attain what was possible. They accepted
compromises, and every compromise served them as a basis for the next surge forward. They
cleverly utilized the radical stance of their adversaries and gained the sympathy of the whole
world.
But since the beginning of the occupation, their mind has become clouded. The cult of
Masada has become dominant. Divine promises once again start to play a role in public
discourse. Large parts of the public are following the new zealots.
The next phase is also repeating itself: the leaders of Israel are starting a rebellion against the
new Rome.
WHAT BEGAN as an insult to the Vice President of the United States is developing into
something far bigger. The mouse has given birth to an elephant.
Lately, the ultra-right government in Jerusalem has started to treat President Barack Obama
with thinly veiled contempt. The fears that arose in Jerusalem at the beginning of his term
have dissipated. Obama looks to them like a paper black panther. He gave up his demand for a
real settlement freeze. Every time he was spat on, he remarked that it was raining.
Yet now, ostensibly quite suddenly, the measure is full. Obama, his Vice President and his
senior assistants condemn the Netanyahu government with growing severity. Secretary of
State Hillary Clinton has submitted an ultimatum: Netanyahu must stop all settlement activity,
East Jerusalem included; he must agree to negotiate about all core problems of the conflict,
including East Jerusalem, and more.
The surprise was complete. Obama, it seems, has crossed the Rubicon, much as the Egyptian
army had crossed the Suez Canal in 1973. Netanyahu gave the order to mobilize all the
reserves in America and to move forward all the diplomatic tanks. All Jewish organizations in
the US were commanded to join the campaign. AIPAC blew the shofar and ordered its
soldiers, the Senators and Congressmen, to storm the White House.
It seems that the decisive battle has been joined. The Israeli leaders were certain that Obama
would be defeated.
And then an unusual noise was heard: the sound of the doomsday weapon.
THE MAN who decided to activate it was a foe of a new kind.
David Petraeus is the most popular officer of the United States army. The four-star general,
son of a Dutch sea captain who went to America when his country was overrun by the Nazis,
stood out from early childhood. In West Point he was a ""distinguished cadet"", in Army
Command and General Staff College he was No. 1. As a combat commander, he reaped
plaudits. He wrote his doctoral thesis (on the lessons of Vietnam) at Princeton and served as
an assistant professor for international relations in the US Military Academy.
He made his mark in Iraq, when he commanded the forces in Mosul, the most problematical
city in the country. He concluded that in order to vanquish the enemies of the US he must win
over the hearts of the civilian population, acquire local allies and spend more money than
ammunition. The locals called him King David. His success was considered so outstanding
that his methods were adopted as the official doctrine of the American army.
His star rose rapidly. He was appointed commander of the coalition forces in Iraq and soon
became the chief of the Central Command of the US army, which covers the whole Middle East
, except Israel and Palestine (which ""belong"" to the American command in Europe).
When such a person raises his voice, the American people listen. As a respected military
thinker, he has no rivals.
THIS WEEK, Petraeus conveyed an unequivocal message: after reviewing the problems in his
AOR (Area Of Responsibility) — which includes, among others, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran,
Iraq and Yemen — he turned to what he called the ""root causes of instability"" in the region. The
list was topped by the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
In his report to the Armed Services Committee he stated: ""The enduring hostilities between
Israel and some of its neighbors present distinct challenges to our ability to advance our
interests in the AOR...The conflict foments anti-American sentiment, due to a perception of
U.S. favoritism for Israel. Arab anger over the Palestinian question limits the strength and
depth of U.S. partnerships with governments and peoples in the AOR and weakens the
legitimacy of moderate regimes in the Arab world. Meanwhile, al-Qaeda and other militant
groups exploit that anger to mobilize support. The conflict also gives Iran influence in the
Arab world through its clients, Lebanese Hizballah and Hamas.""
Not content with that, Petraeus sent his officers to present his conclusions to the Joint Chiefs
of Staff,
In other words: Israeli-Palestinian peace is not a private matter between the two parties, but a
supreme national interest of the USA. That means that the US must give up its one-sided
support for the Israeli government and impose the two-state solution.
The argument as such is not new. Several experts have said more or less the same in the past.
(Immediately after the 9/11 attacks, I wrote in a similar vein and prophesied that the US would
change its policy. It did not happen then.) But now this is being stated in an official document
written by the responsible American commander.
The Netanyahu government immediately went into damage-limitation mode. Its
spokespersons declared that Petraeus represents a narrow military approach, that he doesn't
understand political matters, that his reasoning is faulty. But it is not this that made people in
Jerusalem break out into cold sweat.
AS IS well known, the pro-Israel lobby dominates the American political system without limits
— almost. Every American politician and senior official is mortally afraid of it. The slightest
deviation from the strict AIPAC line is tantamount to political suicide.
But in the armor of this political Goliath there is a chink. Like Achilles' heel, the immense
might of the pro-Israel lobby has a vulnerable point that, when touched, can neutralize its
power.
It was illustrated by the Jonathan Pollard affair. This American-Jewish employee of a sensitive
intelligence agency spied for Israel. Israelis consider him a national hero, a Jew who did his
duty to his people. But for the US intelligence community, he is a traitor who endangered the
lives of many American agents. Not satisfied with a routine penalty, it induced the court to
impose a life sentence. Since then, all American presidents have refused the requests of
successive Israeli governments to commute the sentence. No president dared to confront his
intelligence chiefs in this matter.
But the most significant side of this affair is reminiscent of the famous words of Sherlock
Holmes about the dogs that did not bark. AIPAC did not bark. The entire American Jewish
community fell silent. Almost nobody raised their voice for poor Pollard.
Why? Because most American Jews are ready to do anything — just anything — for the
government of Israel. With one exception: they will not do anything that appears to hurt the
security of the United States. When the flag of security is hoisted, the Jews, like all Americans,
snap to attention and salute. The Damocles sword of suspicion of disloyalty hangs above their
heads. For them, this is the ultimate nightmare: to be accused of putting the security of Israel
ahead of the security of the US. Therefore it is important for them to repeat endlessly the
mantra that the interests of Israel and the US are identical.
And now comes the most important general of the US Army and says that this is not so. The
policy of the present Israeli government is endangering the lives of American soldiers in Iraq
and Afghanistan.
FOR NOW, this is being said only as a side remark, in a military document that has not been
widely aired. But the sword has been drawn from its scabbard - and American Jews have
started to tremble at the distant rumble of an approaching earthquake.
This week, Netanyahu's brother-in-law has used our own doomsday weapon. He declared that
Obama is an ""anti-Semite"". The official newspaper of the Shas party has asserted that Obama
is really a Muslim. They represent the radical right and its allies, who argue in speech and in
writing that ""Hussein"" Obama is a Jew-hating black who must be beaten in the coming
congressional elections and in the next presidential ones.
(Yet an important poll in Israel published yesterday shows that the Israeli public is far from
convinced by these insinuations: the vast majority believes that Obama's treatment of Israel is
fair. Indeed, Obama got higher marks than Netanyahu.)
If Obama decides to fight back and activate his doomsday weapon - the accusation that Israel
puts the lives of American servicemen at risk - this would have catastrophic consequences
for Israel.
For the time being, this is only a shot across the bow - a warning shot fired by a warship in
order to induce another vessel to follow its instructions. The warning is clear. Even if the
•present crisis is somehow damped down, it will inevitably flare up again and again as long as
the present coalition in Israel stays in power.
When the movie ""Hurt Locker"" won its awards, the entire American public was united in its
concern about the lives of its soldiers in the Middle East. If this public becomes convinced
that Israel is sticking a knife in their back, it will be a disaster for Netanyahu. And not just for
him.","['Palaestina', 'Roman', 'Empire', 'Palestine', 'Persia', 'Britain', 'Rome', 'Jerusalem', 'Masada', 'Masada', 'Israel', 'Rome', 'United', 'States', 'Jerusalem', 'Jerusalem', 'East', 'Jerusalem', 'East', 'Jerusalem', 'Suez', 'Canal', 'America', 'US', 'United', 'States', 'America', 'Vietnam', 'Princeton', 'Iraq', 'Mosul', 'US', 'Iraq', 'US', 'Middle', 'East', 'Israel', 'Europe', 'Afghanistan', 'Pakistan', 'Iran', 'Iraq', 'Yemen', 'Israel', 'U.S.', 'Israel', 'U.S.', 'Iran', 'USA', 'US', 'US', 'Jerusalem', 'Israel', 'US', 'Israel', 'United', 'States', 'Israel', 'US', 'Israel', 'US', 'Iraq', 'Afghanistan', 'Israel', 'Israel', 'Israel', 'Israel', 'Israel', 'Middle', 'East', 'Israel']"

Tory lead narrows amid huge voter
disenchantment, Times poll finds
olmage :1 of 20,
Peter Riddell
The general election race is tightening, according to a Populus poll for The Times that reveals deep public
disenchantment with the campaign so far.
The poll, undertaken yesterday and this morning, says that more voters are now hoping for a hung parliament than either
a Tory or a Labour outright victory.
Conservative support has slipped by three points over the past week to 36 per cent, while Labour is a point up at 33 per
cent. The Liberal Democrats are unchanged on 21 per cent.
The polls tend to fluctuate by a couple of points either way. and these shifts are within the margin of error of the average.
With other new polls pointing to a firming in Labour support, the party may have enjoyed a small boost from its manifesto
launch. Tory strategists will hope to have achieved a boost from its manifesto launch today.
If the Populus figures were repeated in the general election in three weeks' time, and there is a uniform switch in votes,
Labour would be the largest single party, with about 300 MPs, ahead of the Tories on 264 and the Lib Dems on 54. This
would point to a Lab/Lib Dem coalition. But many analysts do not expect a uniform national swing.
The latest poll shows that 32 per cent of the public now hope for a hung parliament (as opposed to expecting one),
against 28 per cent wanting a Tory majority and 22 per cent a Labour one. Lib Dem voters prefer a deal with Labour than
the Tories in a hung parliament, by 44 to 31 per cent. The public is evenly split 40 to 42 per cent about whether they want
Labour or the Tories in either a majority or a minority government.
The poll shows that the number expecting a Tory overall majority has risen by three points to 34 per cent over the past
week. This only just exceeds the number expecting a hung parliament, at 33 per cent, down six points compared with a
week ago. Overall, 57 per cent expect the Tories to be the largest party, against 29 per cent expecting Labour to be.
The public is deeply sceptical about the honesty of the parties. Only 4 per cent think that they are being completely honest
about their tax plans, 61 per cent partly honest. Only 6 per cent say they are being completely honest about cutting the
deficit and 61 per cent partly honest. Some 7 per cent say that they are being completely honest about the extent to which
they can fund their policies by cutting waste and 58 per cent partly honest.
Voters were asked to say which party had proposed eight key manifesto pledges. They wrongly identified four: reducing
the increase in national insurance contributions (naming Labour not the Tories); allowing unsuccessful schools, hospitals
and the police (the Tories, not Labour); tightening up takeover rules (the Tories not Labour); and requiring foreign workers
employed in public services to speak fluent English (the Tories not Labour).
In only one case, the £150-a-year tax break, did more than half of voters (60 per cent) correctly identify the party making
the proposal.
In most cases, the pledge will make little difference to people's votes, apart from three made by Labour: the foreign
workers language pledge, doubling paid paternity leave and allowing the takover of unsuccessful schools, hospitals etc.
More than two fifths (43 per cent), including 50 per cent of women, say ""none of the parties"", or ""don't know"", when asked
which party is putting across a convincing cases to voters. This compares with 25 per cent naming the Tories and 18 per
cent Labour.
Just over half the public (54 per cent) plan to watch the first televised leaders' debate on Thursday evening. Men and
middle class professionals are more likely to say that they will view. More than two fifths (42 per cent) expect David
Cameron to win the debate, against 22 per cent for Gordon Brown. More Tories (70 per cent) than Labour voters ( 57 per
cent) expect their leader to win.
Two fifths of the public (42 per cent, up one point on a week ago) say it seems like a change from Labour, but are not sure
that it is time for a change to the Conservatives. Some 33 per cent, down one point, think it is time for a change to the
Tories.
Populus interviewed a random sample of 1,525 adult voters on April 12 to 13. Interviews were conducted across the
country and have been weighted to be representative of all adults. For more details go to www.populus.co.uk.

4536,"Update on interagency sharing of foreign audience researchMadam Secretary,
Jake asked me to send you a brief update on the effort to create an internal USG website for housing interagency
information about the attitudes, concerns, and media habits of foreign audiences (following up on the memo INR sent to
you on this subject in February).
INR is working with the interagency to create six initial country pages (Indonesia, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran, and
Yemen) on this website. In addition to background information about each country and its relationship with the United
States, each page will focus on providing up to date information on how local audiences view the United States and an
analysis of the mediums through which local audiences get their news. Pages will also include a list effective messaging
themes that would resonate with target audiences in each country.
In the coming weeks, INR will be receiving interagency feedback on these initial draft web pages, and will be seeking
guidance as to which additional countries should be covered. The hope is that each page will evolve over time based on
user feedback.
Please let me know if you would like any further information.

STATEMENT BY SECRETARY CLINTON
IRAQI NATIONAL ELECTIONS
I congratulate all the people of Iraq who participated in national elections today and over the past three days. There is
no better rebuke to the violent extremists who seek to derail Iraq's progress. Our thoughts and prayers are with the
families who lost friends and loved ones, and we salute the determination of the Iraqi people to reaffirm their
commitment to democracy and to charting their own future free of fear and intimidation.
Thanks to the efforts of the Iraq High Electoral Commission and the Iraqi Security Forces, which organized the voting and
ensured security at thousands of polling sites throughout the country, Iraqi men and women from all parts of the
country were able to go to the polls and choose their leaders freely.
I also would like to commend Ambassador Hill, General Odierno and all the U.S. civilian and military personnel who
supported this historic effort.
Iraqis have chosen a new government to lead their country at a critical time. In the coming months, we will work
together with Iraqi leaders as our partnership continues its transition to a primarily civilian focus, with the goal of
building a long-term, multidimensional relationship between our two nations - a relationship that will contribute to
stability in the Middle East and growing peace and prosperity in Iraq.

down after three minutes
Latest row comes on eve of critical vote in Stormont assembly on transfer of justice powers from London to Belfast
• Henry McDonald, Ireland correspondent
• quardian.co.uk, Monday 8 March 2010 17.36 GMT
• Article history
A meeting between the Ulster Unionists and Northern Ireland's deputy first minister aimed at securing the party's support
for the devolution of policing and justice broke down in acrimony this evening.
The encounter between Martin McGuinness and a UUP delegation lasted all of three minutes at Stormont.
The latest row comes on the eve of a critical vote in the Stormont assembly on transferring justice and policing powers
from London to Belfast. The UUP has indicated it will not support the last act of devolution because they believe the entire
power-sharing executive is dysfunctional.
Sir Reg Empey, the UUP leader, told the Guardian last month his party would not support the transfer of these powers
unless it obtained concessions on education — specifically the retention of academic selection to grammar schools at 11.
Following the aborted meeting today, the UUP released a statement condemning both McGuinness and Peter Robinson,
the first minister, who is leader of the rival Democratic Unionist party. The UUP claimed it had been ejected from the
deputy first minister's office.
A UUP spokesman said: ""An ill-tempered deputy first minister attempted to aggressively lecture the Ulster Unionist party
on policing and justice. He ridiculously accused us of being an anti-agreement party. Our delegation robustly reminded the
deputy first minister that we were the party which brought power-sharing government to Stormont.
""Quite clearly dissent and disagreement are unacceptable to Sinn Fein — unfortunately for Mr McGuinness, a party voting
against a motion with which it disagrees is basic, normal democratic politics.""
The spokesman added that McGuinness's ""angry and aggressive attempt to lecture"" the UUP was ""wholly unacceptable"".
""When challenged on his tone, the meeting broke down. The UUP will not take lectures on our commitment to devolution
from Martin McGuinness.
""If this is how Sinn Fein understands power-sharing, then it is small wonder that the [Northern Ireland] executive is
dysfunctional.""
If the DUP and Sinn Fein press ahead with the vote it is highly likely that the leader of the centrist, non-sectarian Alliance
party, David Ford, will become the first justice minister for Northern Ireland.
The SDLP will back the transfer of policing and justice powers in the Assembly tomorrow. However the nationalist party is
angry that it is not being offered the justice ministry. Under the rules governing the hand-out of ministries in the power-
sharing government the SDLP are officially entitled to choose the next ministry.
The party opposes the appointment of Ford as justice minister but will still support the transfer of these powers as they
want to be seen to continue to back the power-sharing arrangement.
US Congress warns Cameron over danger of
failed Ulster police deal
Yes vote on Hillsborough agreement would see policing and criminal justice powers devolved to Belfast next month

David Cameron has been given a stark warning from Washington that dissident terrorists will be ""emboldened"" to intensify
their attacks in Northern Ireland and millions of dollars of US investment will be threatened if he fails to persuade the
Tories' Ulster Unionist partners to endorse the final stage of the peace process.
In a sign of deep unease in Washington at the Tories' electoral pact with the UUP, a bipartisan group of US Congress
members have demanded Cameron must ""aggressively"" encourage his partners to endorse the deal in a vote in the
Northern Ireland assembly on Tuesday.
""At this defining moment in the peace process, it is crucial that all the political parties speak with one voice about their
shared future,"" the members of Congress wrote in a private letter to Cameron.
Without a unanimous vote, they said, the province's elected officials would be sending the wrong message to the people
they represent, and to the world.
""Dissidents are trying to destabilise the political institutions and turn the clock back ... These dissidents will continue to be
emboldened if they sense there is no political unanimity on the way forward ... The challenge of bringing good jobs to
Northern Ireland will be made more difficult if potential investors do not believe there is political stability.""
The letter by congressional leaders of the 41 million-strong Irish-American community has been passed to the Guardian
before the crucial vote on last month's Hillsborough agreement between Sinn Fein and the Democratic Unionists.
A yes vote would see policing and criminal justice powers devolved to Belfast next month in what the British government
has dubbed the final piece in the jigsaw of the 1998 Good Friday agreement.
The congressmen and women, whose views reflect the private misgivings of the US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton,
wrote to Cameron after learning that his electoral partners in Northern Ireland were voicing doubts about endorsing the
deal. Clinton is said to be alarmed that Cameron has either failed, or not bothered, to warn the UUP of the dangers of
obstructing the deal.
A Tory source said: ""David Cameron has consistently made clear that we support the devolution of policing and criminal
justice powers ... We welcomed the agreement between the DUP and Sinn Fein. The final details are for the parties in the
executive, working as a four-party coalition, to decide. We hope that between now and Tuesday any outstanding issues
can be solved.""
The Hillsborough agreement was brokered last month under a system endorsed by the UUP when it was the largest party
in Northern Ireland. This says that any change must have the consent of 50% of both the nationalist and Unionist
communities and 50% of the assembly.
Sir Reg Empey, the UUP leader who was one of the architects of the Good Friday agreement, will meet his party's
executive tomorrow night to decide how to vote.
The deal could still be passed tomorrow without the support of the UUP because the DUP's 36 assembly members
account for more than 50% of the unionist bloc. But there are fears in Washington that a no vote from the UUP, seen as a
moribund force until Cameron breathed new life into it, would destabilise many members of the DUP and undermine
support for the devolution of policing and criminal justice powers.
US eyes on Northern Ireland in countdown to
crucial peace vote
Hillary Clinton, the White House and Congressional leaders look for a yes vote in Belfast
By Nick Watt
Guardian
For a few hours tomorrow, the United States will turn its attention to Northern Ireland. Democratic and Republican leaders
will both be watching to see whether all mainstream political parties endorse the final stage in the implementation of the
Good Friday Agreement: the devolution of policing and criminal justice powers.
Sir Reg Empey, the leader of the Ulster Unionist party, is meeting his executive tonight to decide whether to vote yes.
Empey has severe doubts about the deal between Sinn Fein and the Democratic Unionist party. This would see policing
and criminal justice powers devolved to Belfast next month — a key nationalist demand — in return for the long-standing
unionist demand for a review of the way in which contentious parades are run.
Intense pressure is being placed on Empey to fall into line. Hillary Clinton, the US secretary of state who has taken a keen
interest in Northern Ireland since the peace process was launched in the early days of her husband's presidency, spent
15 minutes talking to Empey by phone, according to BBC Northern Ireland.
But transatlantic pressure has also been brought to bear on the other side of the Irish Sea. I reported this morning that a
group of bipartisan US Congressmen have written to David Cameron asking him to use his influence with the UUP, which
recently formed an electoral pact with the Tories, to vote yes.
The unease among the US Congress members is shared by Hillary Clinton. She is said to believe that Cameron would be
well advised to follow the example of John Major, who was respected as an impartial referee.
The concerns in the US will raise questions about claims made in private recently by William Hague. The shadow foreign
secretary is saying that, despite their political differences, he is forging a strong bond with Clinton.
But all sides need to be careful. The Tories, who support the deal between Sinn Fein and the DUP, believe that ministers
need to be careful about frightening the UUP with too much political pressure. The government was this morning
trumpeting a poll, commissioned by them, which showed overwhelming support among UUP voters for a yes vote. But, as
Slugger O'Toole notes, there is some debate about the methodology.
""It almost feels like the government want the UUP to vote no so they can draw one of Gordon Brown's beloved dividing
lines and say we are to blame for it all going wrong,"" one Tory tells me.","['London', 'Belfast', 'Ireland', 'Northern', 'Ireland', 'Stormont', 'London', 'Belfast', 'Northern', 'Ireland', 'Northern', 'Ireland', 'US', 'Hillsborough', 'Belfast', 'US', 'Washington', 'Northern', 'Ireland', 'US', 'Washington', 'Northern', 'Ireland', 'Northern', 'Ireland', 'Belfast', 'US', 'Northern', 'Ireland', 'Northern', 'Ireland', 'Washington', 'US', 'Northern', 'Ireland', 'White', 'House', 'Belfast', 'United', 'States', 'Northern', 'Ireland', 'Belfast', 'US', 'Northern', 'Ireland', 'Northern', 'Ireland', 'US', 'US', 'US']"

Former US president George Bush has called David Cameron over his concerns for the Northern Ireland peace process.
Photograph: Andrew Parsons/PA
The former US president George Bush has made a direct plea to David Cameron to support the Northern Ireland peace
process, amid widespread concern in the US about the Tories' new electoral pact with the Ulster Unionists.
In his most active intervention since leaving the White House, Bush took the rare step of calling the Conservative leader to
ask him to use his influence to press his unionist partners to endorse the final stages of the 15-year search for a
settlement.
Bush, who took a close interest in the peace process during his years in the White House, telephoned Cameron last
Friday to ask him to plead with the UUP leader, Sir Reg Empey, to endorse the deal in a vote tomorrow in the Northern
Ireland assembly.
Democrats and Republicans fear that the peace process could be undermined if the Ulster Unionist party, formerly
Northern Ireland's largest party, which governed the province until direct rule was imposed in 1972, votes against the
devolution of policing and criminal justice powers to Belfast.
While the UUP does not have enough votes to scupper the deal, the White House fears a no vote from the UUP could
undermine support for the settlement within the Democratic Unionist party and among the wider unionist community.
Cameron has faced intense pressure in recent months over his decision to form an electoral pact with the UUP, which
could provide him with crucial support if the general election leads to a hung parliament. The pact has prompted fears in
Washington that Cameron may abandon the even-handed approach to Northern Ireland adopted by John Major in the
early years of the peace process.
The Guardian understands that the White House is so concerned that the US economic envoy to Northern Ireland, Declan
Kelly, persuaded Bush to intervene. The former president telephoned Cameron to ask him to use his influence to
persuade Empey to vote for the deal.
""There was a feeling that a conservative to conservative conversation was the right way to go about this,"" said one source
familiar with the transatlantic negotiations. ""This conversation was borne out of the concern that Empey is holding out.""
Another source familiar with the contact said: ""This is the most active thing George W Bush has done in his post-
presidency period. He has been incredibly restrained and diplomatic since leaving the White House. He has maintained
radio silence.""
One source familiar with thinking on Northern Ireland on both sides of the Atlantic added: ""The fact that George W Bush
has decided to intervene is really significant. He was interested in the peace process as president and appointed an
envoy. It is a general sign of how concerned people are in the US about what David Cameron is up to.""
A Tory source said: ""George Bush did have a conversation with David Cameron. It was a positive conversation. David
underlined his commitment to the agreement and said we are doing all we can to support it. But he said that we cannot
force Sir Reg to vote for it. George Bush thanked David and said, 'I can see you are engaged.""
The disclosure of Bush's intervention came as Empey met the executive of his party tonight to decide whether to endorse
the deal brokered last month at Hillsborough Castle between Sinn Fein and the Democratic Unionists that would see
policing and criminal justice powers devolved to Belfast next month.
B6
The UUP leader, who is minister for employment and learning in the four-party power sharing executive, believes it is
foolish to devolve the final set of powers while the coalition is struggling to function. In a sign of Empey's unease about
endorsing the deal, a meeting between the UUP and the Sinn Fein deputy first minster, Martin McGuinness, broke up
after just three minutes tonight.
The White House and political leaders across the spectrum in the US have been watching developments with care. Hillary
Clinton, the US secretary of state, today pleaded with Empey in a 15-minute telephone call to support the deal.
A group of US Congress members wrote to Cameron last month to issue a stark warning that dissident terrorists will be
""emboldened"" to intensify their attacks if he fails to persuade the Tories' partners to endorse the final stage of the peace
process.","['Northern', 'Ireland', 'US', 'Northern', 'Ireland', 'US', 'Northern', 'Ireland', 'US', 'Northern', 'Ireland', 'Northern', 'Ireland', 'Belfast', 'Washington', 'Northern', 'Ireland', 'US', 'Northern', 'Ireland', 'Northern', 'Ireland', 'Atlantic', 'US', 'Belfast', 'US', 'US']"

Time to break the fog of Middle East politics
By David Ignatius
Sunday, March 21, 2010; A19
Diplomats love ambiguity. It allows them to fuzz up the hard parts of a negotiation -- the ""final status"" issues, as they're
often called -- and save them for later, when the parties are more amenable to pressure.
This devotion to ""constructive ambiguity"" has been a hallmark of U.S. peacemaking on the Palestinian-Israeli issue for 40
years. Rather than state the unpalatable concessions that most analysts recognize will be required for any viable
settlement -- that Israelis must share sovereignty in Jerusalem and that Palestinians must give up the ""right of return"" to
Israel -- successive U.S. administrations have tried to defer these unmentionables until later.
But the fog machine blew apart this month, when the isr3e1Interipr i‘,1!inista_rndLinced du
..ripq. visit ily__Vde President
Biden that Israel would build 1,600 more housipg priits in ,lerusal.
erp. The Obama administration was upset, to put it
mildly: Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called the housing announcement a ""deeply negative signal"" about U.S.-Israeli
relations and ""an insult.""
In the ensuing hubbub over the ""crisis"" in U.S.-Israeli relations, there have been frantic attempts to pretend it was all a
misunderstanding and pull the cloak of ambiguity back over the peace process. But that's a mistake.
The East Jerusalem move wasn't an accident but an emphatic public statement of the Israeli right's rejection of
concessions on Jerusalem. Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu had been trying to play along with U.S. requests to fuzz
the issue by avoiding provocative actions on Jerusalem. But the right-wing Shas party, which controls the Interior Ministry,
basically called his bluff.
""Freezing building in East Jerusalem is one of those things we cannot do,"" said Dore Gold, a right-wing former Israeli
ambassador to the United Nations. And Avigdor Lieberman, the Israeli foreign minister and a settler himself, responded:
""Can you imagine if they told Jews in New York they could not build or buy in Queens?""
So what should the administration do, now that the Israeli right has put Jerusalem squarely on the table despite the best
efforts of the ambiguity-addicted diplomats?
The administration's best strategy is to do what it considered a year ago, which is to state clearly the basic principles that
must frame these negotiations. Those guidelines have been articulated well by Zbigniew Brzezinski, the former national
security adviser: real sharing of Jerusalem; no right of return for the Palestinians; a return to the 1967 borders, with mutual
adjustments to allow for big Israeli settlement blocks; and a demilitarized Palestinian state. Every negotiation for the past
four decades has converged toward those parameters.
The Obama administration debated whether to issue such a statement of principles a year ago, when it began its
peacemaking effort. Launching negotiations with this ""big bang"" made sense to some officials, including Gen. Jim Jones,
the national security adviser, But George Mitchell, the Middle East envoy, argued that based on his experience in the
Northern Ireland peace talks, it was better to let the parties haggle before the United States stepped in with bridging
proposals.
Rather than stating U.S. negotiating principles at the outset, the Obama team decided instead to push Netanyahu on
settlements. The administration picked this fight in the flush of President Obama's first months in office, confident that he
was so strong and Netanyahu so weak that if it came to a showdown, Netanyahu would cave. The Israeli leader coolly
bided his time, dickering about procedural issues while Obama got weaker politically by the month. Netanyahu finally
agreed in November to a temporary moratorium on new settlements -- but it excluded Jerusalem. The administration
should have seen what was coming.
In retrospect, it seems clear that the step-by-step approach was a mistake: Constructive ambiguity, in this case, proved
destructive. It allowed the Israeli right wing to perpetuate the idea that it could have it all -- obtain a peace deal without
making concessions on Jerusalem. And it allowed Netanyahu to continue his straddle.
Jerusalem is the hardest issue of all in the Israeli-Palestinian negotiation, and for that reason, would-be peacemakers
have wanted to save it for last. But this month's crisis makes that strategic waffling impossible. Thanks to the Israeli right,
the Jerusalem issue is joined.
What's needed now is for Obama to announce that when negotiations begin, the United States will state its views about
Jerusalem and other key issues -- sketching the outlines of the deal that most Israelis and Palestinians want. If Netanyahu
refuses to play, then we have a real crisis in U.S.-Israeli relations.

UUP rejects Tory plea and votes against
devolution of policing powers
New justice ministry is created without backing of Conservative allies in Stormont

The final part of the Northern Ireland devolution deal was put in place today, giving the province its first justice minister
since the Troubles erupted four decades ago.
Nationalists and unionists in the Stormont parliament voted together to create the new justice ministry, completing the last
act of the Good Friday agreement.
But there was discord inside the Stormont parliament after the Conservatives' allies in Northern Ireland, the Ulster
Unionists, and their 18-strong assembly team, voted against the move.
Despite an 11th hour intervention by David Cameron imploring the UUP to vote yes, the party refused to back the historic
measure.
The party's stance puts Cameron in a difficult position: he is in favour of the devolution of justice to Belfast, but his
electoral pact with the UUP risks exposing him to criticism that a Conservative government could not claim to be an
""honest broker"" when there are disagreements between the parties at Stormont.
Today's vote came just before 5pm, when 88 assembly members from Sinn Fein and the DUP joined the SDLP and
smaller parties to back the transfer of policing and judicial powers to Belfast.
But the UUP resisted pressure — from, among others, former US president George Bush — to support the measure.
Speaking on the assembly floor, Sir Reg Empey, the UUP leader, said his party had voted no ""as a democratic political
to a friend

party pledged to making power-sharing work in an inclusive manner for all the people of Northern Ireland, and we exercise
our rights refusing to bow to the blackmail and bullying to which we have been subjected in recent weeks.""
The deputy first minister, Sinn Fein's Martin McGuinness, earlier denounced the UUP stance, claiming it was intended to
embarrass the DUP.
""The UUP declared last night that they will not support this resolution,"" McGuinness told the assembly.
""That saddens and disappoints me. They are opposed in my view to the transfer for cynical party political reasons.""
In a statement after the vote, Gordon Brown praised the parties which backed the deal. ""Today the politics of progress
have finally replaced the politics of division in Northern Ireland,"" the prime minister said. ""The completion of devolution,
supported by all sections of the community in Northern Ireland, is the final end to decades of strife. It sends the most
powerful message to those who would return to violence: that democracy and tolerance will prevail.
""The courage and leadership of the parties who voted to complete devolution at Stormont will be noted around the world.""
The Conservatives welcomed the vote, without mentioning the UUP's rejection of the move. A Tory spokesman said: ""We
welcome the fact that devolution of policing and justice is going to happen. We wanted all four parties to be involved and
for it to be decided by local politicians.""
But the Liberal Democrats called on Cameron to ""clarify the position of his Tory-UUP alliance on the devolution of policing
and justice powers"".
Alistair Carmichael, their spokesman on Northern Ireland, said: ""With the UUP saying one thing, and the Tories saying the
complete opposite, voters will struggle to understand what exactly joint Tory-UUP candidates stand for. What we're seeing
is the Tories in complete disarray. When it takes George Bush to step in as the voice of reason, it's clear that David
Cameron has dug himself a very big hole.""
Carmichael added: ""This raises serious questions about David Cameron's judgment. If he can't manage to steer a straight
course in opposition, how on earth would he cope as prime minister?""
Earlier there was acrimony in the Great Hall at Stormont when a victims' campaigner attempted to serve a civil writ against
McGuinness.
Willie Frazer of the group Families Acting for Innocent Relatives threw the legal document in McGuinness's direction after
the deputy first minister refused to take it off him. Frazer is taking a civil action in Belfast high court against the Sinn Fein
MP because he alleges McGuinness directed the IRA's campaign during the Troubles. The south Armagh unionist's father
was shot dead by the IRA.
The FAIR spokesman said he had chosen yesterday because the DUP ""had betrayed me and other victims"" by agreeing
to devolve policing and justice powers. Frazer predicted that Sinn Fein would exercise a major influence over the police
and judiciary even though the centrist, non-sectarian Alliance party leader, David Ford, will be the first justice minister.
Frazer said: ""I am very disappointed in the DUP because for years they said the things victims wanted to hear and now
they have done a complete somersault. All along they told me that Sinn Fein would never get their hands on policing and
justice but they have a say. Mr Ford is answerable to the executive and that means the deputy first minister, Martin
McGuinness. That is why the only action left to me is a civil action. I feel very let down by a number of DUP people.""
The DUP will suffer at the polls for this U-turn, Frazer predicted.

Gates Says U.S. Lacks Strategy to Curb Iran's Nuclear Drive
By DAVID E. SANGER and THOM SHANKER
Published: April 18, 2010
WASHINGTON - Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates has warned in a secret three-page memorandum to top White
House officials that the United States does not have an effective long-range policy for dealing with Iran's steady progress
toward nuclear capability, according to government officials familiar with the document.
Several officials said the highly classified analysis, written in January to President Obama's national security adviser, Gen.
James L. Jones, touched off an intense effort inside the Pentagon, the White House and the intelligence agencies to
develop new options for Mr. Obama. They include a revised set of military alternatives, still under development, to be
considered should diplomacy and sanctions fail to force Iran to change course.
Officials familiar with the memo's contents would describe only portions dealing with strategy and policy, and not
sections that apparently dealt with secret operations against Iran, or how to deal with Persian Gulf allies.
One senior official, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the memo,
described the document as ""a wake-up call."" But White House officials dispute that view, insisting that for 15 months
they had been conducting detailed planning for many possible outcomes regarding Iran's nuclear program.
In an interview on Friday, General Jones declined to speak about the memorandum. But he said: ""On Iran, we are doing
what we said we were going to do. The fact that we don't announce publicly our entire strategy for the world to see
doesn't mean we don't have a strategy that anticipates the full range of contingencies - we do.""
But in his memo, Mr. Gates wrote of a variety of concerns, including the absence of an effective strategy should Iran
choose the course that many government and outside analysts consider likely: Iran could assemble all the major parts it
needs for a nuclear weapon - fuel, designs and detonators - but stop just short of assembling a fully operational weapon.
In that case, Iran could remain a signatory of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty while becoming what strategists call a
""virtual"" nuclear weapons state.
According to several officials, the memorandum also calls for new thinking about how the United States might contain
Iran's power if it decided to produce a weapon, and how to deal with the possibility that fuel or weapons could be
obtained by one of the terrorist groups Iran has supported, which officials said they considered to be a less-likely
possibility.
Mr. Gates has never mentioned the memo in public. His spokesman, Geoff Morrell, declined comment on specifics in the
document, but issued a statement on Saturday saying, ""The secretary believes the president and his national security
team have spent an extraordinary amount of time and effort considering and preparing for the full range of
contingencies with respect to Iran.""
Pressed on the administration's ambiguous phrases until now about how close the United States was willing to allow.
Iran's program to proceed, a senior administration official described last week in somewhat clearer terms that there was
a line Iran would not be permitted to cross.
The official said that the United States would ensure that Iran would not ""acquire a nuclear capability,"" a step Tehran
could get to well before it developed a sophisticated weapon. ""That includes the ability to have a breakout,"" he said,
using the term nuclear specialists apply to a country that suddenly renounces the nonproliferation treaty and uses its
technology to build a small arsenal.
Nearly two weeks ago, Mr. Obama, in an interview with The New York Times, was asked about whether he saw a
difference between a nuclear-capable Iran and one that had a fully developed weapon. ""I'm not going to parse that right
now,"" he said. But he noted that North Korea was considered a nuclear-capable state until it threw out inspectors and,
as he said, ""became a self-professed nuclear state.""
Mr. Gates has alluded to his concern that intelligence agencies might miss signals that Iran was taking the final steps
toward producing a weapon. Last Sunday on the NBC News program ""Meet the Press,"" he said: ""If their policy is to go to
the threshold but not assemble a nuclear weapon, how do you tell that they have not assembled? I don't actually know
how you would verify that."" But he cautioned that Iran had run into production difficulties, and he said, ""It's going slow -
slower than they anticipated, but they are moving in that direction.""
Mr. Gates has taken a crucial role in formulating the administration's strategy, and he has been known over his career to
issue stark warnings against the possibility of strategic surprise.
Some officials said his memo should be viewed in that light: as a warning to a relatively new president that the United
States was not adequately prepared.
He wrote the memo after Iran had let pass a 2009 deadline set by Mr. Obama to respond to his offers of diplomatic
engagement.
Both that process and efforts to bring new sanctions against Iran have struggled. Administration officials had hoped that
the revelation by Mr. Obama in September that Iran was building a new uranium enrichment plant inside a mountain
near Qum would galvanize other nations against Iran, but the reaction was muted. The next three months were spent in
what proved to be fruitless diplomatic talks with Iran over a plan to swap much of its low-enriched uranium for fuel for a
medical reactor in Tehran. By the time Mr. Gates wrote his memo, those negotiations had collapsed.
Mr. Gates's memo appears to reflect concerns in the upper echelons of the Pentagon and the military that the White
House did not have a well-prepared series of alternatives in place in case all the diplomatic steps finally failed. In fact,
just before Mr. Gates issued his warning, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. Mike Mullen, wrote an official
""chairman's guidance"" to his staff saying that while any military option would have ""limited results"" against Iran's
nuclear facilities, preparations needed to be stepped up.
""Should the president call for military options, we must have them ready,"" the admiral wrote.
Administration officials testifying before a Senate committee last week made it clear that those preparations were under
way. So did General Jones. ""The president has made it clear from the beginning of this administration that we need to be
prepared for every possible contingency,"" he said in the interview. ""That is what we have done from day one, while
successfully building a coalition of nations to isolate Iran and pressure it to live up to its obligations.""
At the same hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee, Lt. Gen. Ronald L. Burgess Jr., director of the Defense
Intelligence Agency, and Gen. James E. Cartwright, the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and one of the military's
most experienced officers on nuclear matters, said that Iran could produce bomb-grade fuel for at least one nuclear
weapon within a year, but that it would probably need two to five years to manufacture a workable atomic bomb.
The administration has been stepping up efforts to contain the influence of Iran and counter its missiles, including
placing Patriot anti-missile batteries, mostly","['U.S', 'Iran', 'WASHINGTON', 'United', 'States', 'Iran', 'Iran', 'Iran', 'Persian', 'Gulf', 'Iran', 'Iran', 'Iran', 'Iran', 'Iran', 'United', 'States', 'Iran', 'Iran', 'Iran', 'United', 'States', 'Iran', 'Iran', 'United', 'States', 'Iran', 'Tehran', 'Iran', 'North', 'Korea', 'Iran', 'Iran', 'United', 'States', 'Iran', 'Iran', 'Iran', 'Qum', 'Iran', 'Iran', 'Tehran', 'Iran', 'Iran', 'Iran']"

respect for you was much in evidence on all levels. Most of the cabinet turned out for the reception that the amb hosted
for me. The FM went out his way to tell me what it meant to get a call from you when he assumed his position (he's
hoping to have a few mins with you in Tallin). As far as Lith has to go, it has achieved some remarkable achievements for
Eastern Eur. They have a female president, Speaker, Finance minister and def. minister. I had a good meeting with the
President and thanked her for Lith commitment to our collective efforts in afghanistan. They run the smallest PRT and,
despite a tough economy, have done everything we've asked in terms of additional support since the surge. The meeting
with the Speaker and top women members of the parl'nt was yet another reminder of your inspiration over many years.
One of the women was at the Vienna W conf and said she's in politics today because of you. Another read about safe
birthing kits in your book and was inspired to send several thousand to Afghanistan. They are eager for more
opportunities to work together.
I came primarily to launch the new working group on gender that we and Lith are co-chairing. There was much gratitude
for our leadership with them in the Community of Democracies.
The meaning of democracy is so strong for people who had to stuggle for it more recently. They really feel this is an
important time to renew the understanding of democ, particularly after the bruising it underwent over the last several
years.
We had terrific turnout from other countries, many comments about you and references to Beijing and Iceland W conf.
(So many people told me the impact Vienna and Iceland had on them). We left our meeting with many commitments for
future concrete projects that will be undertaken. There is great hope that you will be in Krakow in July for the CD
ministerial. The Lith CD coordinator headed to Belgium the next day for an EU meeting. He told me he got a very positive
response for our gender initiative and that Ashton was particularly excited about it. The EU is locating their new gender
institute in Lithuania and they are ager for our help.
The Dutch minister who came
said the outcome of their election in June will say much about the nature of their ongoing commitment in Afg.
Lastly, I arrived shortly after the Polish tragedy. There is a very close relationship between the 2 countries and their grief

Courage and Consequence: Less Memoir Than
Hoax
Karl Rove's book Courage and Consequence is less memoir than hoax. The chapters that relate to the CIA leak scandal
are yet another attempt to deflect attention from his central role in the betrayal of Valerie Plame Wilson's identity as a
covert CIA officer.
His distortions and fabrications are consistent with his approach throughout this sordid and criminal affair. Wasting his
opportunity to tell the truth, he offers absolutely nothing new, and his selective use of facts and quotes are a transparent
effort to continue his long campaign to confuse people, unfortunately consistent with his past behavior.
His book is a pathetically weak defense of the disastrous policies pursued by the Bush administration, involving our
country in a war of choice based on false intelligence and badly tarnishing the good name of the United States of America.
Nothing in Karl Rove's book refutes those facts. His book, however, is illuminating in further exposing his political
methods, especially his reliance on personal insults, not simply towards Valerie and myself, but also towards all those
who opposed his unprincipled behavior.
If any additional proof to the irrefutable historical record were needed, Rove's book demonstrates once again the actions
of a vindictive, angry and petty man. Karl Rove betrayed his nation; now he has betrayed history.

Stormont votes to take over Northern Ireland
policing powers
•Power-sharing finalised as assembly agrees to first justice minister since Troubles
•Ulster Unionists oppose measure but Hillary Clinton welcomes assembly's yes vote
A 15-year search for a political settlement in Northern Ireland cleared its final hurdle today when unionists and nationalists
voted to transfer policing and criminal justice powers to Belfast, creating the province's first justice minister since the
Troubles erupted four decades ago.
Sinn Fein and the Democratic Unionist party (DUP), who were barely on speaking terms a few years ago, joined forces
with the nationalist SDLP in the Northern Ireland assembly to endorse a deal on policing, hammered out last month.
The justice minister will be appointed on 12 April and is likely to be David Ford, the leader of the centrist Alliance party.
The breakthrough was marred by a row when the Ulster Unionist party (UUP), which governed Northern Ireland for five
decades until the imposition of direct rule in 1972, voted against the deal.
Sir Reg Empey, the UUP leader, who recently formed an electoral pact with the Conservatives, said he had voted no
because his party did not believe that the four-party power-sharing executive was functioning properly. Empey, the
minister for employment and learning, said: ""We exercise our rights, refusing to bow to the blackmail and bullying to which
we have been subjected in recent weeks.""
The UUP hit out after facing intense pressure from London and the US to fall in behind David Cameron, who has backed
devolution of the criminal justice system. Gordon Brown phoned Empey shortly before today's vote, while former US
president George Bush pleaded with Cameron last week to persuade the UUP to support the deal.
Empey's unionist rivals, the DUP, who have overtaken the UUP in recent years, focused on what could happen after the
vote. The DUP leader, Peter Robinson, who managed to persuade all but one of his 36 assembly members to back the
devolution deal, said: ""The move is about completing and maintaining devolution, it is about whether we move forward
together as a society.""
The vote secures an extra £800m for policing and justice that Brown promised the assembly if they backed the transfer. It
also adds an extra 1,200 police officers. The prime minister praised the main parties for reaching the deal on an issue that
almost broke the power-sharing government.
He said: ""Today the politics of progress have finally replaced the politics of division in Northern Ireland. The completion of
devolution, supported by all sections of the community in Northern Ireland, is the final end to decades of strife. It sends
the most powerful message to those who would return to violence: that democracy and tolerance will prevail. The courage
and leadership of the parties who voted to complete devolution at Stormont will be noted around the world.""
The vote was also praised tonight by Hillary Clinton, the US secretary of state. She
said: ""I commend the Northern Ireland Assembly for its affirmation of the
Hillsborough Agreement and its endorsement of the devolution of policing and
justice, an important step in ensuring a peaceful and prosperous future for all of the
people of Northern Ireland for generations to come.""
Irish president Mary McAleese also hailed the move. ""Today's vote in the Northern Ireland assembly represents an
eloquent statement of confidence in the political institutions established under the Good Friday Agreement,"" she said.
Matt Baggott, chief constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, welcomed the vote as a step forward. ""Devolution
will strengthen our service. It will help to ensure communities receive the policing service that not only they deserve, but
that we are committed to delivering.
""The financial package is also welcomed ... it will help us deal with those who are living in the darkness of the past and
who have tried to disrupt this process and the lives of our community.""
But there was discord inside Stormont after the UUP and their 17-strong assembly team voted against the move.
Martin McGuinness, Sinn Fein's deputy first minister, denounced the UUP stance, claiming they were doing it to
embarrass the DUP. ""The UUP declared last night [Monday] that they will not support this resolution,"" McGuinness told
the assembly. ""That saddens and disappoints me. They are opposed in my view to the transfer for cynical party political
reasons."" He stressed that no single party could control the justice department.
The UUP no-vote will put pressure on the Tories, who will campaign with their allies in the general election, having taken
opposing sides on the biggest vote since the DUP and Sinn Fein started sharing power in 2007.
Cameron insisted that the Tories had played a constructive role, saying he would maintain his alliance with the UUP. ""We
want to move Northern Ireland politics forward — to focus on the issues that affect people in their everyday lives — rather
than remaining stuck in the past. That is why we remain totally committed to bringing national, mainstream UK politics to
Northern Ireland and to ending its semi-detached political status.""
Cameron's remarks were designed, in part, to reassure the White House, which fears a UUP no-vote could harden
unionist opinion against power-sharing.
Hardline Unionists turned on the DUP tonight. Jim Allister, the former DUP MEP, who now leads the breakaway
Traditional Unionist Voice, claimed his former party had ""rolled over in triple somersaults for Sinn Fein"". He also
suggested the new justice minister would be a ""pointless puppet keeping the seat warm for Sinn Fein"". Prior to the vote
the widow of the first Police Service of Northern Ireland officer to be murdered by dissident republicans urged all parties to
back the devolution of policing and justice powers. Kate Carroll, whose husband, Stephen, was killed by a Continuity IRA
sniper, said in an appeal to the UUP: ""It is heartbreaking that I have to get on this morning to please ask the politicians to
get on with their job.""","['Northern', 'Ireland', 'Northern', 'Ireland', 'Belfast', 'Northern', 'Ireland', 'Northern', 'Ireland', 'London', 'US', 'US', 'Northern', 'Ireland', 'Northern', 'Ireland', 'US', 'Northern', 'Ireland', 'Assembly', 'Northern', 'Ireland', 'Northern', 'Ireland', 'Northern', 'Ireland', 'Northern', 'Ireland', 'UK', 'Northern', 'Ireland', 'Northern', 'Ireland']"

deeply saddened to learn of the passing of Dr. Dorothy Height, an icon of America's long march toward equality and a
personal inspiration to us both. As the only woman among the ""Big Six"" civil rights leaders, Dr. Height helped galvanize a
movement that changed our country forever. She organized the ""Wednesdays in Mississippi"" meetings that brought
black and white women together to find common ground and break down barriers. She never stopped fighting for what
she knew was right. And through it all, she was always the best dressed woman in the room. We were blessed to know
Dr. Height, to benefit from her grace, passion and wisdom, and to call her our friend. For decades, starting with the early
days at the Children's Defense Fund, we worked with her, learned from her, and drew inspiration from her example.
From the Presidential Medal of Freedom, to the Congressional Gold Medal, to the unveiling of a long-sought-after bust
of Sojourner Truth in the United States Capitol, we had the privilege of helping honor Dr. Height and her
accomplishments. Born before women had the right to vote, denied access to the college of her choice because of the
color of her skin, and witness to nation divided, Dr. Height dedicated her life to the proposition that all Americans should
have the opportunity to live up to their full God-given potential. Our nation is poorer for her loss but infinitely richer for
the life she led, the progress she achieved, and the people she touched. Our thoughts and prayers are with Dr. Height's
family today, and with her many loving friends and colleagues. She would be the first to tell us that the best way to
honor her memory is to carry forward the work she started and the causes she championed, to open wide the freedom
gates. May we all find the strength and the wisdom to live up to her legacy.","['America', 'Mississippi', 'United', 'States', 'Capitol']"

economic development to political stability and more. This trilogy of speeches (with the right PR) could further
underscore our elevation of development AND our comprehensive, smart power approach to foreign policy. After

Obama Backs Down on Sudan
By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF
JUBA, Sudan
Until he reached the White House, Barack Obama repeatedly insisted that the United States apply more pressure on
Sudan so as to avoid a humanitarian catastrophe in Darfur and elsewhere.
Yet, as president, Mr. Obama and his aides have caved, leaving Sudan gloating at American weakness. Western
monitors, Sudanese journalists and local civil society groups have all found this month's Sudanese elections to be deeply
flawed - yet Mr. Obama's special envoy for Sudan, Maj. Gen. Scott Gration, pre-emptively defended the elections, saying
they would be ""as free and as fair as possible."" The White House showed only a hint more backbone with a hurried
reference this week to ""an essential step"" with ""serious irregularities.""
President Omar Hassan al-Bashir of Sudan - the man wanted by the International Criminal Court for crimes against
humanity in Darfur - has been celebrating. His regime calls itself the National Congress Party, or N.C.P., and he was
quoted in Sudan as telling a rally in the Blue Nile region: ""Even America is becoming an N.C.P. member. No one is against
our will.""
Memo to Mr. Obama: When a man who has been charged with crimes against humanity tells the world that America is
in his pocket, it's time to review your policy.
Perhaps the Obama administration caved because it considers a flawed election better than no election. That's a
reasonable view, one I share. It's conceivable that Mr. Bashir could have won a quasi-fair election - oil revenues have
manifestly raised the standard of living in parts of Sudan - and the campaigning did create space for sharp criticism of
the government.
It's also true that Sudan has been behaving better in some respects.
The death toll in Darfur is hugely reduced, and the government is negotiating with rebel groups there. The Sudanese
government gave me a visa and travel permits to Darfur, allowing me to travel legally and freely.
The real game isn't, in fact, Darfur or the elections but the maneuvering for a possible new civil war. The last north-south
civil war in Sudan ended with a fragile peace in 2005, after some two million deaths. The peace agreement provided for
a referendum, scheduled to take place in January, in which southern Sudanese will decide whether to secede. They are
expected to vote overwhelmingly to form a separate country.
Then the question becomes: will the north allow South Sudan to separate? The south holds the great majority of the
country's oil, and it's difficult to see President Bashir allowing oil fields to walk away.
""If the result of the referendum is independence, there is going to be war - complete war,"" predicts Mudawi Ibrahim
Adam, one of Sudan's most outspoken human rights advocates. He cautions that America's willingness to turn a blind
eye to election-rigging here increases the risk that Mr. Bashir will feel that he can get away with war.
""They're very naïve in Washington,"" Mr. Mudawi said. ""They don't understand what is going on.""
On the other hand, a senior Sudanese government official, Ghazi Salahuddin, told me unequivocally in Khartoum, the
nation's capital, that Sudan will honor the referendum results. And it's certainly plausible that north and south will
muddle through and avoid war, for both sides are exhausted by years of fighting.
Here in Juba, the South Sudan capital, I met Winnie Wol, 26, who fled the civil war in 1994 after a militia from the north
attacked her village to kill, loot, rape and burn. Her father and many relatives were killed, but she escaped and made her
way to Kenya - and eventually resettled as a refugee in California. She now lives in Olathe, Kan., and she had returned
for the first time to Sudan to visit a mother and sisters she had last seen when she was a little girl.
Ms. Wol, every bit the well-dressed American, let me tag along for her journey back to her village of Nyamlell, 400 miles
northwest of Juba.
The trip ended by a thatch-roof hut that belonged to her mother, who didn't know she was coming - so no one was
home. Ms. Wol was crushed.
Then there was a scream and a woman came running. It was Ms. Wol's mother, somehow recognizing her, and they flew
into each other's arms.
To me, it felt like a peace dividend.
Yet that peace is fragile, and Ms. Wol knows that the northern forces may come back to pillage again. ""I don't want
war,"" she said, ""but I don't think they will allow us to separate.""
My own hunch is that the north hasn't entirely decided what to do, and that strong international pressure can reduce
the risk of another savage war. If President Obama is ever going to find his voice on Sudan, it had better be soon.","['Sudan', 'JUBA', 'Sudan', 'White', 'House', 'United', 'States', 'Sudan', 'Darfur', 'Sudan', 'Sudan', 'Sudan', 'Darfur', 'Sudan', 'Blue', 'Nile', 'America', 'America', 'Sudan', 'Sudan', 'Darfur', 'Darfur', 'Darfur', 'Sudan', 'South', 'Sudan', 'Sudan', 'America', 'Washington', 'Khartoum', 'Sudan', 'Juba', 'South', 'Sudan', 'Kenya', 'California', 'Olathe', 'Kan.', 'Sudan', 'Nyamlell', 'Juba', 'Sudan']"

Day of the dead
More than 325 women have been murdered in the free-trade boomtown of Ciudad Juarez in the past decade. Faced with
government incompetence and corruption, people are rebelling.
By Max Blumenthal
Dec 4, 2002 I The body of another murdered woman was found late last month in the Mexican industrial hub of Ciudad
Juarez, dumped behind some shrubs in the squalor of the Anapra neighborhood, a ramshackle hodgepodge of corrugated
tin and cardboard shacks on the sludge-washed banks of the Rio Grande. Her hands had been tied, and the evidence
suggested she had been raped. The body was so badly decomposed that investigators calculated that she'd been dead
for seven months.
However horrific the details, they were numbing in their familiarity. The body of a woman who had died in similar
circumstances was found in the same dusty lot a couple of months earlier. The bodies of eight women were found in a lot
not far away a little more than a year ago. So many women have been murdered here in the past 10 years that there is no
reliable count. Most experts place it close to 325, an average of 32 a year, nearly three every month. At least 90 of the
deaths are believed to be the work of one or more serial killers. Hundreds more women have simply vanished.
Like so many of the others, the woman whose body was found in late October had probably come to Juarez from the
poverty of southern Mexico to work for about $10 a day in one of the many foreign-owned assembly plants known as
maquiladoras that sprouted up in Juarez after the North American Free Trade Agreement was signed in 1994. And like
them, too, her body was unclaimed in death and buried alone and anonymous.
Such death has become a way of life here. So, too, with the fear and paranoia that rise in such a climate. Nobody knows
who is doing the killings, and the mystery only seems to deepen. Arrests made by local authorities have produced
allegations of torture, witness tampering and frame-ups -- but no convictions. Most here believe that the killer or killers
must have enormous clout. Perhaps, some say, the killers are narcotrafficantes disposing of witnesses. Perhaps they are
the sons of the wealthy and powerful indulging in sick sex. Perhaps they are cultists whose members come from the
highest levels of government and finance. The theories differ, but a common assumption is that arrests made thus far are
only a smokescreen for an historically opaque and corrupt government that will protect its dark secrets at any cost.
One thing seems clear: The murders arise from a social landscape that has been transformed by global economic forces.
Where Ciudad Juarez was once a small, sleepy desert outpost just across the border from El Paso, Texas, the population
in the past decade has exploded to 1.2 million people, many of them drawn by the lure of the maquiladoras. The tides of
people have overwhelmed the ability of the city to absorb them, overwhelmed health services, social services and law
enforcement. Free-trade advocates once promised that NAFTA would transform Juarez into the City of the Future -- and
they have been proven right in a way they never could have imagined. Today, Juarez still has the feel of the lawless Old
West, but with a grim 21st century edge.
Despite promises of swift justice from Mexican President Vicente Fox and Chihuahua Gov. Patricio Martinez, they have
yet to take up offers of assistance from the FBI; bureau agents in Texas have suggested that official corruption is
hindering efforts to stop the murders. Chihuahua state investigators have seemingly adopted a ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy
towards Juarez's homicides, fostering an atmosphere of impunity and pervasive fear. Foreign corporations operating in
Juarez that have employed many of the murdered women largely deny that such an atmosphere exists.
But in this postmodern urban culture, where the very concept of community has broken down, many bereaved family
members and local activists have begun to take matters into their own hands, investigating the murders and speaking out
even if it means threats and other reprisals.
Evangeline Arce's daughter, Silvia, a street vendor, disappeared on Nov. 3, 1998. Since that day, she said, the authorities
have done little to investigate. ""Two days after my daughter disappeared, I went to the police and filed a report,"" the
mother says in Spanish, her face flaring with anger. ""They promised me prompt action but when I checked back a week
later, the Missing persons report was never filed and the investigation had not even begun. When they finally got
witnesses together, none of them would talk because they were too afraid.""
Even as Mexico continues to make strides toward becoming an open and democratic society, the epidemic of rape and
murder here has exposed the heavy residue of its corrupt and authoritarian political legacy as well as the contradictions of
its efforts at economic expansion.
To understand the magnitude of the breakdown, think of the sniper rampage in the Washington area this fall that left 10
people dead and three wounded. Imagine that Montgomery County Police Chief Charles Moose held a press conference
and asked local citizens to catch the sniper themselves because local police were not up to the task and the federal
government was not being helpful; imagine that the federal government charged that local officials in Montgomery County
were complicit in the killings and impeding the investigation. Chaos would ensue, certainly. But then, multiply. the number
of victims by 30, by 40, by 50, or more.
That's Juarez today.
The jumbled, exhaust-choked commercial core of this city has grown wildly in the wake of NAFTA, adding modern
shopping malls, condominiums and expansive boulevards. The population is growing at twice the rate of the national
average; it is expected to nearly double by 2010, to 2 million people. Many of them directly or indirectly rely on the 300 or
so maquiladoras for their livelihoods.
To accommodate the new army of workers, the city has given birth to entirely new sectors. The Campestre Juarez is a
luxurious conglomerate of gated communities, with a main gate that's a life-size replica of Paris' Arc de Triomphe. Nearby,
many of the maquiladoras are situated along the Avenida de la Industria. Though the assembly-line workers sometimes
can be glimpsed behind a plate glass window in aqua-blue uniforms, there usually is little sign of any activity behind the
maquiladoras' featureless walls.
Most of the new residents are poor, or on the brink of poverty, and they live in Anapra or another of the grim, violent
colonias populares on the outskirts of town. In those colonies, residents usually live without sanitation, running water,
electricity or paved roads.
Avenida Manuel Gomez Morin is the pothole-riddled six-lane avenue that ties these varied worlds together. Sitio Colosio
Valle, a medium-sized strip mall, stands on a corner of the avenue at the gateway to the industrial sector. It is fronted by a
vast parking lot and inside are various clothing outlets and boutiques. By day, the lot bustles as customers scurry back
and forth, hauling their purchases to their cars -- a sight similar to any mall in the suburban United States. By night,
however, traffic tapers off, stores lock up and the mall's lot becomes dark and desolate. Sitio Colosio Valle was where
many of the slain and missing women were last seen.
In the mall's parking lot, Braulio Rosas, a 40-year-old security guard, leans against the door of a giant Nike outlet. Inside
the store, under bright fluorescent lights, employees frantically check inventory and scramble to close up.
""A lot of girls were picked up here,"" Roses says in a voice of calm resignation. ""But really, it's the girls' fault. It's because
even though they weren't putas, [prostitutes] you know, they were more like fad/es [easy women]. They didn't have to get
into those cars if they didn't want to.""
Rosas sounds cynical, but blaming the victims is by no means an aberration in Juarez. Similar notions have been offered
by officials like Suly Ponce, the former Chihuahua special prosecutor in charge of the murdered women's cases.
""Sometimes there are cases that a girl meets some person, he strikes up a relationship with her, they drink ... and it ends
violently,"" she told the Washington Post in 2000, before she was promoted to a job in the governor's office. ""It's difficult to
know.""
A handful of the women found murdered since 1993 were indeed confirmed as prostitutes. But the truth is that a large
majority of the missing or murdered women were hardworking, young, poor and for the most part socially conservative.
Most had migrated to Juarez from Mexico's depressed south to work in the maquiladoras, sometimes arriving alone and
with little means of contacting their families back home.
The maquiladoras, run by companies like Delphi and RCA Thomson, prefer to hire young women for assembly-line jobs.
An entry-level assembly-line worker makes minimum wage, about $2 an hour. With experience, pay can rise to as much
as $2,50 an hour -- and compared to wages in Guerrero or Chiapas, that's good money. But in Juarez, the women are
caught in an economic trap: Since the cost of living here is only slighter lower than in El Paso, the wages that seem so
high to new maquiladora workers actually ensure poverty. The workers can be hired and fired on the spot, with little
pretext and no legal protection. And union activities are prohibited.
Even for those who accept the conditions, security is elusive. More often now, the global companies that own
maquiladoras are closing up shop and transferring operations to China to take advantage of lower taxes, investment
subsidies and outrageously cheap labor. On June 29, Royal Philips Electronics announced it was moving its P.C. monitor
manufacturing operations, at a cost of 900 jobs. On July 1, Scientific Atlanta fired 1,300 workers after shutting its plant
down. According to the Nov. 5 New York Times, this trend has cost Juarez 287,000 jobs in the maquiladoras since their
peak in October 2000.
Not only does this slash and burn the economic base. There are brutal social reverberations, too. The city's health
system, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, has reported 200,000 people falling from its list of insured after losing their
company policies, according to a July article in La Prensa. Esther Chavez Cano, director of Juarez's only battered-
women's shelter, Casa Amiga, said in a speech this summer that domestic violence cases had risen by 50 percent in July
alone.
The combination of poverty and a lack of social connections renders women on the assembly line powerless and virtually
invisible. And that has made them easy prey. According to the El Paso Times, about a third of the approximately 325 slain
women were employed by maquiladoras at the time of their murder.
Given that few of the maquiladoras provide shuttle service to and from the colonies, the female workers often are preyed
upon while walking through perilous places like Sitio Colosio Valle in the darkness of the early morning. At such an hour,
the only nearby activity is that of bars and nightclubs closing up as male patrons filter into the street after a long night of
drinking.
Besides China's attractive economic climate, an intangible cause of maquiladora flight is Juarez's chronic violence. The
effect is difficult to measure. Two companies in the city's industrial sector -- including TDK, the audio tape maker -- have
posted banners on their factories reading: ""STOP THE VIOLENCE. To Better Our City, Let's Unite."" But most foreign
companies are purely economic organisms governed entirely, it seems, by the dictates of efficiency. They have
maintained a stunning silence even as their female workers are slaughtered.
Consider the case of 17-year-old Claudia !vette Gonzalez. Her body was found in November 2001 along with seven
others in an overgrown cotton field on Avenida Technologico, just blocks from Sitio Colosio Valle mall and across the
street from the offices of the Association of Maquiladoras. She had worked on the assembly line for the Lear Corp., a
Detroit-based auto-interior supplier. Lear has declined to publicly address Gonzalez's murder.
Greg Bloom, editor of the Frontera Norte Sur -- an Internet news service that focuses on the U.S.-Mexico border --
recalled a conversation with Gonzalez's mother, Josefina, in which she recounted her daughter's last day. In the darkness
of the early morning, Gonzalez told him, Claudia set out for her job at Lear. When she arrived at work a few minutes late
after missing her bus, Claudia lvette was promptly sent away under a policy barring tardy assembly-line workers from their
shifts. A half-hour past when she usually would have returned home, her mother knew something was gravely wrong. Her
worst fear -- the same nagging fear shared by so many Juarez mothers -- would soon be realized.
Andrea Puchalsky, Lear's director of communications, acknowledged that the company has not made any public
statements regarding Gonzalez's murder, nor has it enacted any proactive measures to protect employees from another
wave of violence. ""Adding security is not a question that relates to Lear,"" she said. ""[Gonzalez's murder] did not happen
on Lear property.""
When questioned about the murder and Lear policies, Puchalsky mentioned that a company memo was prepared for her
with responses to possible questions. As to Lear's worker-lockout policy, which apparently put Gonzalez in a precarious
situation the day of her abduction, Puchalsky declined to comment on whether Gonzalez was locked out or sent home
from Lear's plant on her last day.
""We have a policy for tardiness and she was tardy many times,"" Puchalsky said. ""When she had arrived late to work her
shift, she was not there in time to work her shift.""
When asked whether Lear's offices in the U.S. have a similar policy in which late employees are barred from working their
shifts, Puchalsky reversed her earlier statement, vehemently denying that such a policy existed anywhere within Lear's
operations. ""There is not a policy to send a worker home after X number of tardy arrivals,"" she said. ""Typically what we do
is if there is someone arriving late on kind of a warning system, there might be a notification that 'the next time you arrive
late, you have to take a day off ...' It's not a policy, though. There is no written policy like that throughout Lear Corp.""
The body of 17-year-old Lilia Alejandra Garcia was found mutilated just 300 feet from her maquiladora in February 2001,
and since then her case has come to embody the incompetence and corruption of police and prosecutors from Ciudad
Juarez to the state capital in Chihuahua City and south all the way to Mexico City.
Garcia, the mother of a 5-month-old baby and a 2-year-old child, apparently was kidnapped just after she left work. She
was held in captivity for a week, repeatedly beaten and raped, and then strangled. Then-prosecutor Suly Ponce told the
Juarez newspaper El Diario that Garcia was the first woman of the year to be murdered and raped in this area of the city -
- even though two days before, the body of an unidentified woman was found naked just blocks away.
When an FBI leak revealed witness testimony linking Lilia Garcia's killers to drug dealers, Suly Ponce dismissed it, calling
it erroneous. She instead blamed workers in a circus across the street from the strip mall where Garcia was last seen.
When circus managers claimed that Ponce offered them money to blame co-workers, she dropped the investigation.
According to a July article in the El Paso Times, former Chihuahua state forensic chief Oscar Maynez Grijalva said Garcia
was killed in a similar manner as three of the eight women found in the cotton field with Claudia 'vette Gonzalez in
November 2001. Curiously, local authorities behaved just as evasively in that investigation as in Garcia's.
When Gonzalez and the seven other women's bodies were found in November 2001, ex-Chihuahua Attorney General
Arturo Gonzalez Rascon immediately fingered two local bus drivers as the culprits. Yet doubts about their guilt arose,
especially after Grijalva -- who was Rascon's evidence expert at the time -- resigned from his post, citing pressure to
fabricate evidence against them. And the head of a local prison was forced from office when he documented signs of
torture on the accused men after they had returned from Rascon's office.
Four months later, in February 2002, a search-and-rescue team combing the cotton field found Claudia lvette Gonzalez's
overalls in a plastic bag, along with strands of hair and other crucial pieces of evidence that Rascon's investigators had
failed to discover. In response, Rascon offered his opinion to the El Paso Times: ""The state police have done a thoroughly
professional job. I have no doubt about that."" But on Oct. 28, DNA results revealed that Rascon's investigators had
properly identified only one of the eight dead women -- Gonzalez.
Stuck with a far more dubious task than catching one madman or replacing one feeble leader, Juarez's fractured civil
society has been paralyzed. A cynical mood is palpable just by speaking to citizens on the street, who unanimously
express fear and distrust of law-enforcement and government officials. Some local cops are just as cynical.
""We can't just sit around in deserted places waiting for someone to drive up and dump bodies off,"" said one municipal
police officer seated in an idling paddy wagon who refused to give his name for security reasons. ""There are too few of us
and the city's too big ... We don't get much support from the federal government. Judicially, we are not protected like cops
in the U.S. Plus, the arms they give us are weak and the bulletproof vests don't really stop bullets. It's not just that,
though. I have a young woman in my home so I can put myself in the place of the parents who have lost their daughters.
But it's a question of society. We need their support and they need them to be more conscious if it is going to get any
better here.""
The scope of the crime is so enormous, and there has been so little success in stopping it, that suspicion breeds on itself.
The litany of theories as to who the killers are and what their motive might be suggests that Juarez has become a
breeding ground for every imaginable predator. And yet, nobody knows. Nothing is certain. And that feeds the climate of
paranoia.
Garcia and Gonzalez's murders are rumored to be the work of a serial killer with possible ties to drug dealers. Yet Garcia
was found with marks on her wrists that, according to local forensics experts, were identical to those made by police
handcuffs. And upon the discovery of her daughter's overalls, Josefina Gonzalez told the El Paso Times that someone
powerful was undoubtedly responsible for the murder.
Many in Mexico's law enforcement community agree that a ring of rich men are behind some of the killings, but they have
no evidence to support the theory. Some suggest that some young men from the local aristocracy are responsible, but are
being protected by their parents. A persistent theory holds that the murders -- or a significant subset of them -- are linked
to powerful narcotraficantes who have co-opted segments of the local ruling class.
And the cynicism has been exacerbated by the fact that of the 17 men and one woman accused as serial killer
masterminds of the murders, only one has been convicted, Abdel Latif Sharif Sharif, an Egyptian chemist and resident of
Texas at the time of his extradition to Mexico in 1995. Currently, Sharif is awaiting sentencing for allegedly paying a drug
trafficker named Victor Manuel Rivera Moreno to carry out about a dozen murders. However, evidence against Sharif is
suspect and charges against him have been changed repeatedly. Once he was even charged with killing a woman,
Elizabeth Ontiveros, who showed up later at police offices to prove she was alive.
In 1996, Sharif was accused of paying the gang Los Rebeldes to kill 17 women. Then, in 1999, he was charged with hiring
five bus drivers and an El Paso man from his jail cell to kill seven women. Officials claimed Sharif hired the killers to
deflect blame from himself. By 1999, judges had cleared him of all charges, citing an absence of concrete evidence and
the possibility of witness intimidation by prosecutors.
Suly Ponce, who supervised the case, has yet to make a compelling case against him. In a 1999 radio interview, rather
than presenting hard evidence, she claimed Sharif was aggressively hostile toward women because of his Egyptian
background. Now she says that the case against Sharif hinges on Moreno's declaration that Sharif paid him to carry out
the killings with money he earned from 13 patents he developed for Benchmark Research and Technology. But according
to an article in the El Paso Times, Benchmark has never paid employees for patent development. In a telephone interview
last week with Salon, Ponce said she hadn't known this. Angela Paiaveras, the current special prosecutor, declined to
discuss Sharif's case or any aspect of the investigations.
Many local residents scoff at the notion that the killers have been caught. ""We don't believe that the guys they have
arrested are the killers,"" says Miguel Angel Jaramillo, a mid-level manager for the Lear Corp. ""It's obvious that they're just
scapegoats.""
Yet Ponce remains ardent in her belief that Sharif is at the center of the murders. ""Today the killings continue because
there are many imitators,"" she told Salon last week. ""But after Sharif was caught, there were almost no homicides for a
year."" But according to the Juarez daily El Diario, the year immediately after Sharif was jailed -- a period spanning from
October 1995 to October 1996 -- 28 young women were found murdered.
Meanwhile, the theories flourish and become more and more paranoid, reflecting a breakdown in public trust. By one
popular theory, the women are being murdered at blood rituals for a cabal of wealthy, powerful men. Another theory posits
a financial motive for murder. ""We're finding a lot of girls that are mutilated in the same way,"" says a young municipal
police officer who declined to give his name. ""Someone's probably killing them to take their organs to sell them for a lot of
money in the U.S."" When asked if there was any evidence to support the theory, the officer replied that it was only a
hunch.
Such a climate sends a message to the killers every day: You can get away with anything, even a crime on this scale. But
where such a climate breeds cynicism and hopelessness among people who live and work here, it has also provoked an
incipient revolt.
On her radio show ""Grueso Calibre"" (""Large Caliber""), popular host Samira lzaguirre frequently aired the views of guests
who were critical of how authorities handled the murders. When Attorney General Rascon accused the two bus drivers of
the cotton field murders in November 2001, lzaguirre hosted the drivers' wives on her show. After that interview,
advertisements began appearing in local newspapers smearing lzaguirre with claims that she frequented strip clubs and
was romantically involved with one of the bus drivers. News media on both sides of the border have reported that the
receipt for the ad was signed by government officials who paid for it.
Then, in February, when lzaguirre started organizing a vigil and announced a hunger strike on her show on Radio Canon,
she was fired. Fearing for her safety, she moved across the border to El Paso.
Others, too, have discovered that pressing the complaint too forcefully brings reprisal. Marisela Ortiz, co-director of
Nuestras Hijas Regreso a Casa (Our Daughters Back Home), a legal support group for victims' parents, was a frequent
guest on ""Grueso Calibre."" Like Izaguirre, Ortiz has focused her resources on drawing attention to government and police
incompetence in the slain women's cases. And she says that, like lzaguirre, she has faced ever-increasing danger.
In Nuestras Hijas' office in central Juarez, located inside a small one-story row house with a ""For Rent"" sign out front,
Ortiz described the shadow of terror that has stalked her since she began pressuring the authorities.
She claims she was threatened by ex-Chihuahua District Attorney Arturo Gonzalez Rascon. ""Rascon came all the way to
Juarez [from Chihuahua City] to tell me not to involve myself in all the cases,"" she tells Salon. ""Then I got a message on
my phone saying: 'You have daughters that are alive. Take care of them."" Rascon, in an earlier story by the Associated
Press, denied the allegation.
Last May, Ortiz says, she was pursued by men in a black pickup truck who tried to kidnap her. She believes the attempt
was orchestrated by Rascon's office since it occurred only a day before she had planned to travel to El Paso for a meeting
with the FBI and Texas state Sen. Eliot Shapleigh, D-El Paso, who is calling for a bi-national investigation into the
murders.
Victims' parents who came to Nuestras Hijas for help in finding their missing daughters also say they have been
threatened. Mario Lee Lopez and his wife, Soledad Aguilar, lost their daughter, Cecilia Covarrubias. She was kidnapped
in 1995 along with their granddaughter, who was two months old. By now their granddaughter would be 7, and Lopez and
Aguilar's own investigation has led them to believe that she is alive and living in the custody of a well-connected local
family.
To an outsider it is a desperate story, all but impossible to prove. Lopez accuses Ponce of coordinating the coverup of the
kidnappings and murder: again, Ponce denies the charge. And she was adamant that government officials have harassed
no one. ""I didn't have any knowledge of threats against anybody,"" she said. ""On the contrary, we support the families and
they are encouraged to be intimately involved in the investigations.""
Lopez recalls an incident in which he had gone to Juarez's judicial building to press his granddaughter's case and did not
exactly find the kind of support Ponce mentioned. While leaving the court, Lopez says, he was confronted by a high-
ranking minister who warned that if he didn't drop the investigation, he would be tortured with electric shock devices.
""But it's too late to stop now,"" Lopez adds with a wistful smile.
Despite the campaign against lzaguirre, or perhaps because of it, the vigil took place as scheduled in March. It was an
unprecedented show of solidarity, with thousands of people gathered in the cotton field where Gonzalez and the seven
others were found in an irrigation ditch. There are still tatters of yellow police tape there, and candleholders left from the
vigil are strewn over the site. Eight red crosses mark the spot where the bodies were found.
However, city officials have no plans to memorialize the site as Juarez's residents have. In fact, according to a Sept. 4
article in El Diario, the site is now being used as a dumping ground for Juarez's Department of Parks and Gardens.
Near downtown Juarez there is a monument to Abraham Lincoln, honoring him for ""establishing North American
industries, today the most important in the world."" Not far away is a simple gallery where the Collective Antigone [Antigone
Collective], a group of local artists, has organized a series of public performances, installations and conferences focused
on Juarez's crisis of violence.
Each week, the artists gather to collaborate and discuss strategy. At a table with 12 other artists and writers, in an
expansive room filled with cubist-inspired paintings, Antonio Munoz Ortega, a 51-year-old writer, describes the Collective's
goals and the problems confronting the group. ""Our government is authoritarian, and authoritarian governments are
principally concerned with the manipulation of life,"" he says. ""The victims' families feel manipulated by the authorities'
insensitivity and this has manifested a greater and greater cynicism here that's really dangerous. The struggle, then, is for
reparation and simply regaining our daily lives.""
Ortega says he was moved to action by Samira Izaguirre's candlelight vigil in March. He describes the building of an
impromptu church in front of the Association of Maquiladoras office as an effort to ""communicate through a different
language, one that's symbolic."" This decision, he says, helped lead to the formation of the Collective.
The rallying cry for Collectiva Antigona, as evidenced by the name, has been Sophocles Greek tragedy, ""Antigone,""
which tells the tale of a girl's persecution at the hands of a cruel dictator for burying her brother. The Collectiva has
organized readings of the play around the state of Chihuahua and plans a public performance in the future.
The Collectiva also has begun to establish a visual presence around central Juarez, most noticeably by painting a wall
spanning an entire block with poetry written by participants in a recent writer's conference on violence against women. On
Nov. 1 and 2, the Mexican holiday Dia de los Muertos, the collective filled a room with traditional altars honoring the
victims along with a giant cross in the center of the room covered with masks, intended to symbolize the anonymity of the
victims. An estimated 1,500 people viewed the exhibit. A week later, working with Nuestras Hijas, the collective placed a
coffin and flowers and had a bonfire in the cotton field ditch where Claudia Ivette Gonzalez and seven others were found.
""It is absolutely necessary to affect civil society with the intention of shaking the indolence and to provoke some sort of
reaction from the people,"" says Mariela Paniagua, a 41-year-old painter. ""People are no longer affected by what is
happening in this city. They have lost the capacity for outrage in the face of these acts.""
While Collectiva Antigona meets, another group gathers a few miles away to combat Juarez's violence by drastically
different means. Past the seemingly endless rows of cardboard hovels in the desperately poor CoIonia Morelos, beyond
the municipal dump, on a rocky desert mesa in the shadow of Mount Indio, members of a search-and-rescue group called
Banda Civil spread out through the hills to search for more murder victims.
Luz Elena Guerrero Guerra, a strong-looking woman in her late 50s with an intense gaze, serves as president of one of
Banda Civil's six divisions. Guerra tells of how it began as a search-and-rescue group in 1985 to assist during a massive
earthquake in Mexico City and evolved to respond to Juarez's crisis. She herself found the first slain women's bodies in
1989, before investigators had even identified the deadly trend. Today, Banda Civil's members still lend their help during
natural disasters but the bulk of their work comes in the search for bodies, monitoring of schools and a citywide crime-
awareness campaign.
Ever-present terror, coupled with the impotence of Juarez's authorities, forced Banda Civil's transformation, Guerra says.
""I've narrowly escaped violence many times,"" she explains. ""Sometimes it is just pure luck that a bus or a taxi happens to
come by in time when someone is chasing me ... All of us, we're uncertain of what the authorities are telling us. That's our
indignation. If they [the authorities] aren't interested in helping, we'll pressure them.""
Because the group is required by law to cooperate with police, some view it with suspicion. Yet they have had success
where most other activist groups have failed. It was Banda Civil members who made the crucial discovery of Claudia
lvette Gonzalez's overalls in February, humiliating Attorney General Rascon and breathing new life into the investigation.
And Banda Civil has continued to find more evidence during their weekly searches of Juarez's human dumping grounds.
Besides its role as a search-and-rescue/quasi-vigilante group, Banda Civil has the feel of a support group, providing
members with an outlet from the daily fear that comes with life in Juarez. According to Guerra, over 300 people have
accompanied the group on searches and many of them are family members of missing women. And indeed, the searches
are a family activity.
On one recent Saturday, the search was joined by about 60 participants of all ages and from all sectors of Juarez society,
including a middle manager from the Lear Corp. There were no terrible discoveries that day, and yet afterward, as people
stood around talked and listened to norteno music blaring from a car stereo, it was evident just how deeply the murders
are ingrained into life here -- and how some people are fighting back with whatever tools they have at hand. Perhaps the
quiet optimism is derived from the age-old Mexican axiom that death brings about rebirth.
""Instead of spending our time criticizing the authorities, we're trying to find some solutions,"" says Santos. ""We all have
sisters and daughters here and we all feel the same. My daughter is in danger. I can't let her live like this.""

Germany in Need of a Dream
By JOHN KORNBLUM
Has Germany abandoned Europe? Do Angela Merkel's tough conditions for aid to Greece mean that Germany is no
longer the motor of European integration? Has Frau Merkel in fact morphed from the Miss Europa of 2007 to the Fraulein
Germania of 2010, as Germany's own former foreign minister Joschka Fischer has suggested?
As a former American ambassador who has lived arid worked the better part of four decades around Germany, my
Blackberry often glows red hot with messages from persons asking these questions. My response is always the same:
Germany has changed very little, but Europe and the world have changed a lot. Therein lies the dilemma.
Germany has worked hard to dig its way out of the disaster of 1945, but trauma remains a defining issue for German
society. Sixty five years later, Germany is still focused on the three essentials of its recovery: stability, respectability and
peace. Keep this triangle in mind and lots of things quickly come into focus.
From the first days of the Federal Republic. Germany's leaders emphasized the importance of defining interests solely
within a common European and Atlantic vocation. But they also understood that renouncing national ambitions did not
remove the responsibility to pursue specific German goals through the common institutions.
Many important postwar accomplishments were conceived and pushed by Germany, sometimes over the opposition of
others — including the United States. Ostpolitik was controversial for years, as was NATO enlargement. Germany pushed
them with determination.
Helmut Kohl did not consult before promulgating his 10 points on reunification. He agreed to French desires for a common
currency, but only if it could be a mirror of the Deutsche mark, for decades the European monetary standard. The euro
stability pact, now the object of so much controversy with Greece, was the result. After 1990, the E.U.'s eastward
expansion was Germany's way of firming up its Eastern flank.
Slowly and without fanfare, Germany has been remaking the European Union in its image. At each step of the way,
Germany made its wishes more palatable by paying more than its share. Part of today's misunderstanding is caused by
Germany's success in using its contributions to build an image of selflessness. Germany has been as single-minded in
pursuit of its goals as Charles de Gaulle ever was for his, but it almost always left leadership to others.
A new consciousness grew after the costs of reunification began to mount. ""Europe"" in the institutional sense has become
increasingly unpopular. German courts have begun to define German European issues in the context of the German
Constitution rather than on the basis of E.U. law. At least some of Ms. Merkel's refusal to allow immediate assistance to
Greece was based on her fears that it would fan anti-E.U. sentiment at home. Are these the first signs of a German Tea
Party?
Here we find the source of most of the hand wringing about Germany's role as the ""motor of Europe."" Ms. Merkel's
unwillingness to sweeten the financial pot echoed throughout Brussels. To many, it signified the decline of German
willingness to ""salute the French flag three times before raising the German flag,"" as Konrad Adenauer used to put it.
Germans are not alone in objecting to throwing more money into the E.U. pot, but they happen to be the only ones who
can do something about it. Many fear that without German complaisance, the E.U. will stutter to a stop. But such self-
denial could never offer a viable foundation for a new Europe. Neither could the inefficiency and even corruption that
characterizes many E.U. programs.
Most maddening for most thinking Europeans is the knowledge that the Germans are right. But to them, the question is
whether Germany is remaking the E.U. in a fashion palatable to the majority of other member states. They are not so sure
that its focus on stability and accountability is the right way to help such a diverse collection of peoples adjust to a
globalized world.
And so when Angela Merkel raps Greek knuckles, she is sending a message most Europeans don't want to hear. Not that
Germany is dangerous; even worse, that it is unrelenting. The Neue aricher Zeitung probably spoke for many others
when it once accused Germany of wanting Europe to become a large Switzerland.
The growing gap between Germany's aspirations and the perceived needs of other members of the E.U. is beginning to
burden both sides. Most Europeans are simply not ready to live up to German standards. Without a more flexible sense of
common purpose, the project to build a democratic Europe could stop dead in the water. But as Germans will themselves
often tell you: They have forgotten how to dream.
Younger Germans feel this lack of inspiration as well. Dreams were what 200,000 of them were waiting to hear when they
rallied to hear Barack Obama in Berlin two summers ago. They wanted more than to ""Dare to Hope,"" which is the
characteristically timid German translation of the title of the president's best seller. And they are still waiting. America
seems busy elsewhere.
The main conclusion I draw from the debate about Germany is that it is not about Germany at all. The task of building a
democratic Europe is far from complete. Most of the foundations have been laid and now the residents are starting to
haggle over the design. Weaving today's 27 states into a true trans-Atlantic partnership is a task that is too big for
Germany or even Europe to accomplish alone. They desperately need some skilled architectural assistance.
Uniting Europe and North America is the most audacious project ever conceived. If it works, the United States will be
joined by nearly 500 million Europeans to form a democratic space, within which modern democratic values will harness
more energy than in any single nation on earth. Democracy's future as the operating system for a globalized world will be
assured.
European fecklessness seems to worry Washington officials these days. But if Germany has forgotten how to dream and
the United States is too busy to try, we will both be guilty of perpetuating the aimlessness we so criticize. To hold up its
side of the bargain, Europe needs exactly what Barack Obama originally promised — the audacity of hope.

U.S. Revises Tack on Mideast Arms
Washington, Egypt Discuss Plan to Rid Region of Nuclear Weapons, in Effort to Steal Iran's Thunder at U.N. Conference
By JONATHAN WEISMAN, JAY SOLOMON and JOE LAURIA
The U.S. is negotiating with Egypt a proposal to make the Middle East a region free of nuclear weapons, as the U.S. seeks
to prevent Iran from derailing a monthlong U.N. conference on nuclear nonproliferation that begins Monday.
U.S. officials familiar with the move call it an important step in assuring countries that Washington—criticized by some
for its silence about Israel's undeclared nuclear arsenal—will equitably address weapons proliferation across the region, as
Iran seeks to shift focus away from its own nuclear program.
Washington also reassured Israel it won't foist a nuclear-free zone on the region until all parties agree to it and significant
progress has been made on Mideast peace.
The U.N. conference on the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which is held every five years, is expected to begin with a
bang Monday with an address by Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who has condemned the West for its refusal
to disarm and for tacitly accepting Israel's nuclear capability.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will follow the Iranian leader in the afternoon.
The U.N. talks come at a time when Iran is believed to be heading toward a nuclear capability and the U.S. and allies have
been pressing for new, tough Security Council sanctions to curb Tehran's program.
""The Iranians are clearly intending to spoil the party,"" said a senior U.S. official involved in the nuclear diplomacy. The
official highlighted the importance of raising Mideast nuclear-free zone issues.
The designation of the region as a zone free of weapons of mass destruction was a nonbinding agreement that emerged
from a 1995 U.N. review of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, a 1970 pact to limit the spread of nuclear weapons. That 1995
agreement was pivotal because it won the indefinite extension of the treaty, but no action on the zone has been taken
since.
Senior Obama administration officials said Friday the White House is willing to significantly advance a Mideast nuclear
weapons-free zone, and would support a conference on the subject at a future date. U.S. officials said talks with Egypt
would resume in New York in the coming month. Such a zone is envisaged to include Israel, the Arab states, Iran and
Turkey.
""We've made a proposal to them [Egypt] that goes beyond what the U.S. has been willing to do before,"" said the senior
U.S. official involved in the nuclear diplomacy.
U.S. officials stressed, however, that they didn't believe that would happen without first achieving major advances in
Arab-Israeli peace talks.
""We are concerned that the conditions are not right unless all members of the region participate, which would be unlikely
unless there is a comprehensive peace plan which is accepted,"" said Ellen Tauscher, undersecretary of state for arms
control and international security. She said the U.S. has also discussed the zone with the Arab League and other members
of the Nonaligned Movement.
The diplomacy could raise new tensions between President Barack Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu if Washington is seen backing away from its commitment to Israel. Israel has voiced concerns that the U.N.
conference could turn into an international forum to corner Israel. Mr. Netanyahu backed out of a nuclear-security
conference in Washington in March due to such concerns.
An Israeli official said Friday that his government supports a Middle East freeze of WMD and nuclear weapons, but that
""it should be the culmination of a process that begins with bilateral and individual peace agreements between all the
countries in the region.""
The U.S. and Israel have been locked in a monthslong spat over Mr. Obama's calls for a complete freeze in building new
Jewish housing in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. U.S. officials have grown increasingly confident in recent days that
ties between the U.S. and Israel have stabilized. Mrs. Clinton said Friday that the Mideast peace process will get on track
next week, though not the U.S.-brokered direct talks involving Israeli and Palestinians that the Obama administration
wants to see.
Egypt's latest proposal calls for Israel's disarmament ""as soon as possible."" It also called for Israel's nuclear program to be
placed under the auspices of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N.'s atomic watchdog. That proposal won't
be accepted, U.S. officials said.
The Egyptian working paper demands NPT signatory states release ""all information available to them on the nature and
scope of Israeli nuclear facilities and activities, including information pertaining to previous nuclear transfers to Israel.""
U.S. officials indicated no such demands could be made on Israel.
Arms-control analysts familiar with the talks say the U.S. is likely to propose creating a U.N. envoy given the task of
calling a conference of Middle East nations to press forward on the nuclear weapon-free zone.
""They are desperate to buy off Egyptian objections,"" said Henry Sokolski, executive director of the Non-Proliferation
Education Center and a critic of the Obama administration's arms-control approach.
Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, an advocacy group, said the U.S. acceptance of a
special envoy is a significant shift. A U.S. official refused to say whether the envoy proposal, first floated by Russia, was
part of the U.S. offer.
The last NPT conference in 2005 ended in collapse. But U.S. officials said they have been laying the groundwork for this
conference for nearly a year.
The White House wants rules to ensure that a country that withdraws from the treaty doesn't escape inspections and
sanctions. They also want more power for U.N. inspectors and more backing for multinational facilities that could help
nations develop peaceful nuclear power.

Lugar: No more money for development banks until reform
Posted By Josh Rogin Wednesday, March 10, 2010
In the wake of the global financial crisis, a slew of multinational development banks are asking for large amounts of new
capital to both replenish and in some cases expand their resource pools, and much of the burden will fall on the United
States.
This creates a unique opportunity for the Obama administration to press these organizations to implement long-awaited
reforms, according to the Senate's top Republican on foreign relations, who has a big say in whether and how the
Congress doles out the funds.
""As the world struggles to emerge from the worst economic crisis since World War II, it is an appropriate time to ask
whether the [International Financial Institutions] are performing optimally and doing the jobs they should be doing,""
reads a newly released report by the staff of Sen. Richard Lugar, R-IN, ""The crisis should not be used as an excuse to win
increases that could not otherwise be justified. As the requests for capital are negotiated with the international donor
community, there is a window of opportunity for significant reform.""
The report, which is the culmination of six years of research, including half a dozen hearings when Lugar was committee
chairman, outlines several dozen recommendations for what the Obama administration, Congress, and the banks can do
to update their relevance.
""Does the world really need the IMF, World Bank, African Development Bank, Asian Development Bank, European Bank
for Reconstruction and Development, and Inter-American Development Bank today? Can they be changed to better
address our needs? How should we re-design them?"" the report asks.
""Such questions are particularly timely because nearly all the IFIs have sought, or will soon seek, major new infusions of
money from their donors, including the taxpayers of the United States.""
The Asian Development Bank has already asked the Obama administration for new funds, and the administration has
requested in its new budget $533 million in direct money and $12.8 billion in borrowing authority for the ADB.
A committee staffer told The Cable that Lugar wants to see progress on reform before he would support authorizing the
money.
""We want to make sure that before the American taxpayer puts more money in there that things are fixed,"" the staffer
said. ""It's not possible for them to do everything, but they could certainly make progress.""
The reforms the administration could press for in the short term include pressing the banks to focus more on
development goals rather than the structure and size of loans and ""work with the other donor countries to step back
and slow down the process,"" the staffer said.
Congress is also concerned that the Obama administration might not be interested in pressing for these reforms,
considering that Obama issued a signing statement in June indicating he did not feel bound to follow congressional
direction on such international negotiations.
Negotiations between several banks and the Treasury Department are ongoing. The U.S. side is led by Scott Morris,
deputy assistant secretary of the Treasury's Office of International Development Finance and Debt.
The issue will next surface at the end of March when the Inter-American Development Bank convenes its annual
meeting in Cancun.

4707,"Re: Expo UpdateI have asked Jose to get you a more detailed report but I.must tell you the opening of the USA Pavilion has been a great
success so far - at least among the expo-goers. A few vignettes.
- while we don't want to brag to our Chinese hosts, our Pavilion has become the most popular. During the trial runs last
week, the Chinese expo-goers rushed directly from the gates to the USAP (and even broke some of our turn-styles).
Needless to say, the Chinese have improved security. On EACH of the first two days, 30,000 pple visited. Lines are long
and pple are loving the show. We are also getting many foreign officials to visit.
-the 100 US college student ambassadors (who act as guides and speak Mandarin) are the biggest hits of the pavilion.
Fair-goers stand in line to have their photo's taken w them. They explain the show and send a great message.
- the story line that we thght was simplistic is quite popular (the overture where Americans try to say hello in mandarin
is met w howls of laughter and Act ll called the Garden is doing well). During the thunderstorm scene a mist comes from
the ceiling and some pple put up their umbrellas. Act I is a bit too commercial but the audience claps and take photo's
when you and President come on the screen.
- we are selling tons of USA merchandise - the two most popular items - mini-basketballs with the USAP seal on it and
the bison stuffed animals - who knew?
Anyway, thght u'd enjoy the quick report. I cannot imagine us not being here! We will keep you posted.

From Gary Sick
Mojtaba Samareh Hashemi is a senior adviser to President Ahmadinejad and a devoted proponent of the Divine Right of
Kings doctrine of ultra-conservative ayatollah Mesbah-Yazdi. Many regard him as an eminence grise of the Iranian regime
and an important bridge between the Revolutionary Guards, the fanatic-fringe ayatollahs, and the presidency. So his
words are worth listening to as clues to what is happening inside the closed circles of the Iranian leadership.
Today he was quoted by the Fars news agency (in Persian) on the troublesome issue of U.S.-Iran relations. Although the
statement was translated into English, it needs more than a word-for-word translation in order to be understood. So I have
added my own interpretation of what Mojtaba really meant to say.
""Obama not only did not manage to realize his slogan [of change], but has pursued the dark policies of Bush all over the
world ever more energetically...""
[real meaning: Oh, how we miss George Bush! He was such an easy target. With him we were winning everywhere and
America's credibility was falling to the point of disappearance even among its friends.]
""The Bush presidency is one of the darkest eras of the United States and the greatest hatred emerged internationally
towards the United States...""
[Why can't Obama be more like Bush? In the good old days we didn't have to keep answering questions about why we
would not accept an outstretched hand of friendship. It was all so much easier then.]
""Today we see that the United States rather than moving its military forces out of Iraq and Afghanistan has increased their
number which has led to mass murder of the people and increased impoverishment in these countries. Obama had said
that he wanted to oppose violation of human rights and wanted to close Guantanamo and secret prisons in Europe. Did
this happen? Of course not...""
[The United States has announced its withdrawal from Iraq and actually seems to be on schedule; in the meantime, our
favorite parties and politicians in Iraq have not done all that well in the Iraqi elections despite our support. The Shi'i
religious leaders in Najaf openly dismiss the idea of an Islamic Republic and are increasingly competing with us, instead
of following our lead. In Afghanistan, the Americans seem to be serious about announcing a date certain for withdrawal,
and they even seem to be edging up to a Karzai reconciliation strategy with the Taliban. How can we attack them with a
straight face when they behave this way!]
""There has also not been any correction of the dark policy of Bush towards Iran's nuclear program or [the United State's]
opposition towards the Iranian nation...""
[Their willingness to meet with us and that dastardly offer of a uranium swap were hugely embarrassing. Now every time
we sit down with a foreign leader we have to listen to tiresome suggestions that we should reconsider our position on the
uranium swap — even from the Russians and Chinese. You can't trust anyone these days!]
""We do not want anything from the United States. The Iranian nation demands its rights to be recognized and
respected...""
[All we want from the Americans is the return of George Bush! Even John McCain would be an improvement. I wonder if
Sarah Palin has any chance? We'll keep our fingers crossed.]
""The Islamic Republic has not become isolated, rather, it is expanding [its foreign relations] ever more and is finding new
friends... if they have claims, they must show it in their actions so the Iranian nation gradually trusts them...""
[We have never been so alone since the earliest years of the revolution. Even dictators and police states are privately
expressing sympathy to us for the way our crackdown on the Green Movement attracted sympathetic attention all over the
world. And it's all the fault of that *&!*Obama and the %$#! internet. The shah never had all these problems. Ah, for the
good old days...]","['Iran', 'America', 'United', 'States', 'United', 'States', 'United', 'States', 'Iraq', 'Afghanistan', 'Guantanamo', 'Europe', 'United', 'States', 'Iraq', 'Iraq', 'Najaf', 'Islamic', 'Republic', 'Afghanistan', 'Iran', 'United', 'States', 'Islamic', 'Republic']"

Re: Oil spill
I'm not
For a few reasons
First, calmness is not such a bad thing in these moments. Calm is not cavalier, which you weren't
Second, you're not the EPA administrator or Interior Secretary - nobody will see you as a front line cabinet officer on this
Third, if this is still out of control on Sunday, the administration has bigger problems
So I'm really not worried.
Here it is again which might allay your concerns
SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, David, I think that the President has ordered the departments that deal with this —
Homeland Security, Interior, Environmental Protection, Defense — to all immediately not only do everything possible to
mitigate the effects of this spill, but to try to come up with recommendations going forward. The first order of business,
however, is to try to get this spill under control, which has been, as you know, very difficult, and to prevent further
damage to the coastline along Louisiana to the fishing waters, to the wildlife. I think it does raise questions which the
President has said have to be answered. He put forth a very comprehensive approach that included the potential of
drilling off of our own shores. That is a national security concern because we have to do better to lessen our
dependence on foreign oil. But it has to be done safely. It can't be done at the risk of having to spend billions of dollars
cleaning up these spills. So as with so much in these difficult areas, it's going to require a balancing act.",['Louisiana']

H: Haaretz chief columnist on Bibi's visit. Sid
htto://www. haaretz.com/hasers/spagesil 158992. html
Aluf Benn / Netanyahu leaves U.S. disgraced, isolated and weaker
By Ake Berm
Details emerging from Benjamin Netanyahu's visit to Washington remain incomplete, but the conclusion may nonetheless
be drawn that the prime minister erred in choosing to fly to the United States this week. The visit - touted as a fence-
mending effort, a bid to strengthen the tenuous ties between Netanyahu and U.S. President Barack Obama - only
highlighted the deep rift between the American and Israeli administrations.
The prime minister leaves America disgraced, isolated, and altogether weaker than when he came.
Instead of setting the diplomatic agenda, Netanyahu surrendered control over it. Instead of leaving the Palestinian issue
aside and focusing on Iran, as he would like, Netanyahu now finds himself fighting for the legitimacy of Israeli control over
East Jerusalem.
Advertisement
The most sensitive and insoluble core issues - those which when raised a decade ago led to the dissolution of
the peace process and explosion of the second intifada - are now being served as a mere appetizer.
At the start of his visit, Netanyahu was tempted to bask in the warm welcome he received at the AIPAC conference, at
which he gave his emotional address on Jerusalem.
Taking a page from Menachem Begin, he spoke not on behalf of the State of Israel, but in the name of the Jewish people
itself and its millennia of history.
His speech was not radical rightist rhetoric. Reading between the lines, one could spot a certain willingness to relinquish
West Bank settlements as long as Israel maintains a security buffer in the Jordan Valley.
But at the White House, the prime minister's speech to thousands of pro-Israel activists and hundreds of cheering
congressmen looked like an obvious attempt to raise political capital against the American president.
Knowing Netanyahu would be reenergized by his speech at the lobby, Obama and his staff set him a honey trap. Over the
weekend they sought to quell the row that flared up during U.S. Vice President Joe Biden's trip here two weeks ago, and
U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton described Netanyahu's response to the ultimatums Washington presented to him
as ""useful.""
Special envoy George Mitchell made a televised visit to the prime minister's bureau Sunday to invite Netanyahu to the
White House. Washington, it seemed, was trying to make nice.
Far from it. Just when Netanyahu thought he had resolved the crisis by apologizing to Biden, Clinton called him up for a
dressing down.
This time as well, Netanyahu almost believed the crisis had passed, that he had survived by offering partial. noncommittal
answers to the Americans' questions. Shortly before meeting with Obama, Netanyahu even warned the Palestinians that
should they continue to demand a freeze on construction, he would postpone peace talks by a year.
His arrogant tone underscored the fact that Netanyahu believed that on the strength of his AIPAC speech, he could call
the next few steps of the diplomatic dance.
But then calamity struck. At their White House meeting, Obama made clear to his guest that the letter Netanyahu had
sent was insufficient and returned it for further corrections. Instead of a reception as a guest of honor, Netanyahu was
treated as a problem child, an army private ordered to do laps around the base for slipping up at roll call.
The revolution in the Americans' behavior is clear to all. On Sunday morning Obama was still anxiously looking ahead to
the House of Representatives vote on health care - the last thing he wanted was a last-minute disagreement with
congressmen over ties with Israel.
The moment the bill was passed, however, a victorious Obama was free to deal with his unruly guest.
The Americans made every effort to downplay the visit. As during his last visit in November, Netanyahu was invited to the
White House at a late hour, without media coverage or a press conference. If that were not enough, the White House
spokesman challenged Netanyahu's observation at AIPAC that ""Jerusalem is not a settlement.""
The Americans didn't even wait for him to leave Washington to make their disagreement known. It was not the behavior
Washington shows an ally, but the kind it shows an annoyance.
The approval of construction at the Shepherd Hotel in Sheikh Jarrah, announced before his meeting with Obama, again
caught Netanyahu unawares. Apparently the special panel appointed after the Ramat Shlomo debacle to prevent such
surprises failed its first test.
Netanyahu is having his most difficult week since returning to office, beginning with the unfortunate decision to relocate
the planned emergency room at Ashkelon's Barzilai Medical Center and lasting through his humiliating jaunt through
Washington.
Returning to Israel today, Netanyahu will need to work hard to rehabilitate his image, knowing full well that Obama will not
relent, but instead demand that he stop zigzagging and decide, once and for all, whether he stands with America or with
the settlers.","['U.S.', 'Washington', 'United', 'States', 'U.S.', 'America', 'Iran', 'East', 'Jerusalem', 'Jerusalem', 'Israel', 'West', 'Bank', 'Israel', 'Jordan', 'Valley', 'White', 'House', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'Washington', 'Washington', 'White', 'House', 'Israel', 'Jerusalem', 'Washington', 'Washington', 'Shepherd', 'Hotel', 'Ashkelon', 'Barzilai', 'Medical', 'Center', 'Washington', 'Israel', 'America']"

4814,"Jerry, as you may recall, was Guiliani's homeland security guy in NYC and became B6
one of the world's experts. He also worked for Clinton Admn and helped with disaster relief (including earthquakes)
around the world. He called me today with some suggestions (some of which may be moot), so I asked him to put them
into a memo. Here it is, for what it's worth:
I think the fundamental issue is that no one seems to be in charge and no
one person has been tasked with trying to pull all of the pieces together
into a short term and long term plan. Obviously in the short term, search
and rescue and food and water are the main priorities. There seems to be
little communication between the various areas where people have congregated
and a central command post where agencies can call or radio for additional
supplies including food, water and medical.
I don't recommend DoD be put in charge of this. They rarely have the kind of
touch that brings together all the necessary agencies under one roof. I
would set up a central command that has representatives from all federal
agencies in one place. There is no reason things should be this
disorganized. I would break the island into grids and assign one person to
be the coordinator for each of the grids. That person will be responsible
for all activities within their grid and will report activities to the
island on-scene coordinator. We should get a radio company like Motorola to
set up temporary towers and give the State Department several hundred radios
so everyone involved in the response is able to communicate with the command
post and with each other.
I think one of the most important roles for DoD is to provide security for
the rescue teams and medical teams. They also should be responsible for the
operation of the airport, for off loading planes and for scheduling all
incoming flights so there is no lost time waiting for planes to land. I also
think DoD should be responsible for airlifting supplies that are requested
by each one of the grid coordinators. Additionally, the helicopters should
be used to move critical patients to the hospital ship on the way and to the
aircraft carrier currently on station. At least once a day, the coordinator
assigned by the President and the Secretary of State should be responsible
for getting situation reports from all agencies on site, particularly
regarding food and water, security, medical and search and rescue.
The lack of command and control is allowing the situation to become more
chaotic rather than more coordinated. I believe that if the Secretary were
to talk to the other nations involved through the UN, they would be
supportive of better coordination.
Bottom line is that there is no order to the operation and you need strong
people in there who can speak on behalf of the President and the Secretary
and get things under control quickly.
I hope this is helpful. If you or the Secretary have any questions please
feel free to call me on my cell We leave for Tokyo at 7:15 am
tomorrow and transfer to a United flight due back in DC at 2:30 pm tomorrow.
Please give the Secretary my best regards. I hope to see you soon.

Statement by the Secretary
Murders in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico
Today the men and women of the Department of State are mourning the murder of three people connected to the
United States Consulate General in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico. One American consulate employee was killed along with her
husband, and the husband of a Mexican employee was also killed. I offer my deepest sympathies to the family, loved
ones and colleagues of these victims. The safety and security of our personnel and their families in Mexico and at posts
around the world is always our highest priority. I have spoken with our Ambassador in Mexico and we are working with
the Government of Mexico to do everything necessary to protect our people and to ensure that the perpetrators of
these horrendous acts are brought to justice.
These appalling assaults on members of our own State Department family are, sadly, part of a growing tragedy besetting
many communities in Mexico. They underscore the imperative of our continued commitment to work closely with the
Government of President Calderon to cripple the influence of trafficking organizations at work in Mexico. This is a
responsibility we must shoulder together, particularly in border communities where strong bonds of history, culture,
and common interest bind the Mexican and the American people closely together.","['Ciudad', 'Juarez', 'Mexico', 'United', 'States', 'Ciudad', 'Juarez', 'Mexico', 'Mexico', 'Mexico', 'Mexico', 'Mexico', 'Mexico']"

The Petraeus briefing: Biden's embarrassment
is not the whole story
Posted By Mark Perry 4Saturday, March 13, 2010 -
On Jan. 16, two days after a killer earthquake hit Haiti, a team of senior military officers from the U.S. Central Command
(responsible for overseeing American security interests in the Middle East), arrived at the Pentagon to brief Joint Chiefs of
Staff Chairman Adm. Michael Mullen on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The team had been dispatched by CENTCOM
commander Gen. David Petraeus to underline his growing worries at the lack of progress in resolving the issue. The 33-
slide, 45-minute PowerPoint briefing stunned Mullen. The briefers reported that there was a growing perception among
Arab leaders that the U.S. was incapable of standing up to Israel, that CENTCOM's mostly Arab constituency was losing
faith in American promises, that Israeli intransigence on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was jeopardizing U.S. standing in
the region, and that Mitchell himself was (as a senior Pentagon officer later bluntly described it) ""too old, too slow ... and
too late.""
The January Mullen briefing was unprecedented. No previous CENTCOM commander had ever expressed himself on
what is essentially a political issue; which is why the briefers were careful to tell Mullen that their conclusions followed
from a December 2009 tour of the region where, on Petraeus's instructions, they spoke to senior Arab leaders.
""Everywhere they went, the message was pretty humbling,"" a Pentagon officer familiar with the briefing says. ""America
was not only viewed as weak, but its military posture in the region was eroding."" But Petraeus wasn't finished: two days
after the Mullen briefing, Petraeus sent a paper to the White House requesting that the West Bank and Gaza (which, with
Israel, is a part of the European Command -- or EUCOM), be made a part of his area of operations. Petraeus's reason
was straightforward: with U.S. troops deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan, the U.S. military had to be perceived by Arab
leaders as engaged in the region's most troublesome conflict.
[UPDATE: A senior military officer denied Sunday that Petraeus sent a paper to the White House.
""CENTCOM did have a team brief the CJCS on concerns revolving around the Palestinian issue, and CENTCOM did
propose a UCP change, but to CJCS, not to the WH,"" the officer said via email. ""GEN Petraeus was not certain what
might have been conveyed to the WH (if anything) from that brief to CJCS.""
(UCP means ""unified combatant command,"" like CENTCOM; CJCS refers to Mullen; and WH is the White House.)]
The Mullen briefing and Petraeus's request hit the White House like a bombshell. While Petraeus's request that
CENTCOM be expanded to include the Palestinians was denied (""it was dead on arrival,"" a Pentagon officer confirms),
the Obama administration decided it would redouble its efforts -- pressing Israel once again on the settlements issue,
sending Mitchell on a visit to a number of Arab capitals and dispatching Mullen for a carefully arranged meeting with the
chief of the Israeli General Staff, Lt. General Gabi Ashkenazi. While the American press speculated that Mullen's trip
focused on Iran, the JCS Chairman actually carried a blunt, and tough, message on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict: that
Israel had to see its conflict with the Palestinians ""in a larger, regional, context"" -- as having a direct impact on America's
status in the region. Certainly, it was thought, Israel would get the message.
Israel didn't. When Vice President Joe Biden was embarrassed by an Israeli announcement that the Netanyahu
government was building 1,600 new homes in East Jerusalem, the administration reacted. But no one was more outraged
than Biden who, according to the Israeli daily Yedioth Ahronoth, engaged in a private, and angry, exchange with the
Israeli Prime Minister. Not surprisingly, what Biden told Netanyahu reflected the importance the administration attached to
Petraeus's Mullen briefing: ""This is starting to get dangerous for us,"" Biden reportedly told Netanyahu. ""What you're doing
here undermines the security of our troops who are fighting in Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan. That endangers us and it
endangers regional peace."" Yedioth Ahronoth went on to report: ""The vice president told his Israeli hosts that since many
people in the Muslim world perceived a connection between Israel's actions and US policy, any decision about
construction that undermines Palestinian rights in East Jerusalem could have an impact on the personal safety of
American troops fighting against Islamic terrorism."" The message couldn't be plainer: Israel's intransigence could cost
American lives.
There are important and powerful lobbies in America: the NRA, the American Medical Association, the lawyers -- and the
Israeli lobby. But no lobby is as important, or as powerful, as the U.S. military. While commentators and pundits might
reflect that Joe Biden's trip to Israel has forever shifted America's relationship with its erstwhile ally in the region, the real
break came in January, when David Petraeus sent a briefing team to the Pentagon with a stark warning: America's
relationship with Israel is important, but not as important as the lives of America's soldiers. Maybe Israel gets the message
now.

http://warincontext.org/2olo/o3/14/israel-is-putting-american-liyes-at-risk/
My piece on the briefing of Admiral Mullen by CENTCOM senior officers has occasioned a great deal of comment, as
well as some skepticism: how accurate is the account? Was it told to me by direct participants in the briefing? Is
there any basis for imagining that Petraeus has any kind of hidden agenda, whether that is a desire to expand
CENTCOM — or even hostility towards Israel.
I won't name my sources, even though it's clear to people in the Pentagon — and certainly to General Petraeus — who
they are. Was I told of the briefing by the briefers themselves? I will only say that there were four people in the
briefing — the two briefers, Admiral Mullen, and Admiral Mullen's primary adviser on the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict. I know two of the people involved in the briefing. Whether or not they are my sources is something for the
reader to determine. The account is not only accurate, it's a precis of what actually happened. There is a lot more to
it. The White House, State Department and Pentagon have not denied the account, and for good reason: it's true.
Is there any basis for imagining that Petraeus has any kind of hidden agenda in ordering the briefing?
I have been reporting on the American military for thirty years. My work on the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Four Stars, is
the authoritative account on the subject. I have deeply rooted contacts in the military that go back thirty years. I
have never met a senior military officer whom I do not admire. There is no greater insult than to believe that General
Petraeus or any other senior American military officer would use the lives of American soldiers as a lever to enhance
their own political future. My sense is that General Petraeus neither likes nor dislikes Israel: but he loves his country
and he wants to protect our soldiers. The current crisis in American relations with Israel is not a litmus test of
General Petraeus's loyalty to Israel, but of his, and our, concern for those Americans in uniform in the Middle East.
It is, perhaps, a sign of the depth of ""the Biden crisis"" that every controversy of this type seems to get translated into
whether or not America and its leaders are committed to Israel's security. This isn't about Israel's security, it's about
our security.

Netanyahu and Pastor Hagee's Lovefest on Eve of Biden's
Arrival in Israel
On 03.09.10, By Max
(Videos recorded by Rachel Tabachnick; more videos coming shortly.)
Vice President Joe Biden was greeted in Jerusalem with the announcement that the Israeli Interior Ministry approved the
construction of 1600 new homes in Occupied East Jerusalem contrary to U.S. wishes and complicating Biden's mission to
help jump start the peace process. But Biden should have known that Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu intended to upset his
plans by Netanyahu's appearance with John Hagee.
The day after a series of talks between US Special Envoy for the Middle East George Mitchell and Netanyahu, and a day
before Biden's arrival, Netanyahu appeared onstage with Pastor John Hagee in Jerusalem. The occasion was Hagee's
Night To Honor Israel, an event the far-right Texas-based preacher arranged to tout his ministry's millions in donations to
Israeli organizations and to level bellicose rhetoric against Israel's perceived enemies.
At the gathering, Hagee called Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ""the Hitler of the Middle East"" and denounced
the Goldstone Report as ""character assassination by an unbiased and uninformed committee.""
Netanyahu welcomed the crowd of 1000 American evangelicals to Jerusalem, a city he described as ""the undivided,
eternal capitol of the Jewish people. Then, he told them, ""I salute you! The Jewish people salute you!"" He used the rest of
his speech to call for ""tough, biting sanctions"" against Iran that ""bite deep into its energy sector.""
Hagee and Netanyahu appear together on stage:

In the audience were top-level members of the Israeli government, from Ambassador Michael Oren to Jerusalem Mayor
Nir Barkat to Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon. Also present was Rabbi Shlomo Riskin, the chief rabbi of the illegal
West Bank settlement of Efrat who gained notoriety for lobbying President Bill Clinton to pardon his friend, fugitive
billionaire Marc Rich. Ayalon had stirred controversy days before when he refused to meet with a US congressional
delegation brought to Israel by the progressive Jewish group J Street.
Part One of Hagee's speech:

Hagee's ceremony featured a 15-minute film highlighting the recipients of donations from John Hagee Ministries that
totaled $58 million since 2001. The recipients included Jewish settlements from the West Bank like Gush Etzion and
Shomron, which was involved in promoting an ""Obama Hilltop project"" that promoted more settlement building and
compared Obama to Pharoah. Hagee also announced funding for a pressure group run by the settlers evacuated from
Gush Katif in Gaza in 2005. During Israel's assault on Gaza in 2009, a group of Gush Katif residents lobbied the Israel
government to allow them to resettle the Palestinian coastal region.
Who is Hagee funding in Israel?
X
Who Is Haoee Funding In Israel? from Max Blumenthal on Vimeo.
The most notable of Hagee's funding recipients was an organization called Im Tirtzu. A student representative of this
group appeared in the film to thank Hagee for ""help[ing] us to ensure that students in Israel are on the right path, the path
of Zionism, the love of Israel, the path of solidarity."" Another student called for ""the second revolution in Israel.""
In February, Im Tirtzu funding a smear campaign against former Knesset member and New Israel Fund Director Naomi
Chazan that included posters caricaturing her with a horn on her head. The group misleadingly accused the New Israel
Fund of bankrolling 16 human rights organizations that contributed documentation to the Goldstone Report.
The smear campaign led to unsuccessful legislation in the Knesset designed to further cripple already marginalized Israeli
human rights groups. Meanwhile, the Jerusalem Post fired Chazan as a columnist without explanation. Gideon Levy, a
columnist for Ha'aretz, called Im Tirtzu ""a McCarthyite movement"" for its attacks on Chazan.
Although CUFI attempted to distance itself from Im Tirtzu's campaign, the organization's appearance during CUFI's
Jerusalem ceremony suggested that Hagee would continue to provide it with funding well into the future.
Republican Senator John McCain repudiated the endorsement of Hagee during his 2008 presidential campaign after
Hagee's statements describing the Holocaust as a fulfillment of divine prophecy came to light. Hagee has also said that
he believed the anti-Christ was ""partially Jewish, as was Adolph Hitler."" However, none of Hagee's comments have
deterred Israeli government officials from embracing him or accepting his millions in annual charity.
During Hagee's speech, he made no secret of his support for the illegal settlement enterprise that has been the source of
difficulties between the US and Israel. ""The settlements are not the problem,"" he boomed from the podium. ""The problem
is the refusal of Arab leaders to respect the right of Jewish people to live anywhere in the Middle East.""
Hagee received a rousing ovation from the crowd and the Israeli government officials seated beside the podium when he
proclaimed, ""World leaders do not have the authority to tell Israel and the Jewish people what they can and cannot do in
the city of Jerusalem. They don't have the authority to tell them what they can and cannot build, who can and and cannot
live there.""
The following day, on March 9, Vice President Joseph Biden arrived in Israel to meet with Netanyahu and officials from
the Palestinian Authority. He told reporters after touching down that he saw ""a moment of real opportunity.""","['Israel', 'Haiti', 'Middle', 'East', ')', 'U.S.', 'Israel', 'U.S.', 'America', 'West', 'Bank', 'Gaza', 'Israel', 'U.S.', 'Iraq', 'Afghanistan', 'U.S.', 'White', 'House', 'Israel', 'Iran', 'Israel', 'Israel', 'Israel', 'East', 'Jerusalem', 'Iraq', 'Afghanistan', 'Pakistan', 'Israel', 'US', 'East', 'Jerusalem', 'Israel', 'America', 'U.S.', 'Israel', 'America', 'Israel', 'America', 'Israel', 'Israel', 'Israel', 'Israel', 'Israel', 'Middle', 'East', 'America', 'Israel', 'Israel', 'Israel', 'Jerusalem', 'Occupied', 'East', 'Jerusalem', 'U.S.', 'US', 'Middle', 'East', 'Jerusalem', 'Israel', 'Israel', 'Middle', 'East', 'Jerusalem', 'Iran', 'Jerusalem', 'West', 'Bank', 'Efrat', 'US', 'Israel', 'Jerusalem', 'West', 'Bank', 'Obama', 'Hilltop', 'Gaza', 'Israel', 'Gaza', 'Israel', 'Israel', 'Israel', 'Israel', 'Israel', 'Israel', 'Jerusalem', 'US', 'Israel', 'Middle', 'East', 'Israel', 'Jerusalem', 'Israel']"

It's over: MPs say the special relationship with
S is dead
Winston Churchill, Franklin D Roosevelt and Josef Stalin
Michael Smith
BRITAIN'S special relationship with the US forged by Winston Churchill and Franklin Roosevelt in the second world
war -- no longer exists, says a committee of influential MPs.
Instead, America's relationship with Britain is no more special than with its other main allies, according to a report by the
Commons foreign affairs committee published today.
The report also warns that the perception of the UK after the Iraq war as America's ""subservient poodle"" has been highly
damaging to Britain's reputation and interests around the world. The MPs conclude that British prime ministers have to
learn to be less deferential to US presidents and be ""willing to say no"" to America.
The report, entitled Global Security: UK-US Relations, says Britain's relationship with America is ""extremely close and
valuable"" in a number of areas, particularly intelligence co-operation. However, it adds that the use of the phrase special
relationship, in its historical sense, ""is potentially misleading and we recommend that its use should be avoided"".
It does not reflect the ""ever-evolving"" relationship between the two countries and raises unrealistic expectations, the MPs
say.
""Over the longer term, the UK is unlikely to be able to influence the US to the extent it has in the past,"" the committee
adds.
In an apparent rebuke to Tony Blair and his relationship with President George W Bush, the report says there are ""many
lessons"" to be learnt from Britain's political approach towards the US over Iraq.
""The perception that the British government was a subservient poodle to the US administration is widespread both among
the British public and overseas,"" the MPs say. ""This perception, whatever its relation to reality, is deeply damaging to the
reputation and interests of the UK.""
While the relationship between the American president and the British prime minister was an important part of dealings
between the two countries, the cabinet and parliament also had a role to play. ""The UK needs to be less deferential and
more willing to say no to the US on those issues where the two countries' interests and values diverge,"" the MPs say.
They are also critical of the US use of extraordinary rendition and torture. The report calls for a comprehensive review of
the use by the CIA of British bases, such as that on the Indian Ocean island of Diego Garcia, to carry out extraordinary
rendition.
""The issues relating to rendition through Diego Garcia to which we have previously drawn attention raise disturbing
questions about the uses to which US bases on British territory are put"", the MPs say.
They express regret at ""considerable restraints"" on the ability of both the government and parliament to scrutinise US
activities carried out on British territory.
""We recommend that the government should establish a comprehensive review of the current arrangements governing
US military use of facilities within the UK and in British overseas territories."" The review should ""identify shortcomings in
the current system of scrutiny and oversight ... and report to parliament on proposals to remedy these"".
The report also demands a statement from the government on the implications of the Court of Appeal judgment regarding
the alleged collusion of MI5 in the torture of Binyam Mohamed, a British resident.
Last month the court ordered the government to release evidence from American intelligence reports which showed that
MI5 was aware of the torture.
Senior US officials subsequently suggested that releasing such evidence might prevent the US from sharing some
intelligence with Britain.

reiterates its call for a solution that addresses Israel's legitimate security concerns, including an end to weapons
smuggling into Gaza; promotes Palestinian unity based on the Palestine Liberation Organization commitments and the
reunification of Gaza and the West Bank under the legitimate Palestinian Authority; and ensures the unimpeded flow of
humanitarian aid, commercial goods and persons to and from Gaza, consistent with United Nations Security Council
resolution 1860 (2009). The Quartet declares its readiness to work closely with Israel, the Palestinian Government and
international donors in order to achieve sustainable economic development on the basis of the full implementation of
the Agreement on Access and Movement of 2005 and in the broader perspective of the two-state solution.
Consistent with these objectives, the Quartet and the Quartet Representative have worked with Israel, as well as
consulting the Palestinian Authority, Egypt, and other concerned parties, to effect a fundamental change in policy in
Gaza. The new policy towards Gaza just announced by the Government of Israel is a welcome development. The Quartet
notes that the elaboration of further details and modalities of implementation will be important in ensuring the
effectiveness of the new policy. Full and effective implementation will comprise a significant shift in strategy towards
meeting the needs of Gaza's population for humanitarian and commercial goods, civilian reconstruction and
infrastructure, and legitimate economic activity as well as the security needs of Israel. The Quartet will continue to work
with Israel, the Palestinian Authority, and other concerned parties to ensure these arrangements are implemented as
quickly as possible. The Quartet affirms that much work remains to achieve fully the solution stated above, and, in
consultation with the concerned parties, it will monitor closely the implementation of the policy in all its aspects. It will
actively explore additional ways to improve the situation in Gaza, encourage involvement of the PA at the crossings and
promote greater commerce between the West Bank and Gaza.
The Quartet stresses the importance of United Nations and other international interventions, as well as the work of local
non-governmental organizations, to be expanded in Gaza to meet urgent civilian needs, and calls on all parties to fully
enable this work.
The Quartet recognizes that Israel has legitimate security concerns that must continue to be safeguarded, and believes
efforts to maintain security while enabling movement and access for Palestinian people and goods are critical. The
Quartet commits to work with Israel and the international community to prevent the illicit trafficking of arms and
ammunition into Gaza. It urges all those wishing to deliver goods to do so through established channels so that their
cargo can be inspected and transferred via land crossings into Gaza. The Quartet emphasizes that there is no need for
unnecessary confrontations and calls on all parties to act responsibly in meeting the needs of the people of Gaza.
The Quartet also calls for an end to the deplorable detention of Gilad Shalit in advance of the fourth anniversary of his
capture on June 25; it further condemns the violation of Hamas' international obligation to provide him access by the
International Committee of the Red Cross and demands that Hamas immediately remedy the situation.
The Quartet also reiterates its support for proximity talks toward the resumption, without pre-conditions, of direct
bilateral negotiations that resolve all final status issues as previously agreed by the parties. The Quartet believes these
negotiations should lead to a settlement, negotiated between the parties within 24 months, that ends the occupation
which began in 1967 and results in the emergence of an independent, democratic, and viable Palestinian state in the
West Bank and Gaza, living side by side in peace and security with Israel and its other neighbours.","['Gaza', 'Israel', 'Gaza', 'Gaza', 'West', 'Bank', 'Gaza', 'Israel', 'Israel', 'Egypt', 'Gaza', 'Gaza', 'Israel', 'Gaza', 'Israel', 'Israel', 'Gaza', 'West', 'Bank', 'Gaza', 'Gaza', 'Israel', 'Israel', 'Gaza', 'Gaza', 'Gaza', 'West', 'Bank', 'Gaza', 'Israel']"

Recruit Afghan women to sell war to Europeans: CIA report
WASHINGTON, March 27, 2010 (AFP) - A CIA expert has called for recruiting Afghan women in a public
relations bid to persuade skeptical Europeans to support the NATO-led war effort, according to a document
leaked Friday.
""Afghan women could serve as ideal messengers in humanizing"" the mission for European audiences,
particularly in France, according to the CIA analysis, posted on WikiLeaks, a whistleblower website.
The views of Afghan women would carry special weight as they could express ""their aspirations for the future,
and their fears of a Taliban victory,"" it said.
The Central Intelligence Agency declined to confirm or deny if the document was genuine. But WikiLeaks has
previously posted government and corporate documents that were later verified.
The report by a CIA expert on ""strategic communications"" and State Department analysts of public opinion
warned that popular support for the war in Europe was weak and could easily collapse, citing the recent fall of
the Dutch government over the issue.
""The tone of previous debate suggests that a spike in French or German casualties or in Afghan civilian
casualties could become a tipping point in converting passive opposition into active calls for immediate
withdrawal,"" it said.
The analysis, dated March 11, suggested public relations strategies to drum up support for the war in Germany
and France, which maintain the third and fourth largest troop deployments in Afghanistan.
""Outreach initiatives that create media opportunities for Afghan women to share their stories with French,
German, and other European women could help to overcome pervasive skepticism among women in Western
Europe toward the ISAF (International Security Assistance Force) mission,"" it said.
Public relations efforts could ""tap into acute French concern for civilians and refugees,"" the report said,
suggesting highlighting polls that show most Afghans support the presence of coalition troops.
Such an approach could stress the potential dangers facing Afghan civilians if NATO-led troops were defeated
and ""leverage French (and other European) guilt for abandoning them.""
""The prospect of the Taliban rolling back hard-won progress on girls I- education could provoke French
indignation, become a rallying point for France's largely secular public, and give voters a reason to support a
good and necessary cause despite casualties.""
For German audiences, marketing efforts should underline how Afghans are reportedly optimistic about the
NATO mission and how an international retreat would damage Germany's interests.
""For example, messages that illustrate how a defeat in Afghanistan could heighten Germany's exposure to
terrorism, opium, and refugees might help to make the war more salient to skeptics,"" it said.
The report also suggested taking advantage of President Barack Obama's popularity in France and Germany,
arguing that appeals from the US president on the importance of the allied role in the war could have a positive
effect.
The memorandum is titled: ""Afghanistan: Sustaining West European Support for the NATO-led Mission -- Why
Counting on Apathy Might Not Be Enough.""

We are concerned about the aftermath of Iranian Presidential elections. We fully respect the sovereignty of Iran. At the
same time, we deplore post-electoral violence, which led to the loss of lives of Iranian civilians. We express our solidarity
with those who have suffered repression while peacefully demonstrating and urge Iran to respect fundamental human
rights, including freedom of expression, as ensured by the international treaties it has ratified. The crisis should be
settled soon through democratic dialogue and peaceful means on the basis of the rule of law. We call on the Iranian
government to guarantee that the will of the Iranian people is reflected in the electoral process.

efforts to that effect, such as the readiness of the U.S. to enter into direct talks and the invitation from China, France,
Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States to Iran to restart negotiations, as well as the constructive
involvement of other G8 partners in the process. We stress the need for unity of action on the basis of agreed policy. We
sincerely hope that Iran will seize this opportunity to give diplomacy a chance to find a negotiated solution to the
nuclear issue. At the same time we remain deeply concerned over proliferation risks posed by Iran's nuclear programme.
We recognise that Iran has the right to a civilian nuclear programme, but that comes with the responsibility to restore

New blow for Conservative alliance with UUP
as assembly member quits party
Alan McFarland follows MP Lady Hermon in resigning from Ulster Unionists to sit as independent
• Henry McDonaid, Ireland correspondent
• gi,;ardian.co.uk, Wednesday 31 March 2010 09.48 BST
The ConseNatives' alliance with the Ulster Unionists has sustained a second blow in North Down after last week's
resignation of the sitting MP Lady Hermon.
Assembly member and former army major Alan McFarland announced today that he was leaving the UUP in protest at its
pact with the Tories.
It is expected McFarland will now work for Herman's re-election as an independent against the official UUP-Tory
candidate.
A UUP statement said the timing of McFarland's announcement was ""disappointing"". He has been a UUP member of the
Stormont assembly for 12 years and was once a loyal ally of Lord Trimble, Nprthem Irelard's former first minister.
Trimble has been one of the driving forces behind the UUP-Conservative alliance.
Last night McFarland resigned his membership of the party and said he would now sit as an independent member of the
assembly.
""With the recent confirmation of candidates, including the imposition of a Conservative candidate in my own North Down
constituency,•it is clear that the party is determined to continue down the Conservative road,"" he said in a statement.
""I do not wish to join them. I am sorry to leave a party that contains many good friends, and greatly regret that events have
developed in the way they have.""
Last week Hermon, the MP for North Down, said she would run in the general election as an independent unionist.
In a statement, the Ulster Unionist party thanked McFarland for his service, but said the ""electoral pact has the potential to
transform politics in Northern Ireland in a manner not previously witnessed"" in Ulster.","['Ireland', 'Northern', 'Ireland']"

MEDIA NOTE
Joint Statement on the Upcoming Sudan National Elections
Following is the text of a joint statement by U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Norwegian Foreign Minister Jonas
Store, and United Kingdom Foreign Secretary David Miliband on the upcoming national elections in Sudan.
Begin Text:
National elections in Sudan this month will represent a major milestone in the Comprehensive Peace Agreement that
ended Sudan's twenty-two year civil war, and are an important opportunity for the people of Sudan to participate in the
political process.
We urge all parties in Sudan to work urgently to ensure that elections can proceed peacefully and credibly in April. We
are deeply concerned by reports of continued administrative and logistical challenges, as well as restrictions on political
freedoms. We call on the Government of Sudan, the National Elections Commission, and all political parties to engage in
further dialogue to resolve practical obstacles, procedural impediments, and address allegations of intimidation,
harassment, and safety concerns, and other legitimate concerns raised by various political parties. We continue to urge
the parties to improve conditions on the ground in Darfur and create a secure environment conducive to Darfuri
participation.
Irrespective of the outcome of elections, it is essential that work continues and is accelerated to meet remaining CPA
deadlines. Progress is needed urgently to complete border demarcation, to establish the commissions that will
supervise the referenda for the South and Abyei, to conduct popular consultations in Blue Nile and Southern Kordofan,
and to negotiate sustainable post-CPA arrangements in areas such as wealth-sharing, citizenship and assets, and
liabilities.
We reiterate our commitment to ensure that the referenda must happen on schedule and that their outcomes need to
be respected. It is time to redouble efforts to achieve these ends. We urge all parties in Sudan and all regional and
international partners to work together to achieve the peaceful future that the people of Sudan deserve.","['Sudan', 'U.S.', 'United', 'Kingdom', 'Sudan', 'Sudan', 'Sudan', 'Sudan', 'Sudan', 'Sudan', 'Darfur', 'South', 'Abyei', 'Blue', 'Nile', 'Southern', 'Kordofan', 'Sudan', 'Sudan']"

US foreign policy: aiting on a sun king
By Edward Luce and Daniel Dombey
Published: March 30 2010 22:22 I Last updated: March 30 2010 22:22
For better or for worse, Washington has grown
used to the fact that PgIrack Obama runs the
most centralised — or ""White House-centric"" —
administration since Richard Nixon. When Nixon
wanted foreign policy advice, everyone knew
where he got it from: Henry 'Kissinger, variously
his national security adviser and secretary of
state.
In contrast, Mr Obama has no big foreign policy
strategist. Even insiders give different answers
when asked to whom he turns for advice on the
big international questions. But almost all agree
with the following observation. ""The truth is that
President Obama is his own Henry Kissinger —
no one else plays that role,"" says a senior official.
""Every administration reflects the personality of
the president. This president wants all the trains
Barack Obama at the Great Wall of China last year. Unlike his
predecessor Richard Nixon, who turned to Henry Kissinger for
advice, the US president has no big foreign policy strategist
routed through the Oval Office.""
Fifteen months after he took office, the character and structure of Mr Obama's foreign policy machinery is still evolving.
But from interviews with dozens of insiders and outsiders, including senior officials both authorised and unauthorised to
speak, and three former national security advisers, it is clear the buck not only stops with, but often floats for quite a long
time around, Mr Obama himself.
Foreigners have complained about the tendency of his domestic agenda to crowd out the international one — the passage
last week of healthcare reform was greeted with an audible sigh of relief among US allies. But within foreign policy itself,
his centralised structure can also result in many issues being left on the back burner awaiting presidential attention, say
critics.
""On the positive side, we have a very conscientious president who takes advice widely,"" says the official. ""On the debit
side, for all the president's intelligence, Barack Obama came to office with very little experience. He just doesn't have
much depth on some issues.'
The core of Mr Obama's foreign policy machinery is in the White House-based National Security Council, which advises
the president and co-ordinates activities across an increasingly complex alphabet soup of Washington departments,
military commands and intelligence agencies. The most widely questioned link in the chain is Jim Jones, whom, to many
people's surprise, Mr Obama brought in as his national security adviser.
Only briefly acquainted with Mr Obama beforehand, General Jones, a retired four-star marine corps general, shows little
interest in running the ""inter-agency"" process — a key part of the job. Somewhat unconventionally, Gen Jones travels
frequently and is thus often out of town. Unusually, it is Mr Obama himself who usually chairs the weekly National Security
Council, known as the ""principals meeting"", not Gen Jones.
Rahm Emanuel, Mr Obama's chief of staff, is also a key part of it. ""If you were to ask me who the real national security
adviser is, I would say there were three or four, of whom Rehm is one and of which Gen Jones is probably the least
important,"" says another official.
Anyone who has dealt with Gen Jones speaks highly of his matter-of-factness, his geniality and the respect many foreign
governments have for him — Pakistan and Israel among them. But as he himself admitted rather disarmingly last year, he
does not have a taste for bureaucracy. Speaking at the Atlantic Council, a think-tank where he previously worked, Gen
Jones provoked laughter when he said: ""I fondly remember [the Atlantic Council] as a place where people actually did
what you asked them to do. In my new role I'm finding out that an order is a basis for negotiation.""
The lack of a strong national security adviser has created recurring difficulties. Perhaps the best example is the Arab-
Israeli peace process, which Mr Obama launched on his second day in office when he appointed Geproe Mitphspil as his
envoy. Three months later, Mr Obama insisted Benjamin Netanyahu freeze all settlements activity in order to boost Arab
confidence in the talks.
In a heated ;34.16NA(dpyin the ,Clvg
li..0f7;ce. last May, in which Mr Netanyahu refused to accede to Mr Obama's demand, the
only officials present were Mr Emanuel and David Axelrod, senior adviser to Mr Obama in office and during the campaign.
Gen Jones was not there. The fallout put the talks in abeyance and damped high Arab hopes for Mr Obama.
""The question is, which bright spark advised the president to demand a settlements freeze without working out what the
next step should be when Netanyahu inevitably said 'No'?"" says Leslie Gelb, an official in the Carter administration and
former head of the Council on Foreign Relations. ""Why wasn't George Mitchell in the room? Where was Jones?""
Mr Obama's character is also stamped on the inter-agency process, set up and managed by Tom Donilon, deputy
national security adviser. The nitty-gritty of foreign policy-making is done at these frequent ""deputies' meetings"", which
can sometimes consume four to six hours a day.
Described by one insider as ""the most powerful man in the White House whose name isn't widely known"", Mr Donilon,
who was an official in the Clinton administration, is the man who keeps Mr Obama's trains running on time. And there are
a lot of trains. Last year, Mr Donilon held 270 deputies meetings — a workload described as ""clinically insane"" by a former
senior diplomat under Bill Clinton.
But as time goes on, it is becoming streamlined — now taking up roughly two to three hours a day, say officials. ""People
forget that we inherited two wars, terrorism threats, and perhaps the biggest single eight-year decline [George W. Bush's
two terms] in America's power and reputation in our history,"" says a senior official. ""It took time to put in place a process
that could deal with the very complex decisions we had to take.""
Also the organiser of Mr Obama's 9.30arn national security briefing, Mr Donilon reinstated the paper trails needed to
prevent intra-governmental anarchy, using the model devised by Brent Scowcroft, national security adviser to George
Bush senior and Gerald Ford. Vice-president Joe Biden's team was also incorporated to prevent the kind of ""parallel
process"" Dick Cheney used to circumvent the bureaucracy under George W. Bush.
""If you look for the 2002 or 2003 meeting where the decision to go to war in iraq was taken, you cannot find it,"" says the
senior official. ""By getting the process right, we are improving the quality of decisions.""
The deputies' ties go back years. For example, the families of Mr Don;Ion and Jim Steinberg, deputy secretary of state,
often go on holiday together. Mr Donilon's wife, Cathy Russell, is chief of staff to Jill Biden, the vice-president's wife. Mr
Steinberg's wife, Sherburne Abbott, is deputy to John Holdren, Mr Obama's chief scientific adviser.
All those who regularly attend, including Michele Flournoy, a senior Pentagon official, and Susan Rice, the US
ambassador to the United Nations, have known each other since at least 1993, when they started off in the Clinton
administration. This is just as well, since they spend half their lives together: ""A lot of work gets done in that group,"" says
Ms Flournoy. ""Sometimes it feels like shovelling coal to keep the fires going.""
The refurbished machinery was perhaps most in evidence during the build-up to Mr Obama's decision in December to
send another 30,000 US troops to Afghanistan — a journey that took four months and involved him in 40 hours of Oval
Office meetings.
But the very diligence of the process crowded out Mr Obama's time to focus on other crises — of which there are many.
""Time is the most precious commodity a president has,"" says a former national security adviser. ""On average he is only
going to have 45 minutes a day for foreign policy, so you want to make sure it is well spent.""
The widely expected departure of Gen Jones before the end of the year has also created rivalries within the engine room.
Those who are thought to have ambitions to replace him include Mr Steinberg, Ms Rice, Mr Donilon and Denis
McDonough, NSC chief of staff and the foreign policy official who is personally closest to Mr Obama. Although all are
widely respected, none is considered a big strategic thinker in the Kissinger or Scowcroft mould.
Described by Mr Gelb as Mr Obama's ""Lord High Executioner"", Mr McDonough ""has appended himself to the Chicago
crowd"", says another official. Mr McDonough's widely feared role highlights some of the contradictions of Mr Obama's
foreign policy apparatus.
Once an adviser to former Senate majority leader Tom Deschle, Mr McDonough was frequently at Mr Obama's side
during the campaign. Insiders describe him as the ""enforcer"" and as the keeper of ""message discipline"", a key element of
any campaign but something that can drastically slow the wheels of government.
""McDonough is the guy from the campaign and the one who plays basketball with the president — they're very close,"" says
an official. ""Instead of Jim Jones telling McDonough what the president thinks, it is the other way round.""
Indeed, if Mr Obama's highly centralised foreign policy machine had a face, it would be Mr McDonough's. ""Donilon has
been perceived to make the process inclusive and give everyone a seat at the table,"" says David Rothkopf, a former
Clinton official and scholar on the NSC. ""Fairly or not, McDonough has been perceived as representing a process that
was taking place in another room, among the inner circle, at a table to which most weren't invited.""
Mr Obama has built a machine in which all roads lead to and from him. On the minus side, that means a lot of lower-level
meetings without decisions. It also means neglecting issues that cannot be squeezed into his diary, such as trade policy,
which continues to drift; or relations with India, which are unnecessarily tense.
And it means that the fingerprints of Mr Obama's political inner circle are detected by the rumour mill even when they are
absent, such as on the president's decision to begin the rog,,g: witsirawal from anistan. in July 2011 — a
recommendation that came from Robert Gates, secretary of defence.
On the plus side. Mr Obama has a sharp learning curve, which means his administration continues to evolve. On the plus
side also, if it has to be White House-centric, it is perhaps better with him as the Sun King than, say, Nixon or George W.
Bush.
""At the end of each meeting, the president summarises what everyone has said and the arguments each has made with a
real lawyer's clarity,"" says a participant to the NSC principals meeting, which includes Mr Gates and Mrs Clinton. ""When
the president finally makes a decision, it is with the full facts and usually shows a high calibre of judgment.""
When Mr Obama makes a decision, that is.
STATE AND DEFENCE DEPARTMENTS
An 'alliance of the unsackables' finds it can confront the inner circle
If there is a caveat to the depiction of the Obama administration as White House-centric, it is in the
alliance between Hillary Clinton and Robert Gates, the president's secretaries of state and defence.
Mrs Clinton has proved one of the surprises of Barack Obama's tenure, forging a strong working
relationship with her former rival and establishing herself as his chief foreign policy spokesperson
internationally — if not at home, where Mr Obama's inner circle often seems to monopolise the explaining.
Mr Gates, who recently decided to stay for at least another year, is seen as unsackable, not least for the
credibility he lends on issues ranging from missile defence to Guantanamo Bay and Afghanistan. As a
holdover from the Bush administration, his national security bona fides are hard to dispute. It is no
coincidence that Mrs Clinton is probably the only other unsackable cabinet member.
The combination has made itself felt in some of the administration's most significant debates, notably on
Afghanistan, where both successfully urged the deployment of more troops.
""Gates and Clinton happen to like each other, which no one really predicted,"" says one official, who notes
that while the traditional role of the NSC is to ""play referee"" between the state and defence departments,
it is as often nowadays a combination of the two against the White House. This is very different from how
it worked when Donald Rumsfeld and Colin Powell held those positions.
""We work together well,"" Mr Gates said at an appearance with Mrs Clinton on CNN last year. ""I think it
starts with, frankly, based on my experience, the secretary of defence being willing to acknowledge that
the secretary of state is the principal spokesperson for United States foreign policy.""
Their outlooks often overlap. From the Pentagon, Mr Gates has long called for more US spending on
diplomacy. As chief diplomat, Mrs Clinton has adopted a muscular approach. On Iran, both favour tough
sanctions; on Russia, both have sought to reassure Moscow's neighbours even while improving relations
with the Kremlin.
But for all their workmanlike co-operation, there is no escaping the fact that Mrs Clinton is not part of the
Obama inner circle — a traditionally helpful feature in that job. There is also a constant ""residue of friction""
between Mr Obama's and Mrs Clinton's teams, according to insiders. For example, Cheryl Mills, Mrs
Clinton's chief of staff, has had several run-ins with others in the administration.
One official describes Mrs Clinton as ""totally loyal"" to Mr Obama. He adds: ""She and the president are not
the best of friends — how could they be? But she totally respects the presidency — she was married to a
president and she wanted to be one ... She still might be.""

4942,"After Afghan Shift, Top U.S. Civilians Face Tricky Future By MARK LANDLER WASHINGTON — As General David H.
Petraeus takes command in Afghanistan, the two top American civilian officials in the war face an uncertain and tricky
future, working with a newly empowered military leader, under the gaze of an impatient president who has put them on
notice that his fractious war council needs to pull together.Richard C. Holbrooke, the Obama administration's special
representative to the region, and Karl W. Eikenberry, the ambassador to Afghanistan, both hung on to their jobs in the
uproar that followed Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal's career-ending quotes in Rolling Stone magazine.But privately, at least
one senior White House official suggested using General McChrystal's exit as an excuse for a housecleaning, according to
senior officials. That was rejected as too disruptive during a military campaign that relies heavily on civilian support,
these people said.ln recent days, other administration officials have begun floating the idea that Ambassador Eikenberry
might be replaced by Ryan C. Crocker, the highly regarded former ambassador in Iraq who forged a close partnership
with General Petraeus during the successful Iraq troop increase. Such a prospect is viewed as remote, given Mr.
Crocker's prestigious new post at Texas A&M University. But the fact that his name is being invoked underlines the
challenges that confront Ambassador Eikenberry, as he adapts to a new partner — one who has strong ideas about how
soldiers and diplomats should work together in war. It also illustrates the remarkably powerful role that General
Petraeus will assume in the nine-year-old war, setting him up as almost a viceroy in Afghanistan and a key broker in
negotiations between President Hamid Karzai and Pakistan over an eventual political settlement.Before General
Petraeus's arrival, some critics said the White House had created a problem by recruiting several forceful, ambitious
personalities and giving them jobs with overlapping responsibilities. Administration officials acknowledge that, as one
said, ""there are obviously a number of substantial personalities on the team."" But the White House believes that the
current lineup can mesh, and that a difficult war demands this much talent. Still, the McChrystal blow-up has
reverberated through the State Department. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton instructed Ambassador
Eikenberry and Mr. Holbrooke to take a hard look at the civilian team, two officials said. She is not wedded to the
current lineup if it continues to bog down in internecine battles, they said.""You can't have a major shift in a civ-mil
structure without having the civilian side take a step back and look at everything,"" said a senior State Department
official, using the jargon for a civilian-military campaign.General Petraeus, whose appointment was approved 99-0 by
the Senate on Wednesday, took pains at his confirmation hearing on Tuesday to back a unified civilian and military
effort. He noted then that he had telephoned Mr. Holbrooke and would rendezvous with Ambassador Eikenberry in
Brussels, so the two could land in Kabul together.""Holbrooke has been my wingman, to a great degree,"" General
Petraeus said in an interview. ""We have had, and do have, a very good relationship."" That role, he said, will now fall to
Ambassador Eikenberry.Ambassador Eikenberry was highly critical of the Pentagon's proposal last year to send 60,000
additional troops to Afghanistan, which led to a difficult relationship with General McChrystal. But in fact General
Petraeus was the true architect of the plan.The ambassador, a retired lieutenant general and former commander in
Afghanistan, graduated from West Point in 1973, a year ahead of General Petraeus, but they did not know each other at
the academy. The two share a scholarly bent: General Petraeus holds a Ph.D. from Princeton, while Ambassador
Eikenberry has master's degrees from Harvard and Stanford.While they were never assigned together, their careers
intersected twice. In Iraq, General Eikenberry led an assessment of Iraqi security forces while General Petraeus was
commanding the 101st Airborne Division in Mosul. When General Eikenberry was commander in Afghanistan, General
Petraeus led an assessment of Afghan National Security Forces.General Petraeus declined to discuss personnel issues,
while Ambassador Eikenberry and Mr. Holbrooke turned down requests for an interview. Mr. Crocker, now the dean of
the George Bush School of Government at Texas A&M, did not return a call for comment. For Mr. Holbrooke, the new
landscape is challenging in other ways. Officials said his job security was less in doubt than it was six months ago, when
his ouster was the subject of Washington chatter. Yet he has arguably become a less central player: Jacob J. Lew, a
deputy secretary of state, manages much of the civilian influx in Afghanistan that Mr. Holbrooke helped shape, while the
embassy in Kabul is carrying it out. Mr. Holbrooke's current portfolio has played to his weaknesses, his own allies admit.
He is best as a high-level negotiator, and not as comfortable with the nitty-gritty work of helping Afghanistan build an
economy.These days, Mr. Holbrooke has become a globe-trotting diplomat, trying to retain flagging European allies
while seeking to draw influential Muslim countries like Egypt into helping Afghanistan. At a recent conference of 35
countries in Madrid, Mr. Holbrooke drummed up more support from allies for the Afghan government's campaign to
reintegrate Taliban fighters into mainstream society.Mr. Karzai's longer-term effort to reconcile with Taliban leaders,
and his negotiations with Pakistan, could propel Mr. Holbrooke back into a central role. Were these talks to become
more serious, several officials said, Mr. Holbrooke's negotiating skills could be put to use, as a broker and guardian of
American interests. For now, though, as evidence of General Petraeus's influence, he will do most of the shuttling
between Kabul and Islamabad, the Pakistani capital.On his last visit to the region, Mr. Holbrooke met with Mr. Karzai
and with senior Pakistani officials, including the army chief of staff, Ashfaq Parvez Kayani. Mr. Holbrooke's past run-ins
with Mr. Karzai, several officials said, have not hindered his ability to deal with the Afghan leader, and Pakistani officials
said they trusted him. Husain Haqqani, Pakistan's ambassador to Washington, said that Mr. Holbrooke took time to
understand Pakistan's concerns. ""Ambassador Holbrooke is liked by some, admired by others and seen as effective, even
by those who may not like him,"" Mr. Haqqani said.Still, General Petraeus is indisputably the key player, and he has
wasted no time asserting his control. On a secure videoconference call last Saturday, a person familiar with the call said,
General Petraeus threw his support behind a costly, and controversial, plan to install temporary generators to supply
more electricity to Kandahar, the Taliban stronghold that is the next major American military target.Mr. Holbrooke and
Ambassador Eikenberry swiftly assented.","['Top', 'U.S', 'Afghanistan', 'Afghanistan', 'White', 'House', 'Iraq', 'Iraq', 'Afghanistan', 'Pakistan', 'Brussels', 'Kabul', 'Afghanistan', 'Afghanistan', 'West', 'Point', 'Princeton', 'Iraq', 'Mosul', 'Afghanistan', 'Texas', 'Washington', 'Afghanistan', 'Kabul', 'Afghanistan', 'Egypt', 'Afghanistan', 'Madrid', 'Pakistan', 'Kabul', 'Islamabad', 'Pakistan', 'Washington', 'Pakistan', 'Kandahar']"

4953,"Greetings from Nairobi. I'm at the end of week-long trip to Kampala, Kinshasa and now Nairobi. The trip has been very
productive and I will fill you in on some of the discussions I have been having when I return. In the meantime, I know
that there are a number of discussions with Dan Benjamin and others relating to a new more aggressive approach to
CVE and I wanted to update you on my thoughts in terms of how those critical discussions fit in with our overall
approach to strategic communications around the globe.
As you and I have discussed, it is essential that we become much more pro-active in all our communications efforts. To
put it bluntly, we are in an ""information war"" on all fronts. With the proliferation of media outlets and opportunities
around the world, we must fight aggressively to get, and maintain, our fair share of ""consumer share of mind."" Both our
adversaries and allies recognize the importance of this aspect of foreign policy and are adopting new ways of
communicating with foreign publics. Consumers everywhere are constantly facing a barrage of information and in some
cases misinformation and dis-information. In order to get our messages across and confront the threats posed by our
adversaries, we must develop a new sense of urgency in all our communications efforts. Much has been said and written
about the concept of ""soldier diplomats"". In the same vein, I believe we must empower a corps of ""diplomat soldiers"" to
help us gain ground in this new war.
While countering violent extremism is, and will remain, a key objective of our communications efforts we must apply the
same level of determination with respect to all communications. We must both aggressively promote positive stories
about the US and rapidly respond to attacks against us. In the past, our failure to respond to attacks and distortions has
diminished our credibility and undermined our ability to combat our adversaries. For example, had we not responded to
all the rumors and innuendos surrounding our relief efforts in Haiti, I believe we would have provided a fertile field for
AQ and others to continue to perpetuate the image of the US as an ""invader"".
Before I left for this trip, I convened a meeting of our top PD officers and told them that we must become much more
aggressive in our strategic communications programs and initiatives. We plan to implement daily calls between our new
regional PD DAS's and PAO's in the regions so we can monitor on a daily basis all stories about the USG. We will work
with the Posts to ensure that they have strategies for dealing with stories as they develop. I would also like to request
that you send a cable to all Chiefs of Mission informing of the new strategy and reminding them of their responsibilities
in this critical area. We will work on a draft for your review when you return.
Finally, we are developing new organizational solutions, modeled on an approach I saw at our Mission in Uganda, which
I think will greatly clarify roles and responsibilities with respect to in country communications not only within the
Mission, but across all government agencies within particular countries.
I will continue to update you as we move forward.
Hope your trip is going well. Look forward to greeting together when we are both back in DC.

Hi!!ary Clinton's ""Internet freedom speech iVian
A momentous 40 hours, leading to Clinton/China/Internet
21 Jan 2010 04:12 pm
Apart from two obvious pieces of momentous news in the past day-and-a-half -- the new junior Senator from
Massachusetts, and the new ckv V. V5-
rvi,-
,
,
c.:! (by which I mean today's lamentable, straight-party-line Supreme Court
ruline
;that removes limits from direct corporate underwriting of political campaigns) -- there is one other event today that
will have big ripple effects. i mean SecState Hillary Clinton's speech this morning about ""Internet Freedom,"" mentioned
;:lere and with a prelude discussion
I'm not going to take time for a thorough gloss of the speech. Instead I highly recommend reading the full text, lette, or
watching the official video, .'tere. And for now some of the main points while listening (and noting main points down in real
time with the handy '
uiveaSccibe, pen.)
- In contrast to the dreamy Internet optimism of a decade or so ago -- I'm not naming names, but I remember! -- when
many people imagined that info technology, by itself, would undermine oppression and bring the world together, Clinton
started off with a very astringent reminder that this technology, like others, was neither good or bad in itself and is already
being used in both helpful and destructive ways:
""Amid this unprecedented surge in connectivity, we must also recognize that these technologies are not
an unmitigated blessing. These tools are also being exploited to undermine human progress and political
rights. Just as steel can be used to build hospitals or machine guns, or nuclear power can either energize
a city or destroy it, modern information networks and the technologies they support can be harnessed for
good or for ill. The same networks that help organize movements for freedom also enable al-Qaida to
spew hatred and incite violence against the innocent. And technologies with the potential to open up
access to government and promote transparency can also be hijacked by governments to crush dissent
and deny human rights.""
And a very nice pivot out of this section, effective because it's so blunt and plain:
""On their own, new technologies do not take sides in the struggle for freedom and progress, but the
United States does.""
- Underscoring the ""this is a big deal"" tone of the speech, she enumerated the ""Four Freedoms"" that FDR proclaimed in
1941, as part of the struggle for the world's future, and said there were a comparable set of Four Freedoms for the
Internet age. Check out the speech yourself for details.
- The China surprise: the speech was a more frontal challenge to Chinese internet and overall censorship policy than I
expected, and than I recall in other US-China interactions in a very long time. For instance, early in the speech, an
itemization of the places where suppression is getting worse:
""In the last year, we've seen a spike in threats to the free flow of information. China, Tunisia, and
Uzbekistan have stepped up their censorship of the Internet. In Vietnam, access to popular social
networking sites has suddenly disappeared. And last Friday in Egypt, 30 bloggers and activists were
detained.""
Tunisia, Uzbekistan, Vietnam, Egypt -- this is not the grouping of countries that the Chinese government, in its recent
sense of rise to superpower status, is used to being lumped with. Compared to the US as a financial power, OK;
overtaking japan in economic size, yes; being a crucial player in environmental negotiations.., all that is one thing.
Bracketed in the same sentence with Tunisia and Uzbekistan is different. Sentences like this don't appear in formal, big-
deal SecState addresses by accident.
Other passages to the same effect:
""As I speak to you today, government censors somewhere are working furiously to erase my words from
the records of history. But history itself has already condemned these tactics....
""Those who disrupt the free flow of information in our society or any other pose a threat to our economy,
our government, and our civil society. Countries or individuals that engage in cyber attacks should face
consequences and international condemnation....""
And then the Google section itself.
I had wondered whether the speech would mention Google by name -- and had reason to think it might not. (Main
argument forleavina it implicit rather than referring directly to the Google case: in the company's ongoing efforts to find a
""il
lvineyiftaiv_in"" acceptable way to remain in China, rather than a lose-lose-lose permanent split, its not necessarily a help
to have the U.S. government standing officially by its side. ) But the way Sec. Clinton introduced the point was significant:
as a proxy for China's own ability to H.to,tentiai and sustain its economic rise:
""To use market terminology, a publicly listed company in Tunisia or Vietnam that operates in an
environment of censorship will always trade at a discount relative to an identical firm in a free society. If
corporate decision makers don't have access to global sources of news and information, investors will
have less confidence in their decisions over the long term. Countries that censor news and information
must recognize that from an economic standpoint, there is no distinction between censoring political
speech and commercial speech. If businesses in your nations are denied access to either type of
information, it will inevitably impact on growth.
""Increasingly, U.S. companies are making the issue of internet and information freedom a greater
consideration in their business decisions. I hope that their competitors and foreign governments will pay
close attention to this trend. The most recent situation involving Google has attracted a great deal of
interest. And we look to the Chinese authorities to conduct a thorough review of the cyber intrusions that
led Google to make its announcement. And we also look for that investigation and its results to be
transparent.
""The Internet has already been a source of tremendous progress in China, and it is fabulous. There are
so many people in China now online. But countries that restrict free access to information or violate the
basic rights of internet users risk walling themselves off from the progress of the next century. Now, the
United States and China have different views on this issue, and we intend to address those differences
candidly and consistently in the context of our positive, cooperative, and comprehensive relationship.""
There's a lot more in the speech, including about terrorism, disaster relief, religion, etc -- but it's there for the reading.

Trafficking fears as Haiti children go missing
Posted 5 hours 47 minutes ago
Updated 5 hours 46 minutes ago

The UN has warned countries not to step up adoptions from Haiti in the wake of the disaster. (AFP: Matthew
Marek
United Nations officials say children have gone missing from hospitals in Haiti since the devastating January 12
earthquake, raising fears of trafficking for adoption abroad.
""We have documented around 15 cases of children disappearing from hospitals and not with their own family at
the time,"" said UNICEF adviser Jean Luc Legrand.
""UNICEF has been working in Haiti for many years and we knew the problem with the trade of children in
Haiti that existed already beforehand.
""Unfortunately, many of these trade networks have links with the international adoption market.""
The agency said it had warned countries during the past week not to step up adoptions from Haiti in the
immediate wake of the quake.
However several are fast-tracking adoption procedures already under way, including Belgium, Canada, France,
Germany, the Netherlands, Spain and the United States.
Mr Legrand said the situation was similar to the aftermath of the tsunami in Asia five years ago.
Trafficking networks were springing into action immediately after the disaster and taking advantage of the
weakness of local authorities and relief coordination ""to kidnap children and get them out of the country"".
Rupert Colville, a spokesman for the office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, said child
enslavement and trafficking in Haiti was ""an existing problem and could easily emerge as a serious issue over
the coming weeks and months"".
The UN mission in Haiti has stepped up surveillance of roads, UNICEF officials said.
Mr Legrand said there was separate but only anecdotal evidence of people taking children by road to the
neighbouring Dominican Republic and loading children on to planes.
""We have seen over the past years many children being taken out of the country without any legal procedure,""
he said.
""This is going on. This is happening now. We are starting to have the first evidence of that, this is
unquestionable.""
He was unable to give details on the 15 missing children or their condition or clearly connect the anecdotal
observations in Haiti's chaos with trafficking.
The cases were documented by social workers and by partner non-governmental organisations working for
UNICEF in hospitals.

Should Foreign Corporations Spend Money on U.S. Political Candidates?
Krista Gesaman
Foreign businesses might be the real winners in Citizens United v. Federal Elections Commission, the landmark case that
allows corporations and unions to spend limitless amounts of money on presidential and congressional political
campaigns. A majority of large businesses are now owned by foreign entities, and this means international corporations
could pour tons of money into the United States political scene, potentially swaying the political climate.
The biggest questions with this ruling is the scope of the term ""corporation,"" says Edward Foley, law professor at the Ohio
State University College of Law and director of the election-law program. Does the high court want this decision to apply
to foreign corporations as well as domestic ones, he ponders? The truth is, the court didn't make a decision one way or
the other.
Foley best explains the potential issues by talking about the electronic, video, and communication giant, Sony. The
corporation is headquartered in Japan, but a large number of its shareholders reside in the United States. In fact, people
can even buy and trade Sony's stock on the New York Stock Exchange. The issue is whether this corporation, with strong
ties to a foreign country and the United States, should be permitted to independently contribute money to presidential and
congressional campaigns.
The court sought to expand First Amendment protection for corporations, but did it really mean to promote the free flow of
ideas from Russian or Chinese corporations, Foley asks? Justice John Pau! Stevens focused on the same concerns in his
dissenting opinion. The majority's position ""would appear to afford the same protection to multinational corporations
controlled by foreigners as to individual Americans,"" he writes.
This afternoon, President Obama asked Congress to ""develop a forceful response"" to the ruling. But with Congress
juggling so many other important issues, it's unlikely that a change will be made in the immediate future. This could mean
that foreign cash could be supporting political candidates in next year's congressional midterm elections.","['U.S', 'United', 'States', 'Japan', 'United', 'States', 'United', 'States']"

SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED January 22, 2010
NOTE FOR THE SECRETARY
FROM: G/TIP — Luis CdeBaca
SUBJECT: Child Trafficking in Haiti
G/TIP is gravely concerned about the potential for human trafficking (TIP) in the wake of
the earthquake, both as a result of the displacement of the population and the influx of troops
and aid workers. Even before the earthquake, there were in Haiti up to 300,000 restaveks
(children given away or sold by their parents and enslaved as domestic servants), as well as
reports that members of MINUSTAH used trafficked women in prostitution. In the 2009 TIP
Report Haiti was classified as a Special Case country with governance so dysfunctional it could
not be ranked.
The initial disaster response is focusing on immediate needs of food, shelter, and medical
care, but has thus far not addressed TIP prevention and protection issues. While attention is
being paid to the problems of orphans and adoptees, TIP was not adequately addressed in the
UN's initial flash appeal, so it is unclear which agency in the international system has the lead
on the ground. UNICEF has the child protection lead, UNFPA leads prevention of sexual and
gender-based violence, and IOM is tasked with shelter and camp management. We will work to
remedy, in a subsequent appeal, the omission of TIP from the operational plan.
We are moving to redirect $1 million of program funds that G/TIP has on Hispaniola and to
reprogram an additional $550,000; we will work with PRM to identify other funding
possibilities. Working through existing grantees and other experienced NG0s, it is our
intention to help resuscitate police child protection brigades that already exist in Haiti, to
rebuild capacity of Haitian organizations that protect restaveks, to prevent traffickers in the
Dominican Republic from enslaving displaced Haitians on farms and in prostitution, and to
educate Haitian parents of the risks of giving their children away in this time of crisis. We will
consult with partner agencies to ensure that the U.S. presence does not contribute to
trafficking. It will be important for the Department's messaging to convey our commitment to
fighting human trafficking in both the immediate and long term.

Blogging on the Citizens United Supreme Court ruling is more of what we love about the web. It's the kind of typical
collective dissection we have now come to expect but that never really existed before: serious, speculative, arcane, funny,
brilliant, baked, etc. The Sunliaht Foundation b!000inci is predictably good. Paul Blumenthal dips into the multinational
dimension of the new ""corporation as full citizen-person"" framework, drawing on blogging going on at Neytsweqk and the
CerAer for Pubiic inte'r'.
""Looks like [the Court] might support allowing foreign companies to spend freely in elections in the United States. I guess
this would be the corporate globalization of the U.S. electoral system."" So you gotta ask yourself: Who does Hugo Chavez
want for President?
Blumenthal excerpting the Center for Public Integrity:
The Center for Public Integrity looks at this closer and shows what kind of foreign influence we are
looking at:
One prominent examples is CITGO Petroleum Company — once the American-born
Cities Services Company, but purchased in 1990 by the Venezuelan government-owned
Petroieos de Venezuela S.A. The Citizens United ruling could conceivably allow
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, who has sharply criticized both of the past two U.S.
presidents, to spend government funds to defeat an American political candidate, just by
having CITGO buy TV ads bashing his target.
And it's not just Chavez. The Saudi government owns Houston's Saudi Refining
Company and half of Motive Enterprises. Lenovo, which bought IBM's PC assets in 2004,
is partially owned by the Chinese government's Chinese Academy of Sciences. And
Singapore's APL Limited operates several U.S. port operations. A weakening of the limit
on corporate giving could mean China, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, and any other country
that owns companies that operate in the U.S. could also have significant sway in
American electioneering.
I really can't see Americans being too happy about this.
ha Lithwick reported :rC(' .ate from the Supreme Court as the opinions were being read. She offered this aside:
While Stevens is reading the portion of his concurrence about the ""cautious view of corporate power"" held
by the framers, I see Justice Thomas chuckle softly.
Was it a disdainful chuckle at the impotence of his colleague? Was it merely a chuckle of disagreement, of good-natured
exasperation? Was it a chuckle at an anachronistic vision of the framers set beside today's modern corporate silicon and
steel behemoths? I doubt he was thinking about Hugo Chavez.","['US', 'Neytsweqk', 'United', 'States', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'Houston', 'Singapore', 'U.S.', 'China', 'Saudi', 'Arabia', 'Singapore', 'U.S.']"

5006,"FW: Aceh BackgroundFYI: From one of the folks we hired who had been working with Pierre Louis:
Lessons from the Aceh and Nias Multi-Donor Trust Fund
1. The Government of Indonesia (G01) responded to the Tsunami by issuing a series of government decrees,
and immediately organized both overview and relief efforts to ensure a rational and coordinated
response. The first task was to produce a Damage and Loss Assessment (DLA). The DLA was followed by
a more detailed Master Plan for Rehabilitation and Reconstruction (MPRR). The MPRR provided in-depth
sector plans, spatial planning, the governance and supervision arrangements of finances with
considerable attention to how to avoid or minimize corruption. The process behind the MPRR was
consultative, with a wide range of local stakeholders and public offices being heard. The MPRR was
presented on 26 March, only 3 months after the Tsunami.
2. The MPRR was to form the basis for a general three-stage strategy. The Relief phase was originally set to
six months, but was then reduced to three: January- March 2005. The Rehabilitation phase is to run for
about 21 months, through December 2006, and the Reconstruction phase from July 2006 through
December 2009. The MPRR provides a well defined phasing of interventions.
3. The objectives for the Relief efforts were humanitarian relief: rescue; food and medicine; emergency
infrastructure and temporary shelter; and burying the dead. The Rehabilitation phase is to restore
services to minimum level: public services; economic facilities; banking and financial institutions; trauma
treatments; secure land rights; law and order; and temporary shelter. Finally, Reconstruction is to rebuild
the region: rebuilding the economy (production, trade and banking); the transportation,
telecommunications, and social and cultural systems; improving institutional capacity; and housing.
4. The Government set up a ministerial-level agency to manage the MPRR program from Aceh itself, the
Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Agency for Aceh and Nias. The BRR was formally established end April
2005 and became operational early May. The World Bank Board on 30 March 2005 formally established
the Multi-Donor Trust Fund (MDF) with a Steering Committee comprised of BRR, GOI, donors and civil
society. Having a credible local coordinators was key to success.
5. The EC channels nearly 93% of its funds through the MDF, while only 2.5% of USD 400 million from the
US goes to the MDF. While payments into the fund were slow, disbursements out of it were to begin
with even slower. By October 2005, project agreements for about USD 200 million had been signed, but
only USD 3 million had actually been disbursed. Disbursements picked up the pace thereafter. The delay
was caused by two principal impediments: first, donors were quick to pledge funds, but getting all the
exact written agreements in place took time. This points to the need for donors to be flexible regarding
formal agreements, and accept simple, generic paragraphs that can contribute to speedy resolution of
slightly differing phrasings and concerns. Second, the processing time for project approval and
implementation was a concern. Since the MDF was to have funded projects on-budget, they had to be
implemented by government institutions. This crated bottlenecks.
6. Smaller donors joined because they wished to support the reconstruction efforts in Aceh but do not have
own capacity and often not strong views on how best to pursue this. They want the Bank to assume
fiduciary responsibilities for the funds in a high-risk environment, and also to take a lead in ensuring that
the funds go to prioritized activities. The MDF is thus seen a well-managed bank account with some paid-
for administrative services. However, the all-inclusive Steering Committee made membership large and
to some extent unwieldy, and forced it to discuss both policy and operational issues.
7. The Multi Donor Fund Secretariat has developed an Outreach Strategy that includes regular radio talk
shows, field visits to meet and discuss with beneficiaries and communication through advertisements as
well as a telephone hotline.
8. MDF received praise for engaging the Government of Indonesia (G01) in policy dialogue. The MDF is thus
an entry point for engaging on conditions for sustainability, relevance and impact.
9. Because the MDF does not accept strict ear marking of donor contributions — though it does allow for
preference indications — it means that the funds are freely available for programming according to the
criteria and priorities that the MDF agrees to. Given strong GOI participation, the MDF is seen as the
most successful instrument for harmonization and coordination in an environment that has been
criticized for a lack of coordination. The MDF's Mid Term Review conducted in 2008-2009 found that the
MDF had made a positive contribution to harmonizing donor efforts and to increasing the effectiveness
and efficiency of the reconstruction effort.
10. The MDF did not sufficiently engage the private sector and did not have a coherent job creation strategy.
The MDF lacked executive rights, but GOI and BRR are credited with leveraging a decisive response.","['Aceh', 'Aceh', 'Indonesia', 'Aceh', 'Aceh', 'Nias', 'US', 'Aceh', 'Indonesia']"

This is from Justice Stevens' dissent in the Citizens United case:
If taken seriously, our colleagues' assumption that the identity of a speaker has no relevance to the Government's ability
to regulate political speech would lead to some remarkable conclusions. Such an assumption would have accorded the
propaganda broadcasts to our troops by ""Tokyo Rose"" during World War II the same protection as speech by Allied
commanders. More pertinently, it would appear to afford the same protection to multinational corporations controlled by
foreigners as to individual Americans: To do otherwise, after all, could "" 'enhance the relative voice' ""of some ( i.e. ,
humans) over others ( i.e. , nonhurnans). Ante, at 33 (quoting Buckley, 424 U. S., at 49). aUnder the majority's view, I

other things, a form of speech.

The Settlement Freeze That Never Was, And Never Will Be
On 07.05.10, By Max Blumenthal
0
Linda Forsell's June 21 photos of ongoing construction in the Israeli settlement of Har Homa expose the illusion of
Netanyahu's settlement freeze
With the Israeli settlement moratorium scheduled to expire on September 26, the right-wing parties in Israel's coalition
government are exerting maximum pressure on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to block the policy's renewal. ""Let's
get rid of the freeze and get back to building,"" declared Israeli Minister of Public Affairs and the Diaspora Yuli Edelstein on
Israel National Radio yesterday. ""It's our land anyway!"" (Edelstein lives in the settlement of Neve Daniel).
Back in the US, the former Israel lobbyist and ex-Clinton Assistant Secretary of State Martin Indyk took to the Washington
Post's op-ed page to praise Netanyahu and Barack Obama for ensuring that ""there were zero building starts in the West
Bank settlements.""
During the week of June 21, I traveled through the West Bank with Swedish photojournalist Linda Forsell to document
new settlement construction and the settlers' theft of water from Palestinian towns. Forsell took a series of photos at Har
Homa, a massive Israeli settlement towering over the Palestinian town of Beit Sarhour. Her photos show ongoing
construction of hundreds of new settlement units — documents of the settlement freeze sham.
0
Netanyahu authorized the building of new settlement units just days after he
announced the freeze in November 2009. He attempted to disguise new settlement construction by drawing a false
distinction between the West Bank and ""parts of Jerusalem"" like Har Homa that actually lie outside 1967 lines. As Israeli
government flack Mark Regev remarked in December 2009, ""We've made a clear distinction between the West Bank and
Jerusalem. Jerusalem is our capital and will stay as such."" With a few exceptions, Obama allowed this scheme to go
forward.
According to the Washington Post, Obama's meeting with Netanyahu this week will have more to do with reassuring
Jewish Democrats than with halting the wholesale colonization of the West Bank. As the Post's Anne Kornblut reported,
""The White House meeting will not dwell on some of the most difficult time-sensitive issues, including the expiration of a
moratorium on Israeli settlement construction in September."" This may mean an end to the settlement freeze, but it was
only an illusion after all.","['Israel', 'US', 'Israel', 'West', 'Bank', 'West', 'Bank', 'Beit', 'Sarhour', 'West', 'Bank', 'Jerusalem', 'West', 'Bank', 'Jerusalem', 'Jerusalem', 'West', 'Bank']"

Jake mentioned that you asked for more information about a proposal made in 2005 for a global CT organization, and he
asked me to find out a little about it. Below is some brief information on the proposal, which was made by Saudi Arabia:
The proposal made by the then crown prince (now king) in Feb. 2005 called for the establishment of an international
counterterrorism center ""under the auspices of the UN."" The purpose of the organization would be to, among other
things, ""develop a mechanism for exchanging information and expertise between States"" on a wide range of non-
military counterterrorism issues, encourage the establishment of national and regional centers, and provide assistance
to developing countries to deal with crises and terrorist acts. The center, as conceived in 2005, would also allow national
counterterrorism coordinators from different countries and regions to meet and share information and experiences.
This proposal was endorsed by the OIC (and OIC countries reaffirm their support for the center each year at the UNGA),
but has never received any serious consideration within the UN by non-OIC members. The Saudis continue to be
interested in implementing the proposal. Most significantly, recently there have been discussions between the UN and
Saudis as to how their proposal could be married with efforts to enhance the UN's capacity to support implementation
of the UN Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy by allowing the UN Counter-Terrorism Task Force (CTITF) Office and the
different CTITF member entities to engage more actively and directly with CT experts/practitioners in capitals and have
multilateral CT consultations wherever necessary.
But S/CT mentioned that, if we were to move forward
on S/CT's CFO idea, we would hope to work closely with the Saudis.

by Leslie H. Gelb
July 7, 2010 I 2:38pm
I ri==IPresident Barack Obama meets with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the Oval
Office of the White House, July 6, 2010. (Gary Fabiano / Sipa Press) Obama's bow to Netanyahu was
just the latest in a series of disastrous missteps in U.S. policy toward Israel. Leslie H. Gelb on who's to
blame—and how the White House can get back on course.
Whoever advised President Obama to flay Israel publicly until this week should be fired. Only advisers with no experience
in dealing with Israel could have believed that Israeli leaders like Prime Minister Netanyahu would bow to public attacks.
And whoever advised Mr. Obama to kneel rhetorically to Mr. Netanyahu in public on Tuesday should also be fired. The
only thing accomplished by this embarrassing tactic was to put Israel in a position to call the shots on Mideast policy for
the rest of Obama's first term.
The real enemy of a negotiated settlement in the Mideast is not time; it's failure.
Were the culprits the non-foreign policy White House intimates — chief of staff Rahm Emanuel and political honcho David
Axelrod? Axelrod knows nothing about this, and worse, Emanuel thinks he does because he lived in Israel. Was George
Mitchell, the president's Mideast negotiator, the brains behind the foolishness? Surely, he's had enough experience
working with Israelis to know better. Did General James Jones, the National Security Adviser, remain silent, again? And of
course, where was Secretary of State Hillary Clinton? Strangely for someone so adept at pleasing Israel's constituents in
America, she spent a lot of time this past year publicly beating up on Israeli leaders. Has she been led astray by the pro-
Arab contingent of the State Department?
•Martin Indyk: New Hope for Mideast Peace
•Peter Beinart: Netanyahu's Latest Insult Or is the guilty party none other than President Obama himself? The more we
find out about who makes decisions in the White House on every subject from nuclear weapons to coloring of Easter
eggs, it turns out to be the man in the Oval Office himself. He's the expert. He's the decider. He invites everyone to state
his or her piece or peace, then he tells them what to do — and seemingly without question, they do his bidding.
Mr. Obama started his White House tenure from a near-zero base of foreign policy knowledge and no experience in the
Middle East. It was easy enough to guess this blissful state from his earliest decisions. He came out of the box demanding
that Israel agree to suspend construction on the West Bank as a precondition for direct negotiations with the Palestinians.
Anyone who knew anything about this situation surely would have told the president that the chances of Mr. Netanyahu
agreeing to this ""proposal"" were zero, or minus zero. No Israeli leader, even a dovish one, would ever dream of beginning
negotiations by conceding his major bargaining card. As the teenagers say, what were Obama and his advisers thinking?
And yes, after the Israelis publicly humiliated Vice President Biden during his trip to the Holy Land by announcing they
would start new construction in East Jerusalem, Washington had to respond vehemently. The Israelis had been arrogant
and stupid on this one. They had weakened American power in the region. No U.S. president could let them get away with
it. Clinton and others made strong public statements of criticism, and those were fine. But Mr. Obama then allowed Mr.
Netanyahu to come ahead with his planned visit to D.C. — and publicly humiliated him. The U.S. president let the Israeli
prime minister cool his heels for hours before meeting with him, then wouldn't shake his hand when he departed. There's
no surer way to unite a nation behind its leader, even a controversial one like Netanyahu, than to have a foreign leader
humiliate him.
This brilliant tactic — thought of by Obama's advisers or the president himself — accomplished two things. It stiffened Israeli
backs even further against being conciliatory about starting talks with the Palestinians. The Israeli government was not
about to cave to American pressures. It also galvanized Israeli supporters in the United States — in particular within
conservative parts of the Jewish community and the Republican Party. There went Mr. Obama's support for pressing
Israel even in private.
To top this all off with Tuesday's meeting, full of smiles and the adoption of Israeli-desired language on almost every topic,
only made matters worse. It made the situation look as if the American president had been cowed by Jewish control of
. .
American politics. That certainly pleased American and Israeli hawks, but it did not please others who want to see
genuine progress in Mideast talks.
There is a time and place for Washington to put pressure on Israel. Mr. Obama and his team picked every wrong time and
place. The right occasion to squeeze is when the negotiations have reached the point where both sides have given and
where both must give more to close the deal. Only at that point does pressure make sense. All parties would get a real
shot at peace in return for their concessions.
To be sure, many ask at this point — How do you get to that point? The answer is not to browbeat the parties to scurry to
the negotiating table. That tactic simply never pays off. The answer is to build conditions beyond the negotiating table,
conditions in the political community in both Israel and Palestine, that would support compromises at the table. The British'
pushed the Catholics and Protestants to make concessions year after year, only to fail time and again, only to further
inflame feelings all around and spur greater violence. Finally, London focused on getting Protestant and Catholic women
to form common groups to support compromise. London did as much with various business communities that evolved into
backers of mutual concessions as well. Only then did parties know that they had support for compromises, their
negotiations got somewhere, and they reached agreement. That's what needs to be done between Israel and the
Palestinians.
We hear time and again that the enemy of peace in the Middle East is time, and that time is running out. Perhaps that is
what has caused Mr. Obama and his team to misstep so badly; they think it's a race against the clock. Do something now
or fail. But the real enemy of a negotiated settlement in the Mideast is not time; it's failure. Neither Israel nor the
Palestinians nor the United States can afford to fail again. After yet another failure, it could well result in perpetual
violence.
To set his Arab-Israeli policy on a sensible course, Mr. Obama needs to search for new advisors who know how to get
things done in the Middle East, hire them, and listen to them.

H: fyi, leaked Luntz poll on Bibi policies; and many congrats to Huma! Sid
Below is a transcript from Israeli TV News Channel Ten on a leaked poll taken last week by Frank Luntz. Here's a
summary:
1. 56% of Americans agree with the claim that there is a humanitarian crisis in Gaza;
2. 43% of Americans agree with the claim that people in Gaza are starving;
3. 34% of Americans support the Israeli operation against the Flotilla;
4. 20% of Americans ""felt support"" for Israel following announcement of easing of Gaza closure.
Frank Luntz analyses Netanyahu's media performance in the flotilla affair
The figures are troubling and worrisome. If that is the situation with our great friend the US, it is easy to imagine the
situation in other, somewhat less sympathetic countries.
Channel Ten TV News, July 1 2010 20:38
Yaacov Eilon (host): Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is considered to make an extremely persuasive presentation in
the world press. But a professional analysis by a US expert presented yesterday to his senior aides strongly criticizes him.
Netanyahu's messages on the flotilla caused more harm than good. Our political correspondent Chico Menashe has
obtained the report.
Chico Menashe: Criticism of Prime Minister Netanyahu's current PR messages and Israeli PR in general comes from the
international elite of media consultants and pollsters and from the mouth of Frank Luntz, considered one of the leading
American political consultants, a Republican pollster, a consultant to many governments throughout the world and to
dozens of the biggest corporations in the US. He was asked by the Jewish organization The Israel Project to check the
opinions of the American public on the messages Israel issued to the world during and after the flotilla events. The result
is a harsh document that primarily criticizes the media strategy of the person considered Israel's number one
propagandist in the world, Prime Minister Netanyahu.
Netanyahu: Once again Israel faces hypocrisy and a biased rush to judgment.
Chico Menashe: Every time Israeli speakers begin with accusing the international community, writes Luntz, they
lose their audience. For example, Netanyahu's comments after the flotilla about the world hypocrisy were rejected by
most of the American participants who listened to them. The findings were presented last night to senior members of
Netanyahu's Bureau. Luntz checked the opinions with focus groups, not a poll. He warns of a dangerous slide in the
public opinion of the only country considered pro-Israeli, the U.S. Israel misses simple opportunities to change world
public opinion, he writes, and the consequences are significant. The American public increasingly hesitates to accept
arguments that support Israeli positions.
Ehud Barak: There is no hunger in Gaza and no humanitarian crisis.
Netanyahu: There's no shortage of food, there's no shortage of medicine, there's no shortage of other goods.
Chico Menashe: Luntz says Israel must immediately stop using the argument that there is no hunger and no
humanitarian crisis in Gaza. He says this fatally destroys Israel's credibility in light of the images on the
television screens. Israel must admit that there is a problem, he says, to gain the listeners' sympathy [emphasis
mine]. Luntz finds the troubling figure that 56% of participants agree with the claim that there is a humanitarian crisis in
Gaza, and no less astonishing is that 43% of participants from the American public agree with the claim that people in
Gaza are starving. But even lifting the closure that was supposed to improve Israel's image missed the opportunity,

Netanyahu: Yesterday an important decision was made by the security cabinet. Its meaning is clear. On the one hand,
allowing civilian goods into Gaza, and on the other hand maintaining the military blockade of Hamas.
Chico Menashe: The statement by Netanyahu's bureau of lifting the closure missed the opportunity to gain
support in international public opinion [emphasis mine]. Only 20% of the Americans polled felt support of Israel
following the statement. According to Lunt, this is the summary of the flotilla damage in American public opinion: Only
34% of the American public support the Israeli operation against the flotilla, and he says that is a dangerously low
percentage.","['Gaza', 'Gaza', 'Israel', 'Gaza', 'US', 'US', 'US', 'Israel', 'Israel', 'Israel', 'Israel', 'U.S.', 'Israel', 'Gaza', 'Israel', 'Gaza', 'Israel', 'Israel', 'Gaza', 'Gaza', 'Israel', 'Gaza', 'Israel']"

Americans Disapproving Obama Poised to Enable
Republican Gains

Chart: Poll Results
Attachment: Poll results and methodology
Americans disapprove of U.S. President Barack Obama's handling of almost every major issue and are
deeply pessimistic about the nation's direction, offering a bullish environment for Republicans in the
November congressional elections.
A majority or plurality disapproves of Obama's management of the economy, health care, the budget
deficit, the overhaul of financial market regulations and the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, according to a
Bloomberg National Poll conducted July 9- 12. In addition, almost 6 in 10 respondents say the war in
Afghanistan is a lost cause.
Almost two-thirds say they feel the nation is headed in the wrong direction, an even more sour
assessment than in March when 58 percent felt that way. Two-thirds of independent voters are
pessimistic, while just 56 percent of Democrats offer a vote of confidence.
""They don't see any solutions in sight,"" said J. Ann Selzer, president of Selzer & Co., a Des Moines, Iowa-
based firm that conducted the nationwide survey. ""They have been hammered by the economy and there
is a disconnect between the lives Americans are living and Washington. They seem to have lost hope.""
Poll respondents are divided on their congressional preference between Democrats and Republicans,
with both sides getting 43 percent support. Among those who say they are most likely to vote,
Republicans are favored, 48 percent to 40 percent. The Republican advantage is even greater among
likely voters who view the election as exceptionally important, with Republicans beating Democrats 56
percent to 34 percent.
Control of Congress
For the Democrats, whd control Congress and the White House, the survey shows the potential 'for losses
in November, when voters will fill all 435 House seats, 36 Senate seats and 37 governorships. The
outcome could affect °Pam's ability to move his agenda through Congress for the two years leading up
to his own 2012 re-election bid.
The fate of incumbents will depend to some extent on what happens to the economy in the next four
months and whether unemployment drops much from its current 9.5 percent. A rising stock market could
help as well. So far this year, the S&P 500 stock index has declined 1.8 percent.
The public's disenchantment with the president's Policies doesn't extend to voter feelings about Obama
himself, as he gets a job approval rating of 52 percent and personally is viewed favorably by 55 percent.
Obama, 48, remains more popular than any of the Republican figures tested in the poll and is topped only
by Secretary of State :-- ;:!aity ant.cn and General Da,,,td Petraeos, the new commander of U.S. forces in
Afghanistan, among a list of 15 people and political parties reviewed.
Republican Leaders
The only bright spot for Republican candidates is for Louisiana Governor Eiob%) 1i:tele!, who gets a 32
percent favorable rating and an 18 percent unfavorable grade. Better-known party leaders such as former
vice presidential candidate :a-et..n and former House Speaker Netf,ri: CirigPait both have negative
ratings that outweigh the positive views.
Although turnout in midterm elections is historically lower than in presidential races, the electorate is
interested. Four- fifths of Americans who plan to vote say November's election is very or exceptionally
important.
The likelihood to vote is strongest among older voters, Republicans and those with the highest incomes.
Among those 55 and older. three-quarters say they will definitely vote, compared with 48 percent of those
younger than 35. Four-fifths of Republicans say they will definitely vote, compared with 65 percent of
Democrats and 62 percent of independents.
Referendum on °barna
Seeking to capitalize on the intensity expressed by voters, Republicans want to make the election a
national referendum on Obama and the party in power, while the White House and Democrats argue it is
about going forward, rather than backward to failed policies.
The challenge for Democrats will be to translate their vision of a better future into more positive feelings
about the economy among voters. In the poll, Republicans have the advantage among the independents
often critical to winning elections. Among independents likely to vote, Republican congressional
candidates are preferred to Democrats, 50 percent to 29 percent.
""Anything that has been tried hasn't resulted in making anything better in the world where ordinary people
live,"" Selzer said. ""That's a bad scenario for incumbents of the majority party.""
Incumbent Disadvantage
A third of poll participants say they would be less likely to vote for a candidate who has served in
Congress for many years. About one-fifth of likely voters say the election is more about sending a
message, while three-quarters say it is about picking the party that has the best ideas.
""I don't know what these people are thinking in Washington,"" says poll respondent Jeff Lockman, 41, a
professional golfer and Republican from Malvern, Pennsylvania. ""They are going in 10 different directions
and they really don't know what to focus on.""
The proportion who feel the nation is headed in the wrong direction is about the same as at this poin't in
1994, when Republicans took control of Congress, and 2006, when Democrats took over.
The public also has soured on Obama's foreign-policy priority, the war in Afghanistan. While the president
has ordered an expansion of forces to turn the tide in a conflict where he says the U.S. has a critical stake,
58 percent say it is a lost cause, compared with 36 percent who say it can still be won. A slim majority of
Republicans -- 52 percent -- say the U.S. can still win in Afghanistan, while 71 percent of Democrats say
the conflict is lost.
Afghanistan Withdrawal
Six in 10 Americans say it would be best to stick with Obarna's plan to start withdrawing forces in July
2011, while one-third say they remain open to keeping the same number of troops there, or even adding
additional forces.
Reflecting the belief among many that the war cannot be won, a third of Americans say they have become
less supportive of the effort there in recent months.
The Bloomberg National Poll is based on interviews with 1,004 U.S. adults ages 18 or older. Percentages
based on the full sample may have a maximum margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.
:4:?,r;yr• '.
3cwrra:1, who studies public opinion at the ,A;-necicar Entarpr:F.:e institute, a public-policy research
group in Washington, cails the poll ""very, very grim news for the Democrats.""
At the same time, she says, one silver lining for Democrats is that Republicans have yet to convince
voters that they have a plan.
Obarna Visit
One signpost for Democrats in the poll is the finding that just 26 percent of Americans say it would help a
Democratic candidate in their area to get a visit from Obama, while 20 percent say it would hurt the
candidate and 54 percent say it wouldn't matter or they don't know.
Obama's worst ratings are for his handling of the budget deficit, where 59 percent disapprove and 37
percent approve. It's his worst grade for that subject in any of four Bloomberg polls taken since
September 2009. The Obama administration expects a record budget deficit this year of more than $1.5
trillion, or 10.6 percent of GDP, according to projections the White House released in February. It was
$1.4 trillion for the 2008-2009 fiscal year, which covers the end ofGecrge W. Bush's presidency, and
Obama has said that the current fiscal shortfall as well as theunemployment rate are inheritances from his
Republican predecessor's administration.
""My biggest fear is we have people in government who don't have a clue about what is going on in the
economy,"" says poll respondent Jim Heeter, 66, from Glendale, Arizona. ""They have never run a business
or had to make a payroll.""
Economy, Health Care
Slim majorities disapprove of Obama's handling of the economy and health care. When it comes to
creating jobs, he gets 46 percent approval, addressing problems on Wall Street, 42 percent support,
running the war in Afghanistan, 46 percent approve, and managing the BP Plc oil spill, 46 percent
support.
Forty-five percent say they have become more supportive in recent months of tougher regulations for Wall
Street. The momentum is heading in the opposite direction from the White House and Democrats on most
other issues.
Almost half say they have become less supportive in recent months of federal money being loaned to
automotive companies to help them stay in business, while 37 percent have become less supportive of
the health-care overhaul passed by Congress earlier this year. A majority, 61 percent, say the nation
should wait and see how the health-care legislation works or leave it alone, while 37 percent want to see it
repealed.
Arizona Immigration Law
Almost half of Americans say they have also grown more supportive of allowing local law enforcement to
detain anyone who can't produce proof of citizenship when stopped for an offense, as is contemplated in
an Arizona law. Cbama has criticized the measure and the Justice Department has announced it plans to
sue Arizona.
At least half of respondents also say they would be less likely to support candidates who voted to give
financial assistance to the banking or automobile industries.
Americans are roughly divided on whether they would be more or less likely to support a candidate who
voted against extending unemployment benefits because of concern over the cost. A measure providing
such support worth $34 billion is stalled in Congress.
Clinton Popularity
The disaffection with Obarna and Democrats doesn't carry over to all Democrats. Hillary Clinton, 62, is
viewed favorably by 61 percent of respondents and a quarter of Americans, including 30 percent of
Republicans and 21 percent of Democrats, say the nation would be in a better place if she had been
elected president.
The Tea Party movement, which has been mainly associated with Republicans, has lukewarm support in
the poll. A majority of 58 percent of all respondents says it would make no difference to them if a
candidate was backed by Tea Party activists, while a third of Republicans say that kind of backing would
make a candidate more appealing to them.
Those who are more likely to think the Tea Party is a simplistic and misguided movement -- 44 percent of
all respondents -- include Democrats, 65 percent, and those with the highest incomes, 52 percent.
Independent voters are divided on whether it is misguided or has rightly identified that the nation would be
better served by reduced federal government, compared with 39 percent overall.","['U.S.', 'Gulf', 'of', 'Mexico', 'Afghanistan', 'Des', 'Moines', 'Washington', 'U.S.', 'Afghanistan', 'Louisiana', 'Washington', 'Malvern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Afghanistan', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'Afghanistan', 'U.S.', 'Washington', 'Glendale', 'Arizona', 'Wall', 'Street', 'Afghanistan', 'White', 'House', 'Arizona', 'Arizona']"

The Security Council deeply regrets the loss of life and injuries resulting from the use of force during the Israeli military
operation in international waters against the convoy sailing to Gaza. The Council, in this context, condemns those acts
which resulted in the loss of at least ten civilians and many wounded, and expresses its condolences to their
families. The Security Council requests the immediate release of the ships as well as the civilians held by Israel. The
Council urges Israel to permit full consular access, to allow the countries concerned to retrieve their deceased and
wounded immediately, and to ensure the delivery of humanitarian assistance from the convoy to its destination. The
Security Council takes note of the statement of the UN Secretary—General on the need to have a full investigation into
the matter and it calls for a prompt, impartial, credible and transparent investigation conforming to international
standards. The Security Council stresses that the situation in Gaza is not sustainable. The Council re-emphasizes the
importance of the full implementation of Resolutions 1850 and 1860. In that context, it reiterates its grave concern at
the humanitarian situation in Gaza and stresses the need for sustained and regular flow of goods and people to Gaza as
well as unimpeded provision and distribution of humanitarian assistance throughout Gaza. The Security Council
underscores that the only viable solution to Israeli-Palestinian conflict is an agreement negotiated between the parties
and re-emphasizes that only a two-State solution, with an independent and viable Palestinian State living side by side in
peace and security with Israel and its other neighbours, could bring peace to the region. The Security Council expresses
support for the proximity talks and voices concern that this incident took place while the proximity talks are underway
and urges the parties to act with restraint, avoiding any unilateral and provocative actions, and all international partners
to promote an atmosphere of cooperation between the parties and throughout the region.","['Gaza', 'Israel', 'Israel', 'Gaza', 'Gaza', 'Gaza', 'Gaza', 'Israel']"

In advance of your meeting tomorrow with George Soros, below is some information in response to the letter you
received from Soros proposing increased USG support for the American University of Central Asia (AUCA). SCA favors
providing more USG support for AUCA
Since 9/11 the United States has provided more than $15 million to AUCA in support of its endowment and various
other initiatives. For a majority of these contributions the Soros Foundation matched one dollar for every two dollars
provided by the USG. The major USG contributions to AUCA were two grants to the university endowment, the first in
2003 for $10 million, the second in 2008 for $3 million. Other USG support for AUCA included funding for two advisors to
the AUCA president on accreditation and development, support for the journalism faculty, and scholarship funds for
students from Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Afghanistan to attend the university.
Soros has proposed that the USG increase this support, offering a 1-1 match of $10 million each from State and his
foundation, totaling $20 million over the next five years. Last fall SCA received the same proposal from Soros, and they
have been discussing the issue with Soros' staff.
A little bit of additional information from SCA on AUCA: The university has made significant progress this year on a
number of its key objectives and remains a unique institution in Central Asia, a place where students are judged solely
on merit and a forum for free expression and critical thinking. The university achieved an important milestone this year
related to its U.S. accreditation, signing an agreement with Bard College under which AUCA graduates starting next May
will receive full diplomas from Bard College, an institution accredited in the United States. In addition, AUCA recently
established a new partnership with the American University in Kabul facilitated through state of the art video classroom
technology and recently announced the appointment of Andrew Wachtel, from Northwestern University, as the new
AUCA president who will take office this summer.
I will include this note (in addition to Soros' letter) in your materials for your meeting with Soros tomorrow. Please let
me know if you would like any further information.

•
•
c) Jeremy Greenstock
o quardian.co.uk, Wednesday 2 June 2010 12.29 BST
So it has happened again. Nearly 18 months after the Israelis bombed Gaza to a wasteland, with barely a load of building
materials allowed in since then, Turkey has taken the brunt of an operation of humanitarian assistance gone wrong.
The UN must establish the facts impartially and independently and, if laws have been broken, those responsible must be
held to account. Political demonstrations posing as relief flotillas go wrong too easily and Israel understandably has to
prevent weapons being smuggled into Gaza. But was this really the best way to bring the ships to shore for examination?
A commando attack on civilian ships looks callous and disproportionate. No one should have been hurt, whatever the
emotions behind all this.
Why is Gaza under siege in the first place? Under international law, the Israelis are responsible as the occupying force for
the proper administration of the territory; and half the point of Israel is not to be above the law. Yet they are creating a
traumatised territory of 1.5m neighbours, many of whose children seem to want to grow up to be suicide bombers. They
are also pouring fertiliser on al-Qaida's ground.
The director of UNRWA operations in Gaza, John Ging, gave a speech in London this week entitled ""Illegal, inhuman. and
insane: a medieval siege on Gaza in 2010"". This objective humanitarian practitioner should be listened to. How has Israel,
the only democracy in its region and a symbol of the need for racially inspired violence to end, come to risk any claim to
international legitimacy in its handling of this situation?
Hamas are the enemy of Israel, but they do not have to be. They preach violent resistance too readily, yet over the past
17 months they have been trying to control the militant groups intent on threatening Israel with rockets — imperfectly
perhaps, but not a single Israeli citizen has been killed (alas, one immigrant worker was) by a rocket since the Gaza
bombing stopped in January 2009. They are also the implacable opponents of al-Qaida. They won a fair election in 2006
and claim to respect democracy. Let's test them on that. At present, Hamas security people are being sniped at by the
Israeli Defence Forces when they try to arrest other militant groups. This is genuinely getting insane.
The unwisdom of reliance on angry military responses is all the clearer when the mood in Palestine, in both the West
Bank and Gaza, is steadily moving towards a negotiated end to the occupation. I am convinced from my own direct
experience that Hamas is prepared to establish and respect a long-term ceasefire so that the talking can start without the
threat of violence, and that they would enter in good faith, if that were reciprocated, into negotiations to establish two
states in the disputed territories, Israel and Palestine, with their own rights and responsibilities under international law.
The distortion of their position, a little of it the fault of their own PR, does no side any good.
If a comprehensive negotiation is too much to expect for now, what about a first step? I believe an arrangement to end the
blockade is within reach if only Israel, Egypt and Gaza would test the possibilities of dialogue. Hamas have indicated that
they could cease all attacks on Israeli soil, close the tunnels, release Gilead Shalit and stop the import of arms into Gaza if
the blockade was ended, an agreed number of Palestinian prisoners were released and Gaza began to be rebuilt.
The Palestinians of course have work to do on their own internal reconciliation, while the relationship between Fatah in
the West Bank and Hamas in Gaza remains so bad. But the UN, the US, Russia, the EU and the Arab world must make a
much more serious attempt to test the possibilities, putting ordinary Israelis and Palestinians first, not their own political
comfort.
We are coming close to losing the chance of a two-state solution. US policy, based on a West-Bank-only approach, is
locked in a cul-de-sac if Gaza is left out of the equation, because majority Palestinian support will be lacking. Israel is
confident in the knowledge that it cannot be militarily defeated.
But that ignores the huge danger of losing the political, diplomatic, legal and moral high ground. This matters in today's
world, as the US and the UK discovered in Iraq, because government authority and public opinion interact closely, and
legitimacy breeds support.
Israel's relationship with Turkey was the key to a broader understanding with the Islamic community and others beyond
the west. That now lies in tatters. If Israel is left as the permanent occupier, or controlling a one-state structure with part of
its population downgraded or imprisoned, it will truly be a disaster for its people and what they stand for.
I hope that Hamas will not sit back and enjoy Israel's discomfiture. They have so far, for a political organisation, attracted
much too narrow a range of international support. If they wish to be widely accepted as a negotiating partner, they must
unequivocally accept the only fully justified condition set by the international Quartet — the cessation of violence —
underline that their objective is a two-state settlement, and win international friends for the ending of the occupation. In
whoever's hands, bombs, bullets, rockets and iron bars will achieve nothing. But a push for justice will.

USIBC Launches New Education Initiative to Strengthen K-12, Vocational, and Higher Education Linkages in the U.S. and
India
June 2, 2010 - Washington, DC - On the occasion of its 35th anniversary, and looking ahead to the global economy of
the future, the U.S.-India Business Council (USIBC) today announced the launch of a new initiative aimed at
strengthening institutional linkages between academia, industry and NGOs focusing on the elementary, vocational and
higher education sectors in both countries.
""The United States and India must be committed partners in building the workforce of tomorrow, a partnership that will
unleash opportunity, spur growth and sustain prosperity not just in our countries but across the global community,"" said
Harold McGraw III, incoming USIBC Chairman and Chairman, President and CEO of The McGraw-Hill Companies. ""To do
this, we must focus on strengthening our educational ties at every level. By working together our two countries can
equip the next generation with the education and skills necessary to compete and win in the global economy.""
Mr. McGraw gave the keynote address before a packed audience of over 400 U.S. and Indian business, government, and
education leaders at USIBC's 35th Anniversary Summit, entitled ""A Pivotal Period in U.S.-India Relations: Tackling
Education, Infrastructure and Inclusive Growth.""
On the eve of the first-ever U.S.-India Strategic Dialogue, India's Union Minister of External Affairs, SM Krishna, U.S.
Education Secretary Arne Duncan, India's Minister of Human Resource Development, Kapil Sibal, and India's Ambassador
to the United States, Meera Shankar, joined hundreds of top business leaders in Washington to participate in the U.S.-
India Business Council 35th anniversary deliberations.
USIBC's Education Initiative will serve as a dynamic platform for business, NGOs, and academia to provide vital input into
both the U.S. and Indian governments - such that the synergies between American and Indian business and educational
communities are unleashed.
""We can talk about strategic, defense, civil nuclear, renewable energy and every other type of commercial cooperation,
but if we do not develop the skill sets in our respective societies to sustain such collaboration, all this talk will never be
successfully converted to action,"" Ron Somers, President of the U.S.-India Business Council, noted. ""How fortunate it is
that families across all walks of life in both our societies so highly value education. We have much to learn from one
another, and much to accomplish - to prepare for the challenges of the 21st Century,"" Somers said.
The USIBC Education initiative will focus on three thrust areas:
1. Higher Education: USIBC will host the U.S.-India Higher Education Forum (HEF) at the invitation of the U.S. and
Indian governments. The HEF will serve as the premier platform to enlist academia, industry and NGOs to strengthen
linkages between U.S. and Indian educational institutions from both countries. The HEF will provide a formalized
network for industry, academia and the NGO community to provide direct policy input to the U.S. and Indian
governments in all areas of education, with an aim to facilitate greater collaboration, including the opening of India's
higher education sector.
2. Elementary K-12 Education : USIBC has embarked on a survey of rural and urban, private and public K-12 schools
throughout India to identify best practices that are working well in educating students, while assessing needs where
industry, NGOs and government may join together to fill gaps. With the support of Ryan International Group, one of
India's leading educators, both financial and intellectual resources will be mobilized to transform these and other
schools in a manner that promotes replication of successful models across India.

Studies of Vocational Training and Skills Development that are being implemented across India. The exercise will
attempt to enlist more corporations to participate in this important area of human capacity building. Programs helping
to train thousands of workers will generate employment opportunities and sustain economic growth now and for the
long future - in both countries.
India is embarked on expanding its community college system, including technical training institutions, as well as inviting
interest in implementing 30,000 new colleges and 1,500 universities over the next decade.
The United States continues to be the most sought after destination for Indian students studying overseas, attracting as
many as 113,000 each year to American universities and colleges. The U.S. wishes to remain a magnet for attracting the
best and the brightest from around the world by promoting institutional partnerships between U.S. based educational
institutions and new counterparts. Integral to this core knowledge infrastructure, industry must be involved in this
enterprise.

Boys home closing, but numbers don't tell full story
By Burt Constable I Daily Herald Columnist
Published: 6/3/2010 12:01 AM
When the goal is turning around lives of young abused and neglected boys, filling out the scoresheet
is more complicated than simply marking wins or losses.
For the past 15 years, Ann G. Deuel has lived in Arlington Heights, but her heart has resided in Jamal
Place, a three-story graystone at 1335 S. California Ave. in the North Lawndale neighborhood of
Chicago. As a founder and executive director of Jamal Place, Deuel can tell countless stories about
the boys, ages 11 to 17, who have spent time in the group home and about the army of suburbanites
from St. Charles, Naperville, Lake Zurich and Lisle who have volunteered, donated and served on the
board to help those kids. Lots of people in that field have good things to say about Deuel and Jamal
Place.
But when the new fiscal year begins on July 1, the Illinois Department of Children and Family
Services will not renew its contract with Jamal Place, forcing those kids to go to other facilities.
""To shut us down and deny kids this opportunity is unconscionable,"" says Deuel, as she takes a deep
breath and dabs at her eyes in an attempt to keep her emotions in check.
She and her staff operated last year through a $1,041,000 contract with DCFS to provide a group
home for 10 wards of the state. They've carved out a wonderful reputation in 15 years, so what
happened?
The easy answer is that DCFS put the group home under a new performance-based contracting
system that determined Jamal Place fell short of benchmarks for keeping kids from running away,
requiring hospitalization or ending up in juvenile detention.
""Taxpayers expect and deserve positive results in the children we serve,"" says DCFS spokesman
Kendall Marlowe. Jamal Place simply didn't measure up in the areas the state measures.
Because Illinois has trimmed the number of wards of the state from a high of 52,000 in 1997 to only
15,500, a much higher percentage of those kids have mental illnesses, substance abuse or other
problems. Since the state measures an agency's performance by days that the kids are physically
present in the home, Jamal Place, with its small population, got bad marks when a child was
hospitalized for a mental-health issue or detained by a judge.
""We did what was clinically advisable for these children and we got dinged for it,"" says Brian Barclay,
assistant executive director of Jamal Place. ""We did what was in kids' best interest.""
There is no consideration given for ""incremental improvements in youth behavior, which occur as
trusting relationships develop,"" Deuel notes. ""I wish they could find a way to measure the individual
aspects.""
When compared with similar facilities, Jamal Place graded lower, Marlowe says, adding that it ""isn't a
happy day"" when the state ends an agreement with a facility that has ""good people"" and has done
""good work"" in the past. He says DCFS did renew a contract with Deuel for a different transitional
living facility that serves an older population.
One of Jamal Place's ""unfavorable"" outcomes involves a kid who already had a criminal record when
he came to the group home at age 14. Now 17, he says he ended up in juvenile court after he made a
mistake by hanging with the wrong people on the day when he stole a woman's purse.
""I've got a good relationship with the staff and residents. We did things as a family,"" says the teen,
who now is living with a grandmother. ""I love my grandmother, but I'd rather be at Jamal Place. I'm
trying to do everything in my power to get back to Jamal Place.""
Intangibles aren't part of the bureaucratic process. There isn't a place on an evaluation form to give
credit to Deuel and her staff for leading the effort that closed a local ""crack house."" There's no way to
measure the improvements in a former resident that led him for the first time to sign ""love"" before his
name on the Mother's Day card he sent Deuel this year. There's no scoresheet for the local gang
leader who stopped preying on Jamal kids when he was confronted by Deuel and recognized her as
the woman who gave him a Christmas present a few years earlier. The interview for this story is
interrupted when that man calls Deuel, who is helping him find a legitimate job.
""It is enormously frustrating to me that the attachment the boys develop with our staff members is not
a 'measurable' outcome,"" Deuel says. ""These are our children. Long after DCFS is done with these
kids, our door is still open.""
Last weekend, many former residents came back to explain how Jamal Place helped them. On June
26, Jamal Place will celebrate its 15th anniversary with a picnic and walkathon in Douglas Park,
across the street from the home. Deuel and her staff are hoping DCFS finds a way to give them more
time, another year to continue its mission.
""I've always maintained that God won't let us fail,"" says Deuel. ""For 15 years, that's been the case,
and now we've got this challenge.""","['Delano', 'Omorinsola', 'Arlington', 'Heights', 'Jamal', 'Place', 'S.', 'California', 'Ave.', 'North', 'Lawndale', 'Chicago', 'St.', 'Charles', 'Naperville', 'Lake', 'Zurich', 'Lisle', 'Illinois', 'Jamal', 'Place', 'Douglas', 'Park']"

5132,"Background on the Women Deliver Conference CONTEXT The second Women Deliver conference will take place in
Washington, DC on June 7-9, 2010. This conference is an international gathering that focuses on maternal health and
will include an estimated 3,000 representatives from governments, civil society, multilateral organizations, and the
private sector. The aim of the conference is to generate political commitment and financial investment for fulfilling
Millennium Development Goal 5, which pledges a three-quarter reduction in maternal mortality and universal access to
reproductive health by 2015. The conference is one of several international gatherings this year that will include a focus
on maternal and child health (MCH). As you know, this issue will also feature at the G-8, where the Canadians are
offering a flagship initiative on MCH, and at the Millennium Development Goals Summit in September, where the UN
Secretary General is sponsoring a Joint Effort on Women and Children's Health. The US will be represented at the
Women Deliver conference by Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius, Undersecretary of State Maria
Otero, Ambassador Melanne Verveer, and a host of other USG participants. Please note: You recently recorded a video
message that will open the conference.
The full script is below.
SUGGESTED TALKING POINTS
• For too long and in too many places, women have received inadequate care when they give birth. As a result,
childbirth remains a leading cause of death and injury to women worldwide. • The United States has elevated the
issue of maternal health in our development work through the Global Health Initiative, a $63 billion dollar proposal to
help countries improve health outcomes through strengthened health systems and integrated service delivery, with a
particular focus on the health of women, newborns and children. This conference—along with other international
gatherings this year, including the G-8 and the Millennium Development Goals Summit in September—presents a unique
opportunity to reinvigorate our commitment to maternal health. • When women prosper, their families and
communities prosper. Women deliver for the world – now the world needs to deliver for them. ADDITIONAL
BACKGROUND The theme of this year's Women Deliver conference is ""Delivering Solutions for Girls and Women,"" with a
focus on political, economic, social/cultural, and technological solutions. Conference organizers plan to emphasize the
following messages:1) The Millennium Development Goals will not be achieved without investing in
women.2) There is just enough time, if the world commits funding now, to achieve Millennium Development Goal 5—
an additional US $10 billion annually by 2010 and US $20 billion by 2015.Women Deliver was launched at a conference
in London in 2007. Jill Sheffield is the President of the organization.
FINAL VIDEO SCRIPT WOMEN DELIVER CONFERENCEWASHINGTON, DC
I am delighted to welcome all of you to this conference and to thank you for the work you are doing to put maternal
health at the top of our development agenda. Your commitment to this issue has raised awareness and inspired action
around the world. We know that women represent our greatest opportunity for progress in this century. If the potential
of women is fully developed, everyone benefits. And this can't be done without improving maternal health. But for too
long and in too many places, women have received inadequate care when they give birth. As a result, childbirth remains
a leading cause of death and injury to women worldwide. The United States has elevated this issue in our development
work through the Global Health Initiative, a 63 billion dollar proposal to help countries improve health outcomes
through strengthened health systems, with a particular focus on the health of women, newborns and children. We
commend the Canadian government for focusing much-needed attention to this issue by offering a flagship initiative on
maternal and child health at the upcoming G-8 meeting in Muskoka. The US also congratulates the United Nations
Secretary General for convening governments, civil society, multilateral organizations, foundations and corporations to
engage in a much-needed global effort to promote women's and children's health. These efforts—and this conference—
present a unique opportunity to reinvigorate our commitment to maternal health, because when women prosper, their
families and communities prosper. Women deliver for the world – now the world needs to deliver for them. Thank you.","['Washington', ',', 'DC', 'US', 'United', 'States', 'US', 'US', 'London', 'United', 'States', 'Muskoka', 'US']"

confident from the get-go that he would support the deal.
PM Brown praised all parties involved; stressed the need to adhere to the dates laid out in
the agreement several times; welcomed the supportive Westminster interventions during the Q
and A of SDLP Mark Durkan and DUP Peter Robinson and Nigel Dods, but pointedly expressed hope
that other parties (read UUP, whose MP was either not present or simply didn't speak) would
express their support as soon as possible.
As expected, David Cameron praised the agreement and all parties; raised the desire that all
parties (read SDLP and UUP) be given time to review the document; and pointedly asked the PM
what issues that were not expressly mentioned in the agreement would be addressed by the
Working Group -- to which Brown responded, ""all the issues outstanding from St Andrew's.""
Cameron and Brown praised the U.S. role, singling you out. Brown also twice referred to your

the minority parties have a chance to review and some questions on outstanding issues.

I wanted to tell you that I met with the Lithuanian official who is heading up the Community of Democracies. Lithuania
has the lead for the next two years. They are extremely energetic and recognize that CD needs to be reinvigorated. It
was not given much leadership from us during the Bush years and besides democracy got a bad name — among other
reasons. Their plan is to create a few working groups focused on issues that are current and important with specific
practical goals and tangible results — among them, one will be focused on women and their critical role. As you know,
they have a female president, the EU has just established a Gender Institute in Vilnius and they remember Vital Voices
when you headed up the conference in Iceland and the successor conference which was held in Lithuania in 2001. We
talked about a more concerted commitment -- to advocating for women and the role they need to play in conflict
resolution (1325), helping women in Afghanistan and working to help women in eastern Europe and the Caucuses where
things appear to be going backwards in many ways (takes me back to our first-ever VV conference in Vienna).
I agreed that we would co-chair the gender working group with Lithuania.
The Lithuanians believe that in many ways the younger generation takes for granted what the older generation fought
for (they remember being a ""Captive Nation and how the US kept them going with an embassy when they was little
likelihood at the time that they'd ever become a democracy), and that today democracies are struggling in too many
places. It's as though we have to take back democracy's good name and focus it as a universal value to address the
critical challenges.
Mike Posner has the lead on CD. I talked to him about all of this. He is all for our doing the gender working group as
something tangible. He is concerned about where the Community of Democracies goes more broadly. Since this was a
creation of the Clinton Administration and since democracy is under siege in so many places, I hope we will find a way to
work with the Lithuanians and others who still want to see it make a difference. In some ways it may be more relevant
today. They are planning the first ministerial in Krakow in July and hoping so much that you will be a part of it.
Assuming I can get there, I'm going to their embassy in the morning where several government reps of participating
countries will be meeting to announce next steps, including the gender working group.","['Lithuania', 'Vilnius', 'Iceland', 'Lithuania', 'Afghanistan', 'Europe', 'Vienna', 'Lithuania', 'US', 'Krakow']"

wavering in his faithful commitment to the country he loved and the men and women who bravely defend her. In war
and in peace, he fought for what he knew was right, even when it was unpopular. He was a fierce advocate for working
families struggling with a changing economy and for better health care and equipment for servicemembers. And over
the course of more than three decades in Congress, he became one of our nation's most respected voices on national
security and foreign policy. Presidents of both parties sought his advice and generations of colleagues looked to him for
leadership and wisdom. As Senator from New York serving on the Armed Services Committee, I was fortunate to call
Jack a friend and mentor. And as Secretary of State, I continued to rely on his expertise and judgment. I knew that Jack
would always shoot straight, like the Marine he was, and never shy away from a difficult question or a tough fight. Today
our country has lost a decorated war hero and a distinguished public servant. The men and women of the our armed
forces have lost a tireless champion. And the people of Pennsylvania's 12th district have lost a neighbor, an advocate,

Brazilian FM defends dialogue with Iran
BRASILIA, Feb. 9 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim said Tuesday Brazil would maintain negotiations
with Iran on uranium enrichment and oppose any sanctions against Iran.
Amorim said Brazil was against the production of nuclear weapons, but Iran had the right to carry out a peaceful nuclear
program.
""Dialogue is still possible. What we want is to make sure (that the uranium will not be used to make weapons) through
peaceful ways and dialogue,"" Amorim told reporters.
Under a draft deal brokered by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the UN nuclear watchdog, most of Iran's
existing low-grade enriched uranium should be shipped to Russia and France, where it would be processed into fuel rods
with a purity of 20 percent.
Iran declared on Tuesday it had started the process of producing 20-percent enriched uranium inside the country.
In response to Iran's announcement, the U.S.-led Western countries have warned to take political and economic
sanctions against Iran.
For his part, Amorim said he considered any kind of sanctions ineffective and dangerous because they might cross a limit
and jeopardize peace.
Iran's president made an official visit to Brazil in November, during which the Brazilian government defended Iran's right
to have its own peaceful nuclear program including uranium enrichment similar to Brazil's, following international
standards.","['Iran', 'BRASILIA', 'Brazil', 'Iran', 'Iran', 'Brazil', 'Iran', 'Russia', 'France', 'Iran', 'Iran', 'Iran', 'Iran', 'Brazil', 'Iran', 'Brazil']"

ADOPTION I Hillary Clinton continues to hail an adoption home she helped open with Mother Teresa that has since
closed its doors By Emily Belz
WASHINGTON—An adoption ministry Secretary of State Hillary Clinton hailed as a home she helped open with Mother
Teresa no longer handles adoptions and its phone line has been disconnected, though at last week's National Prayer
Breakfast Clinton spent five minutes of her 30-minute speech relating the story of its opening. Last Thursday Clinton
described Mother Teresa ""beaming about what this meant for children and their futures,"" seemingly oblivious that the
Mother Teresa Home for Infant Children in northwest Washington, D.C., is now defunct. She said she worked tirelessly
to ""cut through all the red tape,"" although it appears that red tape prevented the work from continuing. According to a
pastor at the church next door to the home's former location, the adoption ministry failed to take off because the
Roman Catholic nuns who ran it weren't allowed to care for babies without medical personnel on site. ""I'm not sure the
legal thing that came down upon them, but they realized they needed to expend their energies in another way,"" said
Maureen Freshour, who along with her husband, David, pastors Chevy Chase Baptist Church and lives nearby. Freshour
has stayed in touch with the nuns from the Missionaries of Charity order who ran the home and said that the remaining
three or four sisters have moved to another house in Washington, where they are ministering to the homeless.""This has
been a core issue—adoption—whether the home [Clinton] talked about survived or not,"" said Chuck Johnson, chief
operating officer of the National Council for Adoption. ""It's an issue she's been consistent on.""During her speech on
Thursday, Clinton reminisced about the 1994 National Prayer Breakfast when she attended as first lady and Mother
Teresa was the speaker. The Roman Catholic nun delivered a blistering speech about abortion, saying, ""Any country that
accepts abortion is not teaching its people to love, but to use any violence to get what they want."" Mother Teresa then
called on attendees to fight abortion through adoption: ""Please don't kill the child. I want the child. Please give me the
child.""The audience that day gave her a standing ovation—but President and Mrs. Clinton, both pro-abortion, did not
stand. Afterward, Mother Teresa asked to meet with Hillary Clinton and they went to talk behind a curtain on the stage,
sitting on folding chairs, Mother Teresa in sandals even though it was winter.""She told me that she knew that we had a
shared conviction about adoption being vastly better as a choice for unplanned or unwanted babies,"" Clinton related last
Thursday. ""And she asked me—or more properly, she directed me—to work with her to create a home for such babies
here in Washington.""Clinton followed through and set up a home for unwanted babies in Washington in just over a year,
no small feat in a city that was known then for its inefficient and corrupt bureaucracy. The Mother Teresa Home for
Infant Children opened in June 1995 in the district's affluent Chevy Chase neighborhood to house eight pregnant
mothers and their babies—but it remains unclear whether it facilitated any adoptions.I called the Missionaries of Charity
in Washington, a worldwide Roman Catholic order established by Mother Teresa. The nun who answered the phone said
she couldn't give her name because they aren't allowed to talk to the press. She did say, however, that the sisters who
are in the order now were not in the order when the adoption home opened, so she wasn't sure why it closed. She
added that the order sold the Chevy Chase house in 2002. ""We work with the poor and we didn't have any work there
because it's a rich neighborhood,"" she said. The sisters, she added, are now working with the homeless and those with
AIDS in a more transitional neighborhood in the northeast section of town on Otis Street.

An FT interview with Hillary Clinton
By Daniel Dombey
FT
June 11 2010 22:21
This is what it is like to be Hillary Clinton. The motorcade, twisting and skidding through rain-splashed
streets for more than an hour; the public meetings and camera lights at journey's end; the spotlight that
has not let up for two decades. It is almost as if the 2008 US presidential election - hailed as the most
exciting for a generation - had never ended.
But this is a campaign without a vote. Today, Clinton's convoy is snaking through Sao Paulo, Brazil, not
South Hampton, New Hampshire. She herself is no longer an aspirant for the White House, despite what
the overnight flights, town hall meetings and strategy sessions that make up her gruelling schedule might
suggest. Instead, she is in Latin America to shore up relations with the region and promote a new idea of
US leadership, one very much built around herself.
She's had bigger and more ecstatic audiences than the 700-odd students and staff crammed into the hall
tonight at Zumbi dos Pradares, an Afro-Brazilian university, but she's still greeted by a wave of raised
arms as the audience snaps away at her with their mobile phones.
In the convoy moments before, she was wrapped in a shawl, suffering from a cold and angry at the delays
that pushed us into the side streets speckled with box-like bars, warehouses and love hotels while
Brazilian motorists sought to cut into our path. There is no sign of that now. With the metabolism of a
born politician, she feeds off the energy of her audience and takes questions from students, teachers and
local celebrities for an hour. Hillary Clinton never looks happier than when she is centre stage.
Most US secretaries of state wouldn't bother with this sort of event, much less initiate it and arrange for it
to be screened on the biggest local channel. Yet this is what Clinton does on almost every foreign trip -
and she seems to spend half her life on her official 727, crammed with long-time aides and armed
bodyguards. The schedule is backbreaking and constantly shifting. She has notched up more than a
quarter of a million miles since taking office.
On this Latin America trip, thrown into confusion by an earthquake in Chile, we have already visited four
countries in 24 hours. We go to tiny Uruguay, where our stay is so brief we check into a hotel just for a
shower; Argentina, where we spend almost all our time at the presidential palace; Chile itself, where we
don't leave the airport; and Brazil, where we spend almost a full day.
So what exactly is Clinton trying to do on this never-ending world tour? Travelling with her for a week,
talking to people inside and outside the administration, I tried to find out.
""We now have a case to make and it is not just a case that is made to the president or the prime minister
or the foreign minister or an ambassador,"" she tells me a few weeks later, as she perches on a sofa in her
expansive office, with its view of the Lincoln Memorial. ""People now have a voice and an opinion and a
vote in many instances on the direction that their own societies take ... I want to model a different kind of
leadership that is open and willing to listen but [also] to stand our ground if necessary.""
She argues that these trips of hers help to restore the US's image in the wake of the Bush administration
- by making contact with public opinion abroad, and so boosting American power. Her aides say that, as a
battle-hardened politician who also happens to be one of the most famous women in the world, she is
ideally placed to carry out the task. But the deeper question is whether she is merely implementing the
foreign policy crafted by Barack Obama, her boss and former rival, or whether her role - and ambitions -
go beyond that.
Is she a kind of saleswoman-in-chief for the US, I ask? ""Well, I think that is part of the job,"" she replies,
toying with the napkin underneath her glass of water. ""If you are making a case for American values and
for American leadership, you have to make it where people now get information ... Given the bridges we
had to build and some of the repair work we had to do, we had to travel.""
As in S'ao Paulo, her system is under strain - ""I've been fighting this all day,"" she says as she masks a
cough set off by her allergies (Washington's cherry blossom trees are shedding their flowers). Life is still
hectic - the volcanic ash cloud has just all but paralysed Europe and televisions throughout the State
Department are showing the first British election debate. But Clinton remains enthusiastic, affable and
unhurried, her speech peppered with exclamations such as ""oh my gosh"", even as she discusses issues of
state. She politely asks if I have any updates for her about Europe's airspace shutdown and tells me she's
been talking to Norway's foreign minister about it.
""He said that this dust gets into engines of any size, even Air Force One - it's chunky! I don't know how
else to describe it,"" she says, an odd note of hilarity entering her voice as she pronounces the word
""chunky"".
Clinton often speaks in this eager, unvarnished way - a world away from the clipped, on-message manner
of her immediate predecessor in the post, Condoleezza Rice. If anything, she is an undiplomat - known
less for calibrated circumlocutions than for her plain speaking and sometimes her gaffes, a woman who
retains both a formidable political constituency and a laugh she once admitted can send cats scurrying
from a room.
Her staff point out she is only the third elected politician in 60 years to have served as secretary of state,
and the first to come from outside the foreign policy establishment since James Baker, George H.W.
Bush's right-hand man and perhaps her most illustrious recent predecessor. She may be the most
substantive politician in the office since William Jennings Bryan, the three-time presidential candidate who
served as secretary almost a century ago. ""Her stature on the world stage, her almost presidential
stature, has set her apart,"" Bill Burns, the top career diplomat at the State Department, tells me. ""Leaders
want to meet her. And the town hall meetings do make a difference with public opinion.""
State visitor Hillary Clinton is greeted by Air Force Base Commander Colonel Celso de Araujo at S'ao Paulo
airport in March
Back in Sao Paulo, the meeting at the university ranges far from the confines and dramatis personae of
traditional diplomacy. Annie, a young woman with red and blue dreadlocked hair, tells Clinton about her
dance and percussion classes and asks how to study in the US without paying college fees. A nervous
young man confesses himself lost halfway through an abstruse question about tariff policy; Clinton,
smiling and nodding in that vaguely automatic way of hers, bears with him all the same. Another female
student asks for an autograph. When answering, Clinton sometimes opens her eyes wide as she
emphasises a phrase; at other moments, seemingly at random, she pulls her hands apart as if
demonstrating the size of a fish.
Then a law student called Marina asks about abortion - which is illegal in Brazil - and Clinton moves into
treacherous terrain. She speaks of the Brazilian hospital she visited in the 1990s that treated not just
expectant mothers but women suffering from the consequences of backstreet abortions. ""Wealthy women
have rights in every country,"" she says. ""And poor women don't."" Her strength of feeling can't be hidden
as she denounces ""the great toll that illegal abortions take and the denial of women being able to exercise
such a fundamental personal right"".
Tom Shannon, the US ambassador to Brazil, tells me later: ""I understand the possible concern that we
might have come close to domestic issues. But she wasn't laying out a prescription for Brazil. She was
sharing her experience as a woman in American politics and as secretary of state."" It's true: Clinton
doesn't quite cross the line. Onstage, she is controlled without seeming artificial, convivial without
appearing over-effusive, what a previous age would call a real trouper. At the podium she looks straight
ahead, her lips carefully expressionless. Still, the old competitive instincts haven't left her. Perhaps it is
the lecterns at press conferences, reminiscent of the Democratic presidential debates, but on exiting the
podium at a joint appearance with Argentina's president Cristina Fernandez, Clinton makes clear her
satisfaction at having had the last word. The expert debater who usually bested Obama has not left the
stage.
Yet that competitive urge coexists with what one insider describes as her ""almost inhuman loyalty""
towards Obama. Her mastery of the facts - an ""information carnivore"" one of her officials calls her -
comes despite the consensus in much of Washington that her role consists largely of implementing the
foreign policy Obama and his inner circle have framed, rather than helping frame it herself.
In Sao Paulo, she shows her loyalty in striking fashion when she is asked repeatedly about positive
discrimination - another sensitive topic in Brazil - not least because, Clinton herself observes, Afro-
Brazilians account for more than half the country's population but only 2 per cent of university students.
""That suggests to me that some special steps need to be taken [in] recruiting and admitting students so
that they can have a chance to succeed,"" she tells the hall, again inching towards domestic politics, before
speaking of her pride in the progress the US civil rights movement has made in the past half-century. She
says: ""The election of Barack Obama, many believe, was the greatest accomplishment of all because it
demonstrated that an African-American could be elected president of the United States.""
Among the crowd, I catch my breath and scribble down her words. It's hard to think of a more fulsome
statement from the woman who fought so hard against Obama - and who squandered a huge poll lead
and millions of dollars in the struggle against him.
The great collaborator Clinton has established strong working relationships within the Obama
administration
When I ask Clinton later about how she managed to move from the antagonism of the primary race to the
obedience of office, she dismisses my question with an anodyne ""that's politics"". She adds: ""We're
working really hard and well together ... It just never comes up any more, it seems like ancient history to
me."" Not so ancient, I think, that she is willing to admit the failings of her campaign. ""I always run
inclusive and successful organisations,"" she retorts when I ask her whether she'd applied any lessons from
that searing experience to her new post.
She admits she didn't want the job at State - she says she was exhausted by the election and missed the
Senate -. ""but at the end of the day, I'm pretty old-fashioned and if the president asks you to do
something, you'd better have a really good reason why you can't."" Also, she adds: ""Suppose I had won
and I were asking him to be in my cabinet ... I would have wanted him to say yes.""
Others say the relationship is more complex, that by dint of her loyalty and unflagging hard work, Clinton
has moved closer to the charmed circle and made herself an even more formidable political force than
before. ""Quite simply, she gives good advice and the president over a year and a half has recognised
that,"" says Anne-Marie Slaughter, head of the State Department policy planning unit. ""The relationship is
based on her performance in the job.""
By all accounts, it's a collaborative partnership, though not perhaps a warm one. Clinton boasts a good
working relationship with the main players of the administration - and has formed something of an
alliance with defence secretary Robert Gates, although on life-and-death issues such as Afghanistan, it is
Gates, not her, who has taken the lead. As one official told me, secretaries of state have often either been
popular with their own department - Colin Powell comes to mind - or with the rest of the administration -
as was Condoleezza Rice - but Clinton has managed to be both.
In truth, Clinton's language remains harder-edged than Obama's - she recently claimed that Iran's
Revolutionary Guard had staged a slow-motion coup - and she has sometimes been more willing than he
is to hint at using the military. ""She seems to step up with a bit of spine just at the right time,"" says Kurt
Volker, a US ambassador to Nato under George W. Bush.
She has also assumed an ever more prominent role in talking to leaders such as Benjamin Netanyahu of
Israel and Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan - apparently because she is trusted both by them and Obama.
Meanwhile, she has been careful to keep her husband, the former US president, in the background. Aides
say they have barely seen him in the building - though Clinton herself says that behind the scenes Bill
Clinton gives her strategic advice. ""One of his favourite sayings, that I remind myself of all the time, is a
kind of baseball saying,"" she says: ""Don't major in the minors; keep your eye on not just the headlines
but the trend lines.""
It is her co-operative stance rather than any notable effort to set out a grand vision of her own that is the
chief theme of her time so far at State. When I ask Clinton to name her proudest achievement in office,
she replies ""the effective and collaborative approach that this administration has taken towards identifying
and solving problems."" A more process-oriented, less provocative answer would be hard to imagine.
But maybe, I think, the US has less scope for grand strategy than it did in the past couple of decades,
when the country seemed to bestride the world colossus-style. Clinton herself suggests that so formidable
are the tasks confronting the US that the administration has little scope to enter into internecine fights but
needs instead to focus on the challenges to hand. Whatever the reason for her stance, it seems to be a
smart decision - by all accounts she's overcome many of the suspicions the White House retinue had
towards her.
""It's fair to say that she was not born into the administration's inner circle but slowly but surely, for the
most consequential decisions, she now has a prime seat at the table,"" says one official. Praising what he
calls her ""Terminator-quality durability and determination,"" he adds: ""She's done an amazing amount of
work, judging that the way to build a strategic vision is bottom up, by mastering the details.""
Indeed, Clinton's ability to master the most arcane foreign policy briefs is the marvel of her building. She
has dropped into obscure working groups and shown an unnerving knowledge of their details. At her
confirmation hearings last year she exchanged facts about the arctic with an Alaskan senator; at the
meeting in So Paulo she becomes enthused about freight transport policy both in Brazil and the US. She
herself acknowledges that finding her feet on foreign policy was something of a struggle, despite her
campaign claims of expertise in the field. ""It was so intellectually challenging, just to get our arms around
all of these issues,"" she says. During her first year, she was criticised for apparent gaffes - including the
way she called for Israel to halt all building of settlements on occupied territory only to hail a partial freeze
a few months later as unprecedented. On an election campaign, she says, ""you may be in a different city
four times a day but you have a message you're trying to deliver that is repetitive and aimed at your
audience. But here you might deal with 10 different countries' problems, six different regional or global
challenges in the course of a day.""
As the Latin America tour shows, she is now trying to do both - travel incessantly and solve an array of
international issues. She is at the forefront of the US's efforts to consolidate relations with a number of
important countries - predominantly Russia and China, but also rising powers such as Brazil, Turkey,
Indonesia and South Africa - and to cool down anti-American feeling in hotspots, notably Pakistan. She
says the push is working, hailing a ""change in public opinion in places that were pretty negative about the
US"" - a reference to Russia and Pakistan. But it is far from smooth sailing. Differences about Iran and
over Israel's raid on aid-bearing ships off Gaza have stoked tensions with Turkey and Brazil recently, amid
questioning of the effectiveness of the Obama administration's policies.
During my time with her on the road, the stop in Brazil is the focal point - not surprising given the
country's increased profile as Latin America leader. Clinton is now heading the administration's push to
secure sanctions on Iran, and in Brasilia she tries and fails to win President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva to her
cause. She employs an almost combative tone at a press conference with Celso Amorim, Brazil's foreign
minister. At moments she appears to barely contain her irritation, as she denounces ""an Iran that runs to
Brazil"" as well as other countries such as Turkey and China ""telling different things to different people to
avoid international sanctions"". Amorim is spiky in his own way - drawing parallels to the 1990s sanctions
on Iraq and the claims about weapons of mass destruction before the 2003 war. ""Of course, I don't agree
with everything the Secretary said,"" he says.
It is not a happy experience - indeed this past week both Brazil and Turkey voted against sanctions at the
United Nations - yet Hillary Clinton is nowhere near giving up. Years ago, one of Bill Clinton's biographers
described his approach to government as a ""permanent campaign"", and it appears to be his wife's
preferred form of existence as well. If there is one constant in Clinton's life, it is that she never throws in
her cards, whether what motivates her is power or public service.
""Never, never!"" she exclaims, when I ask whether she ever thought of walking off into the wings after the
frustrations and indignities of her time at the White House. ""I have a very realistic sense of what high-
stakes politics requires and it took me a while to get there because it's shocking when you are in the
arena ... but once you figure it out, you can take it seriously for purposes of analysis and understanding,
but you can't take it personally."" Such treatment seems to rankle all the same. She's been listening to
coverage ahead of the British debate and is plainly irritated by the coverage of the leaders' wives.
""Whether a woman's running for office or she's supporting her husband who's running for office and she
gets criticised for wearing open-toed shoes or for the colour of her coat, there's just a lot of history that
you bear if you are a woman who puts herself out in the political arena,"" she says.
Another country Clinton boards her official 727 to fly from Sao Paulo to Costa Rica
Injustice towards women appears to be the issue that most enthuses Clinton in this job - as in her many
other incarnations in American public life, whether as First Lady or before. ""I feel passionately it is in not
just the American national security interests but the world's, that women be given the opportunities and
the tools to make the most out of their own lives,"" she says.
In the 1990s she steered clear of reading the newspapers because of the way she was treated. Today, she
says, ""I certainly don't read coverage of me, I read what else is going on that I need to know about to do
my job."" ""It's all baloney,"" says Philippe Reines, her press adviser, who set up the meeting with her and is
sitting to one side in her office.
""Yeah, yeah, right, that's what he tells me,"" Clinton responds.
I wonder. She may not read the stories about her, but she has boosted her domestic profile still further by
talking to American magazines such as Esquire, Vogue and Parade. To what end? Clinton has said she will
only serve one four-year term as secretary of state - understandable, given the grind of the job. When I
ask whether she expects a woman president in the next decade or so, she responds: ""I'd love that,
obviously I would love that. I want to be front and centre when it happens.""
""Any chance it would be you?"" I ask.
""No, no, I don't think that's in the cards,"" Clinton says. She's given more categoric denials in the past. ""I
think that there's a whole generation of young women and not so young, but mature, seasoned women
who are earning their stripes and recognising how tough it is out there. It is not for the faint of heart to
run for president, and I believe it is harder for women, it just is, and that's just a fact."" But, says one US
official, ""all the profiles and all this media treatment undercut the argument that she is finished with
electoral politics. Why do all this stuff? She's already Hillary Clinton. You have to ask: 'What's the idea
behind raising her domestic profile still further?""
Indeed she is now, by some counts, the most popular politician in America and some in Washington say
she could be a good fit for the vice-presidential slot in the 2012 elections.
Back in Sao Paulo, once the town hall meeting is over, Clinton faces a seven-hour flight to Costa Rica. The
journey goes on and on, and as saleswoman-in-chief for the US in an unruly world, she faces a long, hard
road. Today the US sometimes struggles to assert itself on the world stage. But the obstacles are rather
fewer if the product she is pitching is herself. A secretary of state like none before her, Hillary Clinton,
long one of the most formidable figures in US politics, is looking stronger than ever.

David Miliband: ""Hillary is a rock star ... she has a great sense of fun, and a great sense of humour""
It's too early to start chalking up a scorecard because Hillary Clinton, and the Obama administration, is
laying the foundations for long-term change in America's foreign policy. The challenges are immense -
probably more difficult than the inheritance of any previous administration. But American leadership is
essential and a commitment to multilateralism - in fact multi, multilateralism using different and
overlapping forums - is real and right.
You also have to remember that Hillary is a rock star. When I arrived at the Nato Foreign Ministers
meeting in March 2009, it was a nice surprise that all the staff, never mind the press, seemed to have
turned out in droves for my arrival. Then I realised that Hillary was 10 minutes behind me.
That said, the thing that most surprised me about working with Clinton was not her intelligence or her
hard work, all of which are well known, but that behind the serious exterior is someone who has a great
sense of fun, and a great sense of humour. She has seen politics from all sides, and can laugh at herself
as well as at others.
She's a remarkably good listener, always synthesising ideas and opinions to develop her own. She thinks
strategically as well as tactically. She's also very, very unpompous. Hillary is a very political person but in
a particular way, she honours politics and public service and believes that democratic politics is not a
necessary evil, but a calling of value and vocation. She knows you win some and you lose some, but it's
essential to take part.
There's one other thing. Hillary is a people person in that she thinks deeply about the psychology of the
people she's dealing with. Their motivation, their loyalties, their culture. It's real emotional intelligence in
trying to understand why people disagree and how you can get them to agree. I think that must be why
so many other members of the administration say she is a very good colleague.

Gideon Rachman: ""Relations between the White House and the State Department are not particularly
close""
A school teacher asked to write a report on Hillary Clinton's stint as secretary of state would have to give
her 10/10 for effort but a rather more modest mark for actual achievements - maybe a six or a seven.
Secretaries of state are generally judged on two criteria. First, how have they done in the endless
bureaucratic turf wars that characterise Washington politics? Second, how effective have they been in
promoting US foreign policy in the wider world? Success in one area usually helps in the other. Henry
Kissinger was a superb Washington infighter - and his close relationship with President Nixon made him
all the more effective overseas. Colin Powell, George W. Bush's first secretary of state, was widely
admired outside the US - but came out on the wrong side of many of the Washington battles, which
limited his ability to get things done in the wider world.
Hillary Clinton has skilfully avoided being sucked into the debilitating Washington struggles that so
damaged Powell. Despite the often poisonous rivalry between the Obama and Clinton camps during the
campaign, Clinton has a good working relationship with the president. But while relations between the
White House and the State Department are cordial, they do not seem to be particularly close. Clinton
appointed many loyalists from her own campaign to the State Department, with the result that State is
rather detached from Obama's inner circle. Obama's penchant for making high-profile speeches in foreign
capitals such as Cairo, Prague, Tokyo and Istanbul means that the president himself has done more than
anyone else to define his administration's approach to the world.
That still leaves a role for Clinton to fill in the crucial details of policy. But special representatives have
been appointed to deal with Afghanistan and the Middle East - and the Treasury is critical to China policy.
Asked about Clinton's impact as secretary of state, one senior European policymaker purses his lips and
says: ""She's done some great trips, and she's highly professional. But it's hard to see any particular area
where she has really driven policy.""
Gideon Rachman is the FT's chief foreign affairs columnist
David Rothkopf: ""When she has been asked to deliver tough messages, she has done so unflinchingly""
Hillary Clinton has been a cautious secretary of state: she has protected the president well and pursued
his agenda without upstaging him - an early concern, given her stature. She has worked very well with
other members of the cabinet, and is reconsidering the role and structure of the State Department.
That includes a review of the role of diplomacy going forward. Clinton has not only acknowledged the rise
of new powers and a changing global power structure but has taken steps to reshape US foreign policy
structure accordingly. An important part of that has been recognising the importance of co-operating with
private and non-state actors such as NG0s, as well as dealing with non-state threats.
When the administration has called upon her to deliver tough messages, she has done so unflinchingly.
This has allowed the president to articulate a strategic vision which Clinton then goes about implementing.
Still, neither the secretary of state nor the president determines the global situation. The US may be the
most powerful country in the world but it is one among many powerful countries, and many aspects of the
situation we face today are beyond our control. The Obama administration has been dealt an extremely
difficult hand: not only Iraq and Afghanistan, but Iran and North Korea's nuclear programmes, the rise of
emerging powers and a complex and still unfolding series of financial crises.
We have gone from a world in which the US thought it had limitless resources and unbounded options to
one where the limits are clear; from a world in which you could work in the GB to one where you have to
work in the context of the G20; a world where new technologies and new powers play a bigger role. All of
those things would dictate a change in foreign policy regardless of who is in office.
Hillary Clinton has established a very solid foundation. The next step is to identify a couple of signature
issues - and have a couple of signature successes. That will take her to the next level.

Aides to U.S. general in Afghanistan slam Obama:
report
20 mins ago
WASHINGTON (Reuters) — Aides to the top U.S. general in Afghanistan insulted some of President Barack Obama's closest advisers,
calling one a ""clown"" and another a ""wounded animal,"" in an article to be published Friday in Rolling Stone magazine.
The article also quotes an aide describing the commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan General Stanley McChrystal's
""disappointment"" with his initial one-on-one meeting with Obama last year.
Quoting all the McChrystal aides anonymously, the article portrays a split between the U.S. military and Obama's advisers at an
extremely sensitive moment for the Pentagon, which is fending off criticism of its strategy to turn around the nearly nine-year-old
Afghan war.
The Pentagon had no immediate comment about the article, which has been brought to the attention of senior officials.
It quotes a member of McChrystal's team making jokes about Vice President Joe Biden, who was seen as critical of the general's
efforts to escalate the conflict and who had favored a more limited counter-terrorism approach.
""Biden?"" the aide was quoted as saying. ""Did you say: Bite me?""
Another aide called White House National Security Adviser Jim Jones, a retired four star general, a ""clown"" who was ""stuck in 1985.""
It quoted an adviser to McChrystal dismissing an early meeting with Obama as a ""10-minute photo op.""
""Obama clearly didn't know anything about him, who he was. The boss was pretty disappointed,"" the adviser told the magazine.
McChrystal, a famous workaholic said to sleep just four hours a day, was brought into Afghanistan a year ago after his predecessor
was pushed out.
The article portrays his teams as disapproving of the Obama administration, with the exception of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton,
who backed McCrystal's request for additional troops in Afghanistan.
Some of the strongest criticism was reserved for Richard Holbrooke, Obama's special envoy to Afghanistan and Pakistan.
""The boss says he's like a wounded animal,"" a member of the general's team is quoted as saying. ""Holbrooke keeps hearing rumors
that he's going to get fired, so that makes him dangerous.""
McChrystal was quoted as saying he felt ""betrayed"" by the leak of a classified cable from U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan Karl
Eikenberry last year. The cable raised doubts about sending more troops to shore up an Afghan government already lacking in
credibility.
""I like Karl, I've known him for years, but they'd never said anything like that to us before,"" McChrystal was quoted as saying in the
article.
""Here's one that covers his flank for the history books. Now if we fail, they can say, 'I told you so.""

McChrystal's Next Offensive?
Relations between the U.S. military and civilians in the Obama administration have been tense since last year's three-month review of Afghan war strategy, a state of affairs
unlikely to be helped by a new profile of Gen. Stanley McChrystal, the overall commander in Afghanistan, that will appear in Rolling Stone magazine on Friday.
In the eight-page article, released to reporters on Monday ahead of publication, McChrystal appears to belittle Vice President Joe Biden and accuses Karl Eikenberry, the U.S.
ambassador to Kabul, of undermining his war plan within the administration.
Asked by the Rolling Stone reporter about what he now feels of the war strategy advocated by Biden last fall — fewer troops, more drone attacks — the article reports that
McChrystal and his aides attempted to come up with a good one-liner to dismiss the question. ""Are you asking about Vice President Biden?"" McChrystal reportedly jokes. ""Who's
that?""
Later in the article, McChrystal turns more serious when asked about cables sent last fall to Washington by Eikenberry. The cables called into question the major troop increase
advocated by McChrystal's team and the U.S.'s backing of Afghan President Hamid Karzai — views that the ambassador had not previously raised with McChrystal or his staff.
""I like Karl, I've known him for years, but they'd never said anything like that to us before,"" McChrystal is quoted as saying. ""Here's one that covers his flank for the history
books. Now if we fail, they can say, 'I told you so.""
The article, titled ""The Runaway General,"" has already caused nervousness inside the Pentagon, where memories are still fresh of another blistering profile that got a top
commander in hot water: an August 2008 cover story in Esquire <hop://wvav.esquire.com/features/fox-fallon > on Adm. William ""Fox"" Fallon, then commander of all U.S.
forces in the Middle East and Central Asia. The article eventually played a part in Fallon's resignation two years ago.
In that Esquire piece, however, Fallon appeared to directly contradict White House policy on Iran and other parts of the Middle East; the Rolling Stone article makes no such
allegation, but rather is full of jokey put-downs of important Washington players.
Comments in the article attributed to anonymous McChrystal aides are particularly harsh towards some senior members of the Obama administration, including National Security
Adviser James Jones, and other leading politicians, like Sens. John Kerry (D., Mass.) and John McCain (R., Ariz). They also make some unflattering references to
PresidentBarack Obama himself, saying the president didn't seem to know who McChrystal was when he appointed him to run the war early last year.
Only Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who is portrayed as having strongly backed McChrystal's plan for Afghanistan, is singled out for praise by the anonymous McChrystal
aides.
A spokesman for McChrystal did not immediately respond to a request for comment late Monday.

Top US Afghan commander mocks Biden: report
(AFP) — 1 hour ago
WASHINGTON — The US commander in Afghanistan mocks the vice president and denounces a top diplomat in a magazine interview, while his aides
speak dismissively of President Barack Obama.
Tensions between General Stanley McChrystal and the White House are on full display in an unflattering profile in Rolling Stone of the commander of US
and NATO forces in the Afghan war.
McChrystal jokes sarcastically about preparing to answer a question referring to Vice President Joe Biden, known as a skeptic of the commander's war
strategy.
""Are you asking about Vice President Biden?' McChrystal says with a laugh. 'Who's that?'"" the article quotes him as saying.
""Biden?' suggests a top adviser. 'Did you say: Bite Me?""
McChrystal tells the magazine that he felt ""betrayed"" by the US ambassador to Kabul, Karl Eikenberry, in a White House debate over war strategy last year.
Referring to a leaked internal memo from Eikenberry that questioned McChrystal's request for more troops, the commander suggested the ambassador had
tried to protect himself for history's sake.
""I like Karl, I've known him for years, but they'd never said anything like that to us before,"" McChrystal tells the magazine.
""Here's one that covers his flank for the history books. Now if we fail, they can say, ?I told you so.""
Eikenberry, himself a former commander in Afghanisan, had written to the White House saying Afghan President Hamid Karzai was an unreliable partner
and that a surge of troops could draw the United States into a open-ended quagmire.
The article revisits the friction between the White House and the military last fall as Obama debated whether to grant McChrystal's request for tens of
thousands of reinforcements.
Although Obama in the end granted most of what McChrystal asked for, the strategy review was a difficult time, the general tells the magazine.
""I found that time painful,"" McChrystal says. ""I was selling an unsellable position.""
An unnamed adviser to McChrystal alleges the general came away unimpressed after a meeting with Obama in the Oval Office a year ago, just after the
president named him to take over in Afghanistan.
""It was a 10-minute photo op,"" the general's adviser says.
""Obama clearly didn?t know anything about him, who he was.., he didn?t seem very engaged.
""The boss was pretty disappointed,"" says the adviser.
The profile, titled ""The Runaway General,"" portrays his aides as profane and intensely loyal to McChrystal, while arguing the general has seized control over
the war on the military and diplomatic fronts.
The four-star general also derides the hard-charging top US envoy to the region, Richard Holbrooke, and complains about a dinner with an unnamed French
minister during a visit to Paris.
""Oh, not another e-mail from Holbrooke,"" McChrystal says, looking at his messages on a mobile phone. ""I don't even want to open it.""
In a hotel room in Paris getting ready for a dinner with a French official, McChrystal says: ""How'd I get screwed into going to this dinner?""
""The dinner comes with the position, sir,"" says his aide, Colonel Charlie Flynn.
""Hey, Charlie,"" McChrystal says, ""does this come with the position?""
McChrystal gives him the middle finger.

FW: Rahm's long goodbye
Rahm's long goodbye
By: Glenn Thrush
June 22, 2010 04:34 AM EDT
For all the talk about Rahm Emanuel reaching for the ""eject"" button, the fiery White House
chief of staff isn't leaving in the immediate future — and could serve well into 2011,
according to people close to him.
""It's the opinion in the top levels of the White House that Rahm is going to be here longer
than many people think,"" said a senior administration official, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
Speculation about Emanuel's departure has been a favorite parlor game for nearly a year
— stoked by Emanuel's admission that he'd love to run for Chicago mayor (should current'
Mayor Richard Daley retire, of course), his own kvetching about the rigors of the job,
withering attacks on him from the left and the right and the fact that the average expiration
date on a chief of staff is 18 months.
Emanuel is leaving, but his departure date has proved to be profoundly elastic. Friends
and co-workers said he vacillates from day to day, sometimes minute to minute. He might
leave in December after the midterms; or he might stay until next summer, depending on
whether Daley runs or President Barack Obama asks him to stick around, they said.
And even as he pines for his native Chicago, Emanuel continues to put down real roots in
D.C., recently writing the check to enroll his children in the exclusive Maret School in
Washington through the 2011 school year, according to a person close to Emanuel.
He's shown few signs of loosening his grip on the tiller — bombarding White House
staffers with long-distance calls during the first days of the Gulf oil spill even as he
traveled in Israel for his son's bar mitzvah.
And in a broader sense, it's hard to imagine Emanuel's huge personality extracted from
the political, journalistic and bar stool life of Obama's Washington.
Take the last game of last week's NBA Finals, when any American voter could wander
into Tunnicliff's Tavern on Capitol Hill and witness one of the most powerful men in the
nation egging on the Boston Celtics — screaming at the flat-screen TV, actually — joined
by a merry band that included Sen. Max Baucus (D-Mont.); Sen. Chris Dodd (D-Conn.);
Jim Manley, spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.); and a pair of
favorite reporters from The New York Times and The Washington Post.
Despite a British tabloid story asserting that Emanuel is sick of Obama's ""idealism"" and is
racing for the exit, the former Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee chairman
still loves the attention and power of his current job and hasn't made up his mind when
he's leaving, people who know him said.
""This is BS. And if you need it for translation, it is baseless,"" Emanuel said in a statement
pushing back against a story in the U.K.'s Daily Telegraph portraying Emanuel as restless!
and fed up.
Replacing Emanuel, when he eventually goes, will be no easy task for Obama and the
small clique of close advisers led by Pete Rouse, David Axelrod and Valerie Jarrett.
For one thing, Obama and company need to know what the post-November political
landscape looks like before picking a successor: If Republicans take back one or more
house of Congress, the new chief of staff will need to know how to leverage executive
power against a hostile Hill; if Democrats retain their majorities, Emanuel's successor will
need some of his legislative skills.
Barring a major course correction, Obama, who prizes loyalty and familiarity, isn't likely to
reach too far outside his inner circle, advisers said.
Still, the president is increasingly cognizant of his reputation for insularity and would quite
likely give a serious look at respected former Clinton chiefs of staff Leon Panetta, currenW
head of the CIA, or John Podesta, who runs the Center for American Progress, a major
liberal think tank with close ties to the administration.
Rouse, a senior adviser who served as Obama's Senate chief of staff, is considered the
best pure manager in the White House and a logical choice to replace Emanuel, according
to a half-dozen.administration officials and consultants.
But Rouse's colleagues say the quiet 60-year-old insider loves his work, the Grateful Dead
and his cats — but despises the spotlight and would most likely turn down the job unless
Obama insisted.
""The key thing about Pete is that the president trusts him and would feel very, very
comfortable with him in charge,"" said a Democratic consultant who knows both men well.
""But he probably won't take it.""
One possible candidate — deputy chief of staff Jim Messina, Emanuel's political go-to guy
— is likely to play a major role in Obama's 2012 reelection campaign and is expected to
move to Chicago sometime next year.
In Messina's absence, another Emanuel favorite — Deputy National Security Adviser Tom
Donilon — has emerged as a possible successor, according to people close to the
situation.
Obama has been impressed by Donilon's presentations at the President's Daily Briefing,
and the Rhode Island native has a wide variety of political and governmental experience,
serving as a congressional liaison under President Jimmy Carter, chief State Department
spokesman under President Bill Clinton and a campaign adviser who helped Obama
prepare for debates against John McCain.
One major Donilon drawback: He served as an executive vice president for Fannie Mae,
the bailed-out mortgage giant, and reportedly lobbied against stronger regulatory
oversight.
David Plouffe, Obama's 2008 campaign manager, is another contender, with a reputation
for discipline, team building and solid management skills. But Plouffe has been reluctant to
settle down in Washington, is earning a stellar living as a consultant and hates the press.
Former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle is also a possible successor, even though
his nomination for Health and Human Services secretary was scuttled by revelations he
failed to report limo rides paid for by a corporate client.
Another White House aide, Phil Schiliro, is a favorite of Obama's for his legislative savvy
and political instincts. But critics said he lacks the range of policy and political experience
that other candidates possess, and that his mastery of the Hill won't mean much if
Democrats surrender their majorities in either house.
Then there's Ron Klain, 49, Vice President Joe Biden's brainy and politically astute chief
of staff, who is said to be intensely interested in making the move from the Eisenhower
Executive Office Building to the West Wing.
Klain — who also served as Al Gore's chief of staff — is well-regarded inside the White
House. Plus, he's got a touch of star power: Kevin Spacey played him in the HBO movie
""Recount,"" about his role in guiding the Gore campaign through the 2000 Florida recount.
Klain's downside: He's essentially an outsider who has yet to develop a serious rapport
with the president, according to insiders.

The Israeli Media's Flotilla Fail
On 06.22.10, By Max Blumenthal
My summaty of the Israeli media's shambolic performance following the flotilla massacre was originally published here in
Hebrew at Dvorit Shargal's excellent Israeli media blog, Velvet Underground. The English version follows:
If the raid of the Gaza Freedom Flotilla was a disaster for the Israel Defense Forces, its aftermath demonstrated an
equally bewildering performance by the Israeli media. The IDF Spokesman's Office churned out one misleading claim
after another, each one more implausible than the next, seeking to implant in the public's mind a version of events that
bore little relation to reality. To a degree, this was to be expected; but it was startling to see how some of Israel's most
respected reporters lined up to serve as military stenographers, barely challenging the IDF's rapidly changing versions of
events. IDF claims about the flotilla passengers' links to Al Qaida, anti-Semitic statements shouted at the Israeli Navy, and
their terrorist intentions were eagerly broadcast by the Israeli media without a second thought. When independent
reporters forced the IDF to retract or ""clarify"" all of these claims, Israeli news outlets refused to correct their errors, or
covered them up without acknowledgment.
It so happened that I arrived in Israel for a research trip the day after the flotilla raid. As a result, I was able to do
something which I always thought to be a very basic journalistic practice, so basic it's supposed to be applied routinely:
Asking an implicated party in a story to produce evidence for its claims. What I found bewildering is that at least judging
from Israeli media reports, few, if any, mainstream reporters applied this practice, and when a visiting colleague did their
job for them – nobody bothered to correct or withdraw their original report.
On June 2, the IDF disseminated a press release entitled, ""Attackers of the IDF soldiers found to be Al Qaeda
mercenaries."" The accusation was not accompanied by any conclusive evidence — the IDF reported that Mavi Marmara
passengers were equipped with night-vision goggles (gasp!). This did not stop Yedioth's Ron Ben-Yishai, who was
embedded with the Navy commandos, from amplifying the baseless charge. Citing an ""interrogation"" of Marmara
passengers — ""lynchers,"" he called them — Ben-Yishai wrote the same day, ""Some among the [flotilla passengers] are
believed to have ties with World Jihad groups, mainly Al Qaeda."" The article made no reference to any efforts on part of
Ben Yishai to investigate this claim, nor did he seem to think to ask why the IDF was about to release dangerous
operatives of Osama Bin Laden — presumably they would attack again, wouldn't they? •
On June 3, Israeli journalist Lia Tarachansky of the Real News Network and I placed calls to the IDF Spokesman's Office
to demand further evidence of the Marmara's Al Qaeda ties. We received identical responses from spokespeople from the
IDF's Israel and North America desks: ""We don't have any evidence. The press release was based on information from
the National Security Council."" Hours later, the IDF retracted its claim, changing the title of its press release to, ""Attackers
of IDF Soldiers Found Without Identification Papers."" Despite the official retraction, Ben-Yishai's article remains
uncorrected.
On June 4, the IDF released an audio clip purporting to consist of transmissions between the Mavi Marmara and a Naval
warship. ""Go back to Aushwitz!"" a Marmara passenger shouted, according to the IDF. YNet and Haaretz reported on and
reproduced the audio clip without investigating its authenticity. Forget that the voice uttering the anti-Semitic slur sounded
like a mentally disturbed teenager; had reporters performed a cursory search of the IDF Spokeman's Office website, they
would have found a longer clip released on May 31 that featured a dramatically different exchange with the Marmara with
no mention of Auschwitz. Further, the voice of flotilla organizer Huwaida Arraf was featured in the ""Aushwitz"" clip, yet Arraf
was not aboard the Marmara (she was on the Challenger One). Could the IDF have doctored audio to exploit public
hysteria surrounding the issue of anti-Semitism?
On my blog, I pointed out the discrepancies in the IDF's footage and raised the question of doctoring. The next day, the
IDF conceded that it had in fact doctored the footage, releasing a ""clarification"" and a new clip claiming to consist of the
""full"" exchange between the Navy and the flotilla. Unfortunately, the authenticity of the new clip was impossible to verify.
Despite the IDF's admission, YNet and Haaretz have not corrected their original reports, though Haaretz has at least
altered its headline. Once the doctoring was exposed, the New York Times covered the episode in detail, directing
international attention to the triumph of independent online reporting and the apparent failure of Israel's parochial press
corps.
On June 7, Haaretz's Anshel Pfeffer reported on an IDF press release claiming without evidence that five flotilla
passengers had links to international terror. The press release was larded with highly implausible claims, including that
Ken O'Keefe, who runs an aid organization with Tony Blair's sister-in-law, was planning to train a Hamas commando unit
in the Gaza Strip. When I called the IDF Spokesman's Office, I learned that once again, no evidence was available to
support their press release. ""There is very limited intelligence we can give in this specific case,"" Sgt. Chen Arad told me.
""Obviously I'm unable to give you more information."" Did Pfeffer demand more evidence? If he did and was answered in
the same manner as I did, why did Haaretz publish an unsubstantiated spin as fact?
Joined by Haaretz military correspondents Avi Isacharoff and Amos Harel, Pfeffer became a channel for another daytime
deception by the IDF. On May 31, the three reporters produced an article based exclusively on testimony from Naval
commandos — the flotilla passengers' side of the story was ignored — claiming they had faced live fire and lynching
attempts from Marmara passengers. Since the story was published, the IDF has produced scant evidence to support
either accusation. The article was accompanied by a suspicious photo from the IDF Spokesman's Office depicting a
bearded Muslim man brandishing a knife and surrounded by photojournalists. Daylight beamed in from a window behind
the man. Haaretz's caption, which was sourced to the IDF, asserted that the photo was taken ""after"" the commandos had
boarded the Marmara. However, the commandos raided the ship at night, while the photo was taken during the day. Once
again, the IDF's story was fishy.
I called Sgt. Arad at the IDF Spokesman's Office to investigate. He told me he had no evidence to support the photo's
questionable caption. Soon after our phone conversation, Haaretz quietly altered the caption, removing its claim that the
photo was taken ""after"" the commando raid. For nearly a week, the false photo caption had remained intact. Why did
Haaretz suddenly change it? The only plausible explanation is that the paper received a tip from the IDF Spokesman's
Office. If true, the tip-off suggests a scandalous level of coordination between the Israeli military and the country's media.
In the wake of the flotilla raid, Israeli journalists had a unique opportunity to lead the global media's investigation into the
bloodbath that occurred on the deck of the Mavi Marmara. After all, no one had better access to the military or the
eyewitnesses aboard the flotilla. Instead, too many among the Israeli press corps allowed themselves to be conscripted
into the IDF's hapless information war, leaving the important task of investigating the raid to independent reporters who
remembered to view claims by any nation's military with extreme skepticism.
So why do well-connected, experienced reporters follow the IDF baton so willingly, and fail to follow up when IDF claims
are retracted? Is it simple bias, a desire to present their military in the best possible light, a desire so strong they abandon
their duty to their readers to verify their information? Are they afraid of sanctions, of losing contacts and access to
information? Do they fear personal reprisals? Their readers, and the world media that still relies on Israeli journalism as a
vital source of information, need to know.","['Israel', 'Dvorit', 'Shargal', 'Israel', 'Israel', 'Mavi', 'Marmara', 'Marmara', 'Marmara', 'Israel', 'North', 'America', 'Mavi', 'Marmara', 'Marmara', 'Marmara', 'Auschwitz', 'Marmara', 'Israel', 'Gaza', 'Strip', 'Marmara', 'Marmara', 'Mavi', 'Marmara']"

Stanley McChrystal, Obama's top commander in Afghanistan,
has seized control of the war by never taking his eye off the
real enemy: The wimps in the White House
By Michael Hastings
Jun 22, 2010 10:00 AM EDT
This article originally appeared in RS 1108/1109 from July 8-22, 2010.
'Howed I get screwed into going to this dinner?"" demands Gen. Stanley McChrystal. It's a Thursday night in mid-April,
and the commander of all U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan is sitting in a four-star suite at the HOtel Westminster in
Paris. He's in France to sell his new war strategy to our NATO allies — to keep up the fiction, in essence, that we actually
have allies. Since McChrystal took over a year ago, the Afghan war has become the exclusive property of the United
States. Opposition to the war has already toppled the Dutch government, forced the resignation of Germany's president
and sparked both Canada and the Netherlands to announce the withdrawal of their 4,500 troops. McChrystal is in Paris to
keep the French, who have lost more than 40 soldiers in Afghanistan, from going all wobbly on him.
""The dinner comes with the position, sir,"" says his chief of staff, Col. Charlie Flynn.
McChrystal turns sharply in his chair.
""Hey, Charlie,"" he asks, ""does this come with the position?""
McChrystal gives him the middle finger.
The general stands and looks around the suite that his traveling staff of 10 has converted into a full-scale operations
center. The tables are crowded with silver Panasonic Toughbooks, and blue cables crisscross the hotel's thick carpet,
hooked up to satellite dishes to provide encrypted phone and e-mail communications. Dressed in off-the-rack civilian
casual — blue tie, button-down shirt, dress slacks — McChrystal is way out of his comfort zone. Paris, as one of his
advisers says, is the ""most anti-McChrystal city you can imagine."" The general hates fancy restaurants, rejecting any
place with candles on the tables as too ""Gucci."" He prefers Bud Light Lime (his favorite beer) to Bordeaux, Talladega
Nights (his favorite movie) to Jean-Luc Godard. Besides, the public eye has never been a place where McChrystal felt
comfortable: Before President Obama put him in charge of the war in Afghanistan, he spent five years running the
Pentagon's most secretive black ops.
""What's the update on the Kandahar bombing?"" McChrystal asks Flynn. The city has been rocked by two massive car
bombs in the past day alone, calling into question the general's assurances that he can wrest it from the Taliban.
""We have two KIAs, but that hasn't been confirmed,"" Flynn says.
McChrystal takes a final look around the suite. At 55, he is gaunt and lean, not unlike an older version of Christian Bale in
Rescue Dawn. His slate-blue eyes have the unsettling ability to drill down when they lock on you. If you've fucked up or
disappointed him, they can destroy your soul without the need for him to raise his voice.
""I'd rather have my ass kicked by a roomful of people than go out to this dinner,"" McChrystal says.
He pauses a beat.
""Unfortunately,"" he adds, ""no one in this room could do it.""
With that, he's out the door.
""Who's he going to dinner with?"" I ask one of his aides.
""Some French minister,"" the aide tells me. ""It's fucking gay.""
The next morning, McChrystal and his team gather to prepare for a speech he is giving at the Ecole Militaire, a French
military academy. The general prides himself on being sharper and ballsier than anyone else, but his brashness comes
with a price: Although McChrystal has been in charge of the war for only a year, in that short time he has managed to piss
off almost everyone with a stake in the conflict. Last fall, during the question-and-answer session following a speech he
gave in London, McChrystal dismissed the counterterrorism strategy being advocated by Vice President Joe Biden as
""shortsighted,"" saying it would lead to a state of ""Chaos-istan."" The remarks earned him a smackdown from the president
himself, who summoned the general to a terse private meeting aboard Air Force One. The message to McChrystal
seemed clear: Shut the fuck up, and keep a lower profile
Now, flipping through printout cards of his speech in Paris, McChrystal wonders aloud what Biden question he might get
today, and how he should respond. ""I never know what's going to pop out until I'm up there, that's the problem,"" he says.
Then, unable to help themselves, he and his staff imagine the general dismissing the vice president with a good one-
liner.
""Are you asking about Vice President Biden?"" McChrystal says with a laugh. ""Who's that?""
""Biden?"" suggests a top adviser. ""Did you say: Bite Me?""
When Barack Obama entered the Oval Office, he immediately set out to deliver on his most important campaign
promise on foreign policy: to refocus the war in Afghanistan on what led us to invade in the first place. ""I want the
American people to understand,"" he announced in March 2009. ""We have a clear and focused goal: to disrupt, dismantle
and defeat Al Qaeda in Pakistan and Afghanistan."" He ordered another 21,000 troops to Kabul, the largest increase since
the war began in 2001. Taking the advice of both the Pentagon and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, he also fired Gen. David
McKiernan — then the U.S. and NATO commander in Afghanistan — and replaced him with a man he didn't know and had
met only briefly: Gen. Stanley McChrystal. It was the first time a top general had been relieved from duty during wartime in
more than 50 years, since Harry Truman fired Gen. Douglas MacArthur at the height of the Korean War.
Even though he had voted for Obama, McChrystal and his new commander in chief failed from the outset to connect. The
general first encountered Obama a week after he took office, when the president met with a dozen senior military officials
in a room at the Pentagon known as the Tank. According to sources familiar with the meeting, McChrystal thought Obama
looked ""uncomfortable and intimidated"" by the roomful of military brass. Their first one-on-one meeting took place in the
Oval Office four months later, after McChrystal got the Afghanistan job, and it didn't go much better. ""It was a 10-minute
photo op,"" says an adviser to McChrystal. ""Obama clearly didn't know anything about him, who he was. Here's the guy
who's going to run his fucking war, but he didn't seem very engaged. The Boss was pretty disappointed.""
From the start, McChrystal was determined to place his personal stamp on Afghanistan, to use it as a laboratory for a
controversial military strategy known as counterinsurgency. COIN, as the theory is known, is the new gospel of the
Pentagon brass, a doctrine that attempts to square the military's preference for high-tech violence with the demands of
fighting protracted wars in failed states. COIN calls for sending huge numbers of ground troops to not only destroy the
enemy, but to live among the civilian population and slowly rebuild, or build from scratch, another nation's government — a
process that even its staunchest advocates admit requires years, if not decades, to achieve. The theory essentially
rebrands the military, expanding its authority (and its funding) to encompass the diplomatic and political sides of warfare:
Think the Green Berets as an armed Peace Corps. In 2006, after Gen. David Petraeus beta-tested the theory during his
""surge"" in Iraq, it quickly gained a hardcore following of think-tankers, journalists, military officers and civilian officials.
Nicknamed ""COINdinistas"" for their cultish zeal, this influential cadre believed the doctrine would be the perfect solution
for Afghanistan. All they needed was a general with enough charisma and political savvy to implement it.
As McChrystal leaned on Obama to ramp up the war, he did it with the same fearlessness he used to track down terrorists
in Iraq: Figure out how your enemy operates, be faster and more ruthless than everybody else, then take the fuckers out.
After arriving in Afghanistan last June, the general conducted his own policy review, ordered up by Defense Secretary
Robert Gates. The now-infamous report was leaked to the press, and its conclusion was dire: If we didn't send another
40,000 troops — swelling the number of U.S. forces in Afghanistan by nearly half — we were in danger of ""mission failure.""
The White House was furious. McChrystal, they felt, was trying to bully Obama, opening him up to charges of being weak
on national security unless he did what the general wanted. It was Obama versus the Pentagon, and the Pentagon was
determined to kick the president's ass.
Last fall, with his top general calling for more troops, Obama launched a three-month review to re-evaluate the strategy in
Afghanistan. ""I found that time painful,"" McChrystal tells me in one of several lengthy interviews. ""I was selling an
unsellable position."" For the general, it was a crash course in Beltway politics — a battle that pitted him against
experienced Washington insiders like Vice President Biden, who argued that a prolonged counterinsurgency campaign in
Afghanistan would plunge America into a military quagmire without weakening international terrorist networks. ""The entire
COIN strategy is a fraud perpetuated on the American people,"" says Douglas Macgregor, a retired colonel and leading
critic of counterinsurgency who attended West Point with McChrystal. ""The idea that we are going to spend a trillion
dollars to reshape the culture of the Islamic world is utter nonsense.
In the end, however, McChrystal got almost exactly what he wanted. On December 1st, in a speech at West Point, the
president laid out all the reasons why fighting the war in Afghanistan is a bad idea: It's expensive; we're in an economic
crisis; a decade-long commitment would sap American power; Al Qaeda has shifted its base of operations to Pakistan.
Then, without ever using the words ""victory"" or ""win,"" Obama announced that he would send an additional 30,000 troops
to Afghanistan, almost as many as McChrystal had requested. The president had thrown his weight, however hesitantly,
behind the counterinsurgency crowd.
Today, as McChrystal gears up for an offensive in southern Afghanistan, the prospects for any kind of success look bleak.
In June, the death toll for U.S. troops passed 1,000, and the number of IEDs has doubled. Spending hundreds of billions
of dollars on the fifth-poorest country on earth has failed to win over the civilian population, whose attitude toward U.S.
troops ranges from intensely wary to openly hostile. Thetiggest military operation of the year — a ferocious offensive that
began in February to retake the southern town of Marja — continues to drag on, prompting McChrystal himself to refer to it
as a ""bleeding ulcer."" In June, Afghanistan officially outpaced Vietnam as the longest war in American history — and
Obama has quietly begun to back away from the deadline he set for withdrawing U.S. troops in July of next year. The
president finds himself stuck in something even more insane than a quagmire: a quagmire he knowingly walked into, even
though it's precisely the kind of gigantic, mind-numbing, multigenerational nation-building project he explicitly said he
didn't want.
Even those who support McChrystal and his strategy of counterinsurgency know that whatever the general manages to
accomplish in Afghanistan, it's going to look more like Vietnam than Desert Storm. ""It's not going to look like a win, smell
like a win or taste like a win,"" says Maj. Gen. Bill Mayville, who serves as chief of operations for McChrystal. ""This is going
to end in an argument.""
The night after his speech in Paris, McChrystal and his staff head to Kitty O'Shea's, an Irish pub catering to tourists,
around the corner from the hotel. His wife, Annie, has joined him for a rare visit: Since the Iraq War began in 2003, she
has seen her husband less than 30 days a year. Though it is his and Annie's 33rd wedding anniversary, McChrystal has
invited his inner circle along for dinner and drinks at the ""least Gucci"" place his staff could find. His wife isn't surprised.
""He once took me to a Jack in the Box when I was dressed in formalwear,"" she says with a laugh.
The general's staff is a handpicked collection of killers, spies, geniuses, patriots, political operators and outright maniacs.
There's a former head of British Special Forces, two Navy Seals, an Afghan Special Forces commando, a lawyer, two
fighter pilots and at least two dozen combat veterans and counterinsurgency experts. They jokingly refer to themselves as
Team America, taking the name from the South Park-esque sendup of military cluelessness, and they pride themselves
on their can-do attitude and their disdain for authority. After arriving in Kabul last summer, Team America set about
changing the culture of the International Security Assistance Force, as the NATO-led mission is known. (U.S. soldiers had
taken to deriding ISAF as short for ""I Suck at Fighting"" or ""In Sandals and Flip-Flops."") McChrystal banned alcohol on
base, kicked out Burger King and other symbols of American excess, expanded the morning briefing to include thousands
of officers and refashioned the command center into a Situational Awareness Room, a free-flowing information hub
modeled after Mayor Mike Bloomberg's offices in New York. He also set a manic pace for his staff, becoming legendary
for sleeping four hours a night, running seven miles each morning, and eating one meal a day. (In the month I spend
around the general, I witness him eating only once.) It's a kind of superhuman narrative that has built up around him, a
staple in almost every media profile, as if the ability to go without sleep and food translates into the possibility of a man
single-handedly winning the war.
By midnight at Kitty O'Shea's, much of Team America is completely shitfaced. Two officers do an Irish jig mixed with steps
from a traditional Afghan wedding dance, while McChrystal's top advisers lock arms and sing a slurred song of their own
invention.""Afghanistan!"" they bellow.""Afghanistan!"" They call it their Afghanistan song.
McChrystal steps away from the circle, observing his team. ""All these men,"" he tells me. ""I'd die for them. And they'd die
for me.""
The assembled men may look and sound like a bunch of combat veterans letting off steam, but in fact this tight-knit group
represents the most powerful force shaping U.S. policy in Afghanistan. While McChrystal and his men are in indisputable
command of all military aspects of the war, there is no equivalent position on the diplomatic or political side. Instead, an
assortment of administration players compete over the Afghan portfolio: U.S. Ambassador Karl Eikenberry, Special
Representative to Afghanistan Richard Holbrooke, National Security Advisor Jim Jones and Secretary of State Hillary
Clinton, not to mention 40 or so other coalition ambassadors and a host of talking heads who try to insert themselves into
the mess, from John Kerry to John McCain. This diplomatic incoherence has effectively allowed McChrystal's team to call
the shots and hampered efforts to build a stable and credible government in Afghanistan. ""It jeopardizes the mission,""
says Stephen Biddle, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations who supports McChrystal. ""The military cannot
by itself create governance reform.""
Part of the problem is structural: The Defense Department budget exceeds $600 billion a year, while the State
Department receives only $50 billion. But part of the problem is personal: In private, Team McChrystal likes to talk shit
about many of Obama's top people on the diplomatic side. One aide calls Jim Jones, a retired four-star general and
veteran of the Cold War, a ""clown"" who remains ""stuck in 1985."" Politicians like McCain and Kerry, says another aide,
""turn up, have a meeting with Karzai, criticize him at the airport press conference, then get back for the Sunday talk
shows. Frankly, it's not very helpful."" Only Hillary Clinton receives good reviews from McChrystal's inner circle. ""Hillary
had Stan's back during the strategic review,"" says an adviser. ""She said, 'If Stan wants it, give him what he needs.'""
McChrystal reserves special skepticism for Holbrooke, the official in charge of reintegrating the Taliban. ""The Boss says
he's like a wounded animal,"" says a member of the general's team. ""Holbrooke keeps hearing rumors that he's going to
get fired, so that makes him dangerous. He's a brilliant guy, but he just comes in, pulls on a lever, whatever he can grasp
onto. But this is COIN, and you can't just have someone yanking on shit.""
At one point on his trip to Paris, McChrystal checks his BlackBerry. ""Oh, not another e-mail from Holbrooke,"" he groans. ""I
don't even want to open it."" He clicks on the message and reads the salutation out loud, then stuffs the BladkBerry back in
his pocket, not bothering to conceal his annoyance.
""Make sure you don't get any of that on your leg,"" an aide jokes, referring to the e-mail.
By far the most crucial — and strained — relationship is between McChrystal and Eikenberry, the U.S. ambassador.
According to those close to the two men, Eikenberry — a retired three-star general who served in Afghanistan in 2002 and
2005 — can't stand that his former subordinate is now calling the shots. He's also furious that McChrystal, backed by
NATO's allies, refused to put Eikenberry in the pivotal role of viceroy in Afghanistan, which would have made him the
diplomatic equivalent of the general. The job instead went to British Ambassador Mark Sedwill — a move that effectively
increased McChrystal's influence over diplomacy by shutting out a powerful rival. ""In reality, that position needs to be filled
by an American for it to have weight,"" says a U.S. official familiar with the negotiations.
The relationship was further strained in January, when a classified cable that Eikenberry wrote was leaked to The New
York Times. The cable was as scathing as it was prescient. The ambassador offered a brutal critique of McChrystal's
strategy, dismissed President Hamid Karzai as ""not an adequate strategic partner,"" and cast doubt on whether the
counterinsurgency plan would be ""sufficient"" to deal with Al Qaeda. ""We will become more deeply engaged here with no
way to extricate ourselves,"" Eikenberry warned, ""short of allowing the country to descend again into lawlessness and
chaos.""
McChrystal and his team were blindsided by the cable. ""I like Karl, I've known him for years, but they'd never said
anything like that to us before,"" says McChrystal, who adds that he felt ""betrayed"" by the leak. ""Here's one that covers his
flank for the history books. Now if we fail, they can say, 'I told you so.'""
The most striking example of McChrystal's usurpation of diplomatic policy is his handling of Karzai. It is McChrystal, not
diplomats like Eikenberry or Holbrooke, who enjoys the best relationship with the man America is relying on to lead
Afghanistan. The doctrine of counterinsurgency requires a credible government, and since Karzai is not considered
credible by his own people, McChrystal has worked hard to make him so. Over the past few months, he has accompanied
the president on more than 10 trips around the country, standing beside him at political meetings, or shuras, in Kandahar.
In February, the day before the doomed offensive in Marja, McChrystal even drove over to the president's palace to get
him to sign off on what would be the largest military operation of the year. Karzai's staff, however, insisted that the
president was sleeping off a cold and could not be disturbed. After several hours of haggling, McChrystal finally enlisted
the aid of Afghanistan's defense minister, who persuaded Karzai's people to wake the president from his nap.
This is one of the central flaws with McChrystal's counterinsurgency strategy: The need to build a credible government
puts us at the mercy of whatever tin-pot leader we've backed — a danger that Eikenberry explicitly warned about in his
cable. Even Team McChrystal privately acknowledges that Karzai is a less-than-ideal partner. ""He's been locked up in his
palace the past year,"" laments one of the general's top advisers. At times, Karzai himself has actively undermined
McChrystal's desire to put him in charge. During a recent visit to Walter Reed Army Medical Center, Karzai met three U.S.
soldiers who had been wounded in Uruzgan province. ""General,"" he called out to McChrystal, ""I didn't even know we were
fighting in Uruzgan!""
Growing up as a military brat, McChrystal exhibited the mixture of brilliance and cockiness that would follow him
throughout his career. His father fought in Korea and Vietnam, retiring as a two-star general, and his four brothers all
joined the armed services. Moving around to different bases, McChrystal took solace in baseball, a sport in which he
made no pretense of hiding his superiority: In Little League, he would call out strikes to the crowd before whipping a
fastball down the middle.
McChrystal entered West Point in 1972, when the U.S. military was close to its all-time low in popularity. His class was the
last to graduate before the academy started to admit women. The ""Prison on the Hudson,"" as it was known then, was a
potent mix of testosterone, hooliganism and reactionary patriotism. Cadets repeatedly trashed the mess hall in food fights,
and birthdays were celebrated with a tradition called ""rat fucking,"" which often left the birthday boy outside in the snow or
mud, covered in shaving cream. ""It was pretty out of control,"" says Lt. Gen. David Barno, a classmate who went on to
serve as the top commander in Afghanistan from 2003 to 2005. The class, filled with what Barno calls ""huge talent"" and
""wild-eyed teenagers with a strong sense of idealism,"" also produced Gen. Ray Odierno, the current commander of U.S.
forces in Iraq.
The son of a general, McChrystal was also a ringleader of the campus dissidents — a dual role that taught him how to
thrive in a rigid, top-down environment while thumbing his nose at authority every chance he got. He accumulated more
than 100 hours of demerits for drinking, partying and insubordination — a record that his classmates boasted made him a
""century man."" One classmate, who asked not to be named, recalls finding McChrystal passed out in the shower after
downing a case of beer he had hidden under the sink. The troublemaking almost got him kicked out, and he spent hours
subjected to forced marches in the Area, a paved courtyard where unruly cadets were disciplined. ""I'd come visit, and I'd
end up spending most of my time in the library, while Stan was in the Area,"" recalls Annie, who began dating McChrystal
in 1973.
McChrystal wound up ranking 298 out of a class of 855, a serious underachievement for a man widely regarded as
brilliant. His most compelling work was extracurricular: As managing editor of The Pointer, the West Point literary
magazine, McChrystal wrote seven short stories that eerily foreshadow many of the issues he would confront in his
career. In one tale, a fictional officer complains about the difficulty of training foreign troops to fight; in another, a 19-year-
old soldier kills a boy he mistakes for a terrorist. In ""Brinkman's Note,"" a piece of suspense fiction, the unnamed narrator
appears to be trying to stop a plot to assassinate the president. It turns out, however, that the narrator himself is the
assassin, and he's able to infiltrate the White House: ""The President strode in smiling. From the right coat pocket of the
raincoat I carried, I slowly drew forth my 32-caliber pistol. In Brinkman's failure, I had succeeded.""
After graduation, 2nd Lt. Stanley McChrystal entered an Army that was all but broken in the wake of Vietnam. ""We really
felt we were a peacetime generation,"" he recalls. ""There was the Gulf War, but even that didn't feel like that big of a deal.""
So McChrystal spent his career where the action was: He enrolled in Special Forces school and became a regimental
commander of the 3rd Ranger Battalion in 1986. It was a dangerous position, even in peacetime — nearly two dozen
Rangers were killed in training accidents during the Eighties. It was also an unorthodox career path: Most soldiers who
want to climb the ranks to general don't go into the Rangers. Displaying a penchant for transforming systems he considers
outdated, McChrystal set out to revolutionize the training regime for the Rangers. He introduced mixed martial arts,
required every soldier to qualify with night-vision goggles on the rifle range and forced troops to build up their endurance
with weekly marches involving heavy backpacks.
In the late 1990s, McChrystal shrewdly improved his inside game, spending a year at Harvard's Kennedy School of
Government and then at the Council on Foreign Relations, where he co-authored a treatise on the merits and drawbacks
of humanitarian interventionism. But as he moved up through the ranks, McChrystal relied on the skills he had learned as
a troublemaking kid at West Point: knowing precisely how far he could go in a rigid military hierarchy without getting
tossed out. Being a highly intelligent badass, he discovered, could take you far — especially in the political chaos that
followed September 11th. ""He was very focused,"" says Annie. ""Even as a young officer he seemed to know what he
wanted to do. I don't think his personality has changed in all these years.""
By some accounts, McChrystal's career should have been over at least two times by now. As Pentagon spokesman
during the invasion of Iraq, the general seemed more like a White House mouthpiece than an up-and-coming commander
with a reputation for speaking his mind. When Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld made his infamous ""stuff happens""
remark during the looting of Baghdad, McChrystal backed him up. A few days later, he echoed the president's Mission
Accomplished gaffe by insisting that major combat operations in Iraq were over. But it was during his next stint —
overseeing the military's most elite units, including the Rangers, Navy Seals and Delta Force — that McChrystal took part
in a cover-up that would have destroyed the career of a lesser man.
After Cpl. Pat Tillman, the former-NFL-star-turned-Ranger, was accidentally killed by his own troops in Afghanistan in April
2004, McChrystal took an active role in creating the impression that Tillman had died at the hands of Taliban fighters. He
signed off on a falsified recommendation for a Silver Star that suggested Tillman had been killed by enemy fire.
(McChrystal would later claim he didn't read the recommendation closely enough — a strange excuse for a commander
known for his laserlike attention to minute details.) A week later, McChrystal sent a memo up the chain of command,
specifically warning that President Bush should avoid mentioning the cause of Tillman's death. ""If the circumstances of
Corporal Tillman's death become public,"" he wrote, it could cause ""public embarrassment"" for the president.
""The false narrative, which McChrystal clearly helped construct, diminished Pat's true actions,"" wrote Tillman's mother,
Mary, in her book Boots on the Ground by Dusk. McChrystal got away with it, she added, because he was the ""golden
boy"" of Rumsfeld and Bush, who loved his willingness to get things done, even if it included bending the rules or skipping
the chain of command. Nine days after Tillman's death, McChrystal was promoted to major general.
Two years later, in 2006, McChrystal was tainted by a scandal involving detainee abuse and torture at Camp Nama in
Iraq. According to a report by Human Rights Watch, prisoners at the camp were subjected to a now-familiar litany of
abuse: stress positions, being dragged naked through the mud. McChrystal was not disciplined in the scandal, even
though an interrogator at the camp reported seeing him inspect the prison multiple times. But the experience was so
unsettling to McChrystal that he tried to prevent detainee operations from being placed under his command in
Afghanistan, viewing them as a ""political swamp,"" according to a U.S. official. In May 2009, as McChrystal prepared for
his confirmation hearings, his staff prepared him for hard questions about Camp Nama and the Tillman cover-up. But the
scandals barely made a ripple in Congress, and McChrystal was soon on his way back to Kabul to run the war in
Afghanistan.
The media, to a large extent, have also given McChrystal a pass on both controversies. Where Gen. Petraeus is kind of a
dweeb, a teacher's pet with a Ranger's tab, McChrystal is a snake-eating rebel, a ""Jedi"" commander, as Newsweek called
him. He didn't care when his teenage son came home with blue hair and a mohawk. He speaks his mind with a candor
rare for a high-ranking official. He asks for opinions, and seems genuinely interested in the response. He gets briefings on
his iPod and listens to books on tape. He carries a custom-made set of nunchucks in his convoy engraved with his name
and four stars, and his itinerary often bears a fresh quote from Bruce Lee. (""There are no limits. There are only plateaus,
and you must not stay there, you must go beyond them."") He went out on dozens of nighttime raids during his time in Iraq,
unprecedented for a top commander, and turned up on missions unannounced, with almost no entourage. ""The fucking
lads love Stan McChrystal,"" says a British officer who serves in Kabul. ""You'd be out in Somewhere, Iraq, and someone
would take a knee beside you, and a corporal would be like 'Who the fuck is that?' And it's fucking Stan McChrystal.""
It doesn't hurt that McChrystal was also extremely successful as head of the Joint Special Operations Command, the elite
forces that carry out the government's darkest ops. During the Iraq surge, his team killed and captured thousands of
insurgents, including Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the leader of Al Qaeda in Iraq. ""JSOC was a killing machine,"" says Maj. Gen.
Mayville, his chief of operations. McChrystal was also open to new ways of killing. He systematically mapped out terrorist
networks, targeting specific insurgents and hunting them down — often with the help of cyberfreaks traditionally shunned
by the military. ""The Boss would find the 24-year-old kid with a nose ring, with some fucking brilliant degree from MIT,
sitting in the corner with 16 computer monitors humming,"" says a Special Forces commando who worked with McChrystal
in Iraq and now serves on his staff in Kabul. ""He'd say, 'Hey — you fucking muscleheads couldn't find lunch without help.
You got to work together with these guys.'""
Even in his new role as America's leading evangelist for counterinsurgency, McChrystal retains the deep-seated instincts
of a terrorist hunter. To put pressure on the Taliban, he has upped the number of Special Forces units in Afghanistan from
four to 19. ""You better be out there hitting four or five targets tonight,"" McChrystal will tell a Navy Seal he sees in the
hallway at headquarters. Then he'll add, ""I'm going to have to scold you in the morning for it, though."" In fact, the general
frequently finds himself apologizing for the disastrous consequences of counterinsurgency. In the first four months of this
year, NATO forces killed some 90 civilians, up 76 percent from the same period in 2009 — a record that has created
tremendous resentment among the very population that COIN theory is intent on winning over. In February, a Special
Forces night raid ended in the deaths of two pregnant Afghan women and allegations of a cover-up, and in April, protests
erupted in Kandahar after U.S. forces accidentally shot up a bus, killing five Afghans. ""We've shot an amazing number of
people,"" McChrystal recently conceded.
Despite the tragedies and miscues, McChrystal has issued some of the strictest directives to avoid civilian casualties that
the U.S. military has ever encountered in a war zone. It's ""insurgent math,"" as he calls it — for every innocent person you
kill, you create 10 new enemies. He has ordered convoys to curtail their reckless driving, put restrictions on the use of air
power and severely limited night raids. He regularly apologizes to Hamid Karzai when civilians are killed, and berates
commanders responsible for civilian deaths. ""For a while,"" says one U.S. official, ""the most dangerous place to be in
Afghanistan was in front of McChrystal after a 'civ cas' incident."" The ISAF command has even discussed ways to make
not killing into something you can win an award for: There's talk of creating a new medal for ""courageous restraint,"" a
buzzword that's unlikely to gain much traction in the gung-ho culture of the U.S. military.
But however strategic they may be, McChrystal's new marching orders have caused an intense backlash among his own
troops. Being told to hold their fire, soldiers complain, puts them in greater danger. ""Bottom line?"" says a former Special
Forces operator who has spent years in Iraq and Afghanistan. ""I would love to kick McChrystal in the nuts. His rules of
engagement put soldiers' lives in even greater danger. Every real soldier will tell you the same thing.""
In March, McChrystal traveled to Combat Outpost JFM — a small encampment on the outskirts of Kandahar — to confront
such accusations from the troops directly. It was a typically bold move by the general. Only two days earlier, he had
received an e-mail from Israel Arroyo, a 25-year-old staff sergeant who asked McChrystal to go on a mission with his unit.
""I am writing because it was said you don't care about the troops and have made it harder to defend ourselves,"" Arroyo
wrote.
Within hours, McChrystal responded personally: ""I'm saddened by the accusation that I don't care about soldiers, as it is
something I suspect any soldier takes both personally and professionally — at least I do. But I know perceptions depend
upon your perspective at the time, and I respect that every soldier's view is his own."" Then he showed up at Arroyo's
outpost and went on a foot patrol with the troops — not some bullshit photo-op stroll through a market, but a real live
operation in a dangerous war zone.
Six weeks later, just before McChrystal returned from Paris, the general received another e-mail from Arroyo. A 23-year-
old corporal named Michael Ingram — one of the soldiers McChrystal had gone on patrol with — had been killed by an IED
a day earlier. It was the third man the 25-member platoon had lost in a year, and Arroyo was writing to see if the general
would attend Ingram's memorial service. ""He started to look up to you,"" Arroyo wrote. McChrystal said he would try to
make it down to pay his respects as soon as possible.
The night before the general is scheduled to visit Sgt. Arroyo's platoon for the memorial, I arrive at Combat Outpost JFM
to speak with the soldiers he had gone on patrol with. JFM is a small encampment, ringed by high blast walls and guard
towers. Almost all of the soldiers here have been on repeated combat tours in both Iraq and Afghanistan, and have seen
some of the worst fighting of both wars. But they are especially angered by Ingram's death. His commanders had
repeatedly requested permission to tear down the house where Ingram was killed, noting that it was often used as a
combat position by the Taliban. But due to McChrystal's new restrictions to avoid upsetting civilians, the request had been
denied. ""These were abandoned houses,"" fumes Staff Sgt. Kennith Hicks. ""Nobody was coming back to live in them.""
One soldier shows me the list of new regulations the platoon was given. ""Patrol only in areas that you are reasonably
certain that you will not have to defend yourselves with lethal force,"" the laminated card reads. For a soldier who has
traveled halfway around the world to fight, that's like telling a cop he should only patrol in areas where he knows he won't
have to make arrests. ""Does that make any fucking sense?"" asks Pfc. Jared Pautsch. ""We should just drop a fucking
bomb on this place. You sit and ask yourself: What are we doing here?""
The rules handed out here are not what McChrystal intended — they've been distorted as they passed through the chain of
command — but knowing that does nothing to lessen the anger of troops on the ground. ""Fuck, when I came over here and
heard that McChrystal was in charge, I thought we would get our fucking gun on,"" says Hicks, who has served three tours
of combat. ""I get COIN. I get all that. McChrystal comes here, explains it, it makes sense. But then he goes away on his
bird, and by the time his directives get passed down to us through Big Army, they're all fucked up — either because
somebody is trying to cover their ass, or because they just don't understand it themselves. But we're fucking losing this
thing.""
McChrystal and his team show up the next day. Underneath a tent, the general has a 45-minute discussion with some two
dozen soldiers. The atmosphere is tense. ""I ask you what's going on in your world, and I think it's important for you all to
understand the big picture as well,"" McChrystal begins. ""How's the company doing? You guys feeling sorry for
yourselves? Anybody? Anybody feel like you're losing?"" McChrystal says.
""Sir, some of the guys here, sir, think we're losing, sir,"" says Hicks.
McChrystal nods. ""Strength is leading when you just don't want to lead,"" he tells the men. ""You're leading by example.
That's what we do. Particularly when it's really, really hard, and it hurts inside."" Then he spends 20 minutes talking about
counterinsurgency, diagramming his concepts and principles on a whiteboard. He makes COIN seem like common sense,
but he's careful not to bullshit the men. ""We are knee-deep in the decisive year,"" he tells them. The Taliban, he insists, no
longer has the initiative — ""but I don't think we do, either."" It's similar to the talk he gave in Paris, but it's not winning any
hearts and minds among the soldiers. ""This is the philosophical part that works with think tanks,"" McChrystal tries to joke.
""But it doesn't get the same reception from infantry companies.""
During the question-and-answer period, the frustration boils over. The soldiers complain about not being allowed to use
lethal force, about watching insurgents they detain be freed for lack of evidence. They want to be able to fight — like they
did in Iraq, like they had in Afghanistan before McChrystal. 'We aren't putting fear into the Taliban,"" one soldier says.
""Winning hearts and minds in COIN is a coldblooded thing,"" McChrystal says, citing an oft-repeated maxim that you can't
kill your way out of Afghanistan. ""The Russians killed 1 million Afghans, and that didn't work.""
""I'm not saying go out and kill everybody, sir,"" the soldier persists. ""You say we've stopped the momentum of the
insurgency. I don't believe that's true in this area. The more we pull back, the more we restrain ourselves, the stronger it's
getting.""
""I agree with you,"" McChrystal says. ""In this area, we've not made progress, probably. You have to show strength here,
you have to use fire. What I'm telling you is, fire costs you. What do you want to do? You want to wipe the population out
here and resettle it?""
A soldier complains that under the rules, any insurgent who doesn't have a weapon is immediately assumed to be a
civilian. ""That's the way this game is,"" McChrystal says. ""It's complex. I can't just decide: It's shirts and skins, and we'll kill
all the shirts.""
As the discussion ends, McChrystal seems to sense that he hasn't succeeded at easing the men's anger. He makes one
last-ditch effort to reach them, acknowledging the death of Cpl. Ingram. ""There's no way I can make that easier,"" he tells
them. ""No way I can pretend it won't hurt. No way I can tell you not to feel that. . . . I will tell you, you're doing a great job.
Don't let the frustration get to you."" The session ends with no clapping, and no real resolution. McChrystal may have sold
President Obama on counterinsurgency, but many of his own men aren't buying it.
When it comes to Afghanistan, history is not on McChrystal's side. The only foreign invader to have any success here
was Genghis Khan — and he wasn't hampered by things like human rights, economic development and press scrutiny.
The COIN doctrine, bizarrely, draws inspiration from some of the biggest Western military embarrassments in recent
memory: France's nasty war in Algeria (lost in 1962) and the American misadventure in Vietnam (lost in 1975).
McChrystal, like other advocates of COIN, readily acknowledges that counterinsurgency campaigns are inherently messy,
expensive and easy to lose. ""Even Afghans are confused by Afghanistan,"" he says. But even if he somehow manages to
succeed, after years of bloody fighting with Afghan kids who pose no threat to the U.S. homeland, the war will do little to
shut down Al Qaeda, which has shifted its operations to Pakistan. Dispatching 150,000 troops to build new schools,
roads, mosques and water-treatment facilities around Kandahar is like trying to stop the drug war in Mexico by occupying
Arkansas and building Baptist churches in Little Rock. ""It's all very cynical, politically,"" says Marc Sageman, a former CIA
case officer who has extensive experience in the region. ""Afghanistan is not in our vital interest — there's nothing for us
there.""
In mid-May, two weeks after visiting the troops in Kandahar, McChrystal travels to the White House for a high-level visit by
Hamid Karzai. It is a triumphant moment for the general, one that demonstrates he is very much in command — both in
Kabul and in Washington. In the East Room, which is packed with journalists and dignitaries, President Obama sings the
praises of Karzai. The two leaders talk about how great their relationship is, about the pain they feel over civilian
casualties. They mention the word ""progress"" 16 times in under an hour. But there is no mention of victory. Still, the •
session represents the most forceful commitment that Obama has made to McChrystal's strategy in months. ""There is no
denying the progress that the Afghan people have made in recent years — in education, in health care and economic
development,"" the president says. ""As I saw in the lights across Kabul when I landed — lights that would not have been
visible just a few years earlier.""
It is a disconcerting observation for Obama to make. During the worst years in Iraq, when the Bush administration had no
real progress to point to, officials used to offer up the exact same evidence of success. ""It was one of our first
impressions,"" one GOP official said in 2006, after landing in Baghdad at the height of the sectarian violence. ""So many
lights shining brightly."" So it is to the language of the Iraq War that the Obama administration has turned — talk of
progress, of city lights, of metrics like health care and education. Rhetoric that just a few years ago they would have
mocked. ""They are trying to manipulate perceptions because there is no definition of victory — because victory is not even
defined or recognizable,"" says Celeste Ward, a senior defense analyst at the RAND Corporation who served as a political
adviser to U.S. commanders in Iraq in 2006. ""That's the game we're in right now. What we need, for strategic purposes, is
to create the perception that we didn't get run off. The facts on the ground are not great, and are not going to become
great in the near future.""
But facts on the ground, as history has proven, offer little deterrent to a military determined to stay the course. Even those
closest to McChrystal know that the rising anti-war sentiment at home doesn't begin to reflect how deeply fucked up things
are in Afghanistan. ""If Americans pulled back and started paying attention to this war, it would become even less popular,""
a senior adviser to McChrystal says. Such realism, however, doesn't prevent advocates of counterinsurgency from
dreaming big: Instead of beginning to withdraw troops next year, as Obama promised, the military hopes to ramp up its
counterinsurgency campaign even further. ""There's a possibility we could ask for another surge of U.S. forces next
summer if we see success here,"" a senior military official in Kabul tells me.
Back in Afghanistan, less than a month after the White House meeting with Karzai and all the talk of ""progress,""
McChrystal is hit by the biggest blow to his vision of counterinsurgency. Since last year, the Pentagon had been planning
to launch a major military operation this summer in Kandahar, the country's second-largest city and the Taliban's original
home base. It was supposed to be a decisive turning point in the war — the primary reason for the troop surge that
McChrystal wrested from Obama late last year. But on June 10th, acknowledging that the military still needs to lay more
groundwork, the general announced that he is postponing the offensive until the fall. Rather than one big battle, like
Fallujah or Ramadi, U.S. troops will implement what McChrystal calls a ""rising tide of security."" The Afghan police and
army will enter Kandahar to attempt to seize control of neighborhoods, while the U.S. pours $90 million of aid into the city
to win over the civilian population.
Even proponents of counterinsurgency are hard-pressed to explain the new plan. ""This isn't a classic operation,"" says a
U.S. military official. ""It's not going to be Black Hawk Down. There aren't going to be doors kicked in."" Other U.S. officials
insist that doors are going to be kicked in, but that it's going to be a kinder, gentler offensive than the disaster in Marja.
""The Taliban have a jackboot on the city,"" says a military official. ""We have to remove them, but we have to do it in a way
that doesn't alienate the population."" When Vice President Biden was briefed on the new plan in the Oval Office, insiders
say he was shocked to see how much it mirrored the more gradual plan of counterterrorism that he advocated last fall.
""This looks like CT-plus!"" he said, according to U.S. officials familiar with the meeting.
Whatever the nature of the new plan, the delay underscores the fundamental flaws of counterinsurgency. After nine years
of war, the Taliban simply remains too strongly entrenched for the U.S. military to openly attack. The very people that
COIN seeks to win over — the Afghan people — do not want us there. Our supposed ally, President Karzai, used his
influence to delay the offensive, and the massive influx of aid championed by McChrystal is likely only to make things
worse. ""Throwing money at the problem exacerbates the problem,"" says Andrew Wilder, an expert at Tufts University who
has studied the effect of aid in southern Afghanistan. ""A tsunami of cash fuels corruption, delegitimizes the government
and creates an environment where we're picking winners and losers"" — a process that fuels resentment and hostility
among the civilian population. So far, counterinsurgency has succeeded only in creating a never-ending demand for the
primary product supplied by the military: perpetual war. There is a reason that President Obama studiously avoids using
the word ""victory"" when he talks about Afghanistan. Winning, it would seem, is not really possible. Not even with
Stanley McChrystal in charge.

Bill Clinton to U.S. soccer team: ""You are amazing!""
By Joe Conason
•
AP/Michael Sohn
Former President Bill Clinton at the World Cup group C soccer match between the United States and Algeria in Pretoria,
South Africa on Wednesday
Salon's Joe Conason is traveling with Bill Clinton in Africa this week and was with the former president at today's U.S.
World Cup soccer game in Pretoria. He filed this report:
Minutes after Landon Donovan scored the stunning extra-time goal that won a critical World Cup match against Algeria,
Bill Clinton and several of his aides and friends (including former Democratic National Committee Chairman Terry
McAuliffe) were escorted downstairs to the U.S. team's locker room. The American players roared with pride as the former
president (and honorary chairman of the committee bidding to bring the World Cup to the U.S. in 2018 or 2022) walked in.
After a round of embraces, handshakes and high fives, he spoke briefly about his joy in their victory: ""I'm proud of you
because you didn't let the frustration of all the shots that you almost made get you down. You are amazing!""
Much posing for pictures ensued with the shirtless, whooping, chest-bumping players -- who couldn't quite seem to
believe they had done it.
The team then invited Clinton alone to join them in the inner locker room, where he could be glimpsed toasting them with
a beer amid much additional hollering. When he emerged 10 minutes or so later, he had a broad smile and a hoarse
voice.
As Clinton left for Johannesburg, where he will meet tomorrow with former President Nelson Mandela, one of the players
chased him out into the hall and handed one of the former president's aides an official ball signed by all the members of
Team USA.
Clinton stopped for just a moment to talk with the local press before disappearing in a convoy of flashing lights and sirens.
""If it hadn't been the decisive game, even I would have said it should have been a tie,"" he said. ""It was a great game. You
know, all great contests become head games at some point -- sports, elections, wars. And they [Team USA] have good
heads and good hearts.""","['U.S.', 'United', 'States', 'Algeria', 'Pretoria', 'South', 'Africa', 'Africa', 'U.S.', 'Pretoria', 'Algeria', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'Johannesburg', 'Team', 'USA']"

ANALYSIS
For us, there is merit",[]
5355,"An interview with George YeoSee hus analysis of where we are on EAS but also on the US, Japan, and Chinese urbanization and trade patterns..
Nothing that new, but valuable coming from him.
The Australian - 19 Jun 10
Embracing everyone from the US to India Greg Sheridan, Foreign editor
GEORGE Yeo, Singapore's Foreign Minister, is one of the most dazzlingly clever people you could meet in Southeast
Asia. Singapore is a society that notoriously produces hardheads in its strategic outlook. But Yeo combines Singapore's
characteristic hard-headedness with a depth of historical understanding and context, as well as a lively human sympathy
for the diversity of the region that surrounds him, which I, at any event, find almost unique. I remember interviewing
him at the height of the East Asian economic crisis in 1997 and asking whether this crisis shattered the idea of Asia as
the growing centre of the global economy, as numerous foolishly triumphalist Western commentators were then
suggesting. ""No it doesn't,"" Yeo told me. ""At the most it might put back the forecasts by five or 10 years."" It moved the
graph a little to the right, it didn't change the trends. On that, Yeo was absolutely right.
But it is also Yeo's ability to apply the insights of history to the real problems of Asia today which make him formidable.
This week, Yeo spent a few days in Australia and I caught up with him for one of those slightly mesmerising historical
tour de force conversations in which he specialises.
It is no secret Singapore had the most serious reservations about Kevin Rudd's proposal to establish an Asia-Pacific
Community. The Prime Minister wanted the US, India and Russia included in a regional body which could deal with
strategic issues as well as trade and economics. Singapore's hesitation over the Rudd proposal came because it thought
that the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, of which it is a key member, could be sidelined. I asked Yeo whether the
region was now clear on what it wanted its organisations to accomplish. ""We still need a lot more discussion,"" he said.
""The vision is going to change dramatically, with the emergence of China and India on the global stage. The
configuration is evolving much faster than most of us would have preferred. But that's the reality we've got to work
with.
We need a regional architecture which is able to accommodate the stresses. The single most important relationship is
between the US and China. Increasingly, the relationship between India and China is becoming more important. I think
eventually a triangular relationship will decide the big issues of war and peace in Asia this century - the triangle
consisting of the US, China and India.""
Yeo saw Rudd and Foreign Minister Stephen Smith in Canberra and now describes Canberra and Singapore as being in
harmony on the evolution of regional organisations. This is how he saw it having played out: ""When Prime Minister Rudd
proposed the APC, Dick Woolcott (Rudd's envoy) went round the region. He did not visit all countries. He made it quite
plain to some that only the big countries of ASEAN need to be involved. We talked among ourselves and quite soon the
conclusion was reached that ASEAN was going to be sidelined. So there was an immediate blowback from the region.
""To PM Rudd's credit he quickly clarified this, that ASEAN is central to his conception of the APC and that that was his
vision from the very beginning. I said, 'All of us in the region are very relieved to hear that'.
""Separately we had (former Japanese) prime minister (Yukio) Hatoyama articulating his view of an East Asian region
apparently centred on China, Japan and Korea. It created, as you would expect, a natural reaction in Southeast Asia. That
got us all thinking in the region. How to keep Russia and the US in the region in a way that's comfortable. For a long time
we've been thinking about China, more recently about India."" Yeo pointed out that earlier regional organisations also
evolved slowly, in particular the East Asia Summit, which includes Australia and New Zealand, as well as ASEAN, China,
Japan, South Korea and India. He said: ""It took us a long time to create the EAS structure. Some preferred it to be based
on the ASEAN plus three (China, Japan, Korea), harking back to (former Malaysian prime minister) Mahathir
(Mohamad)'s East Asian caucus. ""Others felt that's too limiting. If it's just ASEAN plus three, that may be a little lop-sided
because of the economic weight of the plus three. So we thought if we have India on one side, and Australia and New
Zealand to the south, there's a certain natural equipoise.
""Then it took many discussions. The Russians wanted to join the EAS but we felt this should not be rushed. Russia is too
important a country. There was some unhappiness from the Russians that we did not accommodate them in the EAS at
that time. (Former US) President (George W.) Bush did not want to join the EAS but he worried that the EAS might
exclude the US from the region. We told our American friends that it could not be purely an Asian thing because
Australia and New Zealand were in it. In any case, countries like Singapore would never want an EAS to be exclusive.
What would threaten us most is if the world developed into blocs.""
So where do we end up today? ""When I met PM Rudd I thanked him for helping to catalyse the thinking of ASEAN. So
now there are two possibilities, either an EAS expanded for Russia and the US or a separate ASEAN plus eight (including
the US and Russia) configuration. In fact I had a very interesting discussion with Prime Minister Rudd. I think in the end
he's happy to let ASEAN members decide and he doesn't want to interfere in our regional discussion.""
So you can describe what Yeo outlines as either a win or a loss for Rudd. Whatever evolves, nobody is going to call it the
Asia-Pacific Community and no one is going to imagine that Rudd was its founder, as everyone accepts that Bob Hawke
founded APEC in 1989. On the other hand, it does seem as though it's very much more than likely that there will finally
be a regional organisation embracing everyone from the US to India, which is able to discuss security. That is pretty
much Rudd's policy aim and, as Yeo constructively puts it, Rudd has influenced ASEAN thinking. Friends of Rudd can
describe it as the embodiment of his vision and fulfilment of his initiative. His enemies can say the APC came to nothing
and was a failure in Australian diplomacy. Certainly Yeo casts it in a constructive light. There is only space to give the
smallest sampling of Yeo's prodigiously rich insights on other issues.
On the US, he said: ""Both Australia and Singapore feel it in our bones that the US will remain a great power for many
decades. It is a vast country always throwing up new ideas, always on the boil. It has a sunny disposition. We in
Singapore and Australia feel it in our bones that one way or another they will get out of their current difficulties.""
On China, I asked whether its political development was keeping pace with its growth in power, financial and military, so
it could manage that new power in a way that was beneficial to everybody. Yeo stressed that he was sure Beijing's
preoccupations were internal, and said: ""China is the No 1 trading partner for Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, India
and already No 2 for New Zealand, and for all the countries (in Asia) the graph points in the same direction.""
(The historical process) is high drama in China. It was historically because of the large rural peasantry that Maoism
developed as a different ideology from Bolshevism. China was 20 per cent urban. It's now 40 per cent urban and will go
to 80 per cent or 90 per cent. The urbanisation of Europe was languid by comparison, but look at Dickens or Victor Hugo.
Look at the huge reaction in Europe to urbanisation and industrialisation. In China it's all compressed. If they succeed
they will be the greatest nation on Earth. The Chinese know they have to learn new tricks. The skills which brought them
to power won't keep them in power.""
He recalled that early in China's economic modernisation program it was fascinated by how Singapore, as a mostly
Chinese nation, ran its society in such an orderly and effective manner, combining rapid economic growth with social
order and a respect for tradition. Then that interest seemed to wane. But now Chinese delegations are back again in
large numbers, fascinated particularly with how Singapore manages the politics of being a big and booming
city. Mainland Chinese are even sitting in on politicians' electoral clinics in Singapore, observing how real problems are
recognised, integrated into the system and dealt with.
I asked Yeo too whether he thought Japan could sustain the stabilising role it has played in Asia these past 60 years. He
replied: ""Their politics now are a mess. Partly because they fit the pieces together so closely, reconfiguring the pieces is-
difficult. A lot of Japanese politics now is not about fitting the pieces together but pulling them apart.
""The DP1 came to power determined to pull the pieces apart, the Liberal Democratic Party from big business from the
bureacracy. Never write Japan off. It takes a long time for them to change but when they do change they do it with a
fury and intensity that surprises everyone."" Japan has gone through profound periods of change in the past - the Meiji
Restoration of the 19th century, in which it decided to become a modern nation; or the pervasive change after World
War II, in which it decided to embrace democracy and the role of the key US ally in the region. The fact that it is now
grappling with change is no reason to think it cannot emerge again with a successful model.
Yeo is an old, old friend of Australia, and in a sense a long-term champion of Australia's involvement in Southeast Asia.
He has been a minister in the Singapore government for more than 20 years. He embodies a great deal of institutional
memory and strategic continuity, not just within Singapore but within the broader councils of the region.
It's just a pity he doesn't visit us a bit more often.","['US', 'Japan', 'US', 'India', 'Singapore', 'Southeast', 'Asia', 'Singapore', 'Asia', 'Asia', 'Australia', 'Singapore', 'US', 'India', 'Russia', 'Singapore', 'China', 'India', 'US', 'China', 'India', 'China', 'Asia', 'US', 'China', 'India', 'Canberra', 'Canberra', 'Singapore', 'China', 'Japan', 'Korea', 'Southeast', 'Asia', 'Russia', 'US', 'China', 'India', 'East', 'Asia', 'Summit', 'Australia', 'New', 'Zealand', 'China', 'Japan', 'South', 'Korea', 'India', 'China', 'Japan', 'Korea', 'India', 'Australia', 'New', 'Zealand', 'Russia', 'US', 'US', 'Australia', 'New', 'Zealand', 'Singapore', 'Russia', 'US', 'US', 'Russia', 'Asia-Pacific', 'US', 'India', 'US', 'Australia', 'Singapore', 'US', 'Singapore', 'Australia', 'China', 'China', 'Japan', 'Korea', 'Taiwan', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'India', 'New', 'Zealand', 'Asia', 'China', 'China', 'Europe', 'Europe', 'China', 'Earth', 'China', 'Singapore', 'Singapore', 'Singapore', 'Japan', 'Asia', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'US', 'Australia', 'Australia', 'Southeast', 'Asia', 'Singapore', 'Singapore']"

Chairwoman Announces Oversight Hearings on Corruption in Afghanistan
WASHINGTON — In light of two troubling news reports on corruption within the Afghan government, Congresswoman
Nita Lowey (D-NY), Chairwoman of the Appropriations State and Foreign Operations Subcommittee, today announced
she is removing funding for Afghanistan beyond humanitarian aid from her 2011 bill scheduled for markup this week.
""The alleged shipment of billions in donor funds out of Afghanistan and allegations of Afghan government insiders
impeding corruption investigations are outrageous,"" said Lowey. ""I do not intend to appropriate one more dime for
assistance to Afghanistan until I have confidence that U.S. taxpayer money is not being abused to line the pockets of
corrupt Afghan government officials, drug lords, and terrorists. Furthermore, the government of Afghanistan must
demonstrate that corruption is being aggressively investigated and prosecuted.
""Rampant corruption fosters the conditions that threaten the security of our troops and the stability of the Afghan
government and economy.""
The State and Foreign Operations Appropriations Subcommittee will mark up its Fiscal Year 2011 Appropriations Act on
Wednesday June 30th. The subcommittee will not consider any bilateral assistance for the Afghan government other
than lifesaving humanitarian aid at this time.
Lowey also announced the Subcommittee will hold oversight hearings after the July 4th recess to get to the bottom of
these allegations.
""Too many Americans are suffering in this economy for us to put their hard-earned tax dollars into the hands of
criminals overseas,"" said Lowey. ""We will not commit billions more in taxpayer money for Afghanistan until there are
assurances that such funds will be used for their intended purposes and that the government of Afghanistan is willing
and able to root corruption within its ranks. U.S. taxpayers deserve nothing less.""","['Afghanistan', 'WASHINGTON', 'Afghanistan', 'Afghanistan', 'Afghanistan', 'U.S.', 'Afghanistan', 'Afghanistan', 'Afghanistan', 'U.S.']"

The political ramifications of the Greek/European debt crisis
As you know, the EU-IMF-USG consensus hope motivating the Greek bailout is that it will buy time for Spain, Portugal,
etc. From widening credit spreads to falling stock prices, most relevant market indicators are responding with doubt.
Former IMF Chief Economist and NYT Columnist (and influential blogger for bond traders) Simon Johnson has an
important rejoinder to this consensus hope in today's NYT, full text pasted below.
As the EU has no playbook for most of the pressing questions it faces, my staff is working to
brainstorm as to the least bad of what are only sobering options.
This is long but worth it.
May 6, 2010, 6:11 amIt's Not About Greece AnymoreBy PETER BOONE AND SIMON JOHNSONLouisa Gouliamaki/Agence
France-Presse — Getty Images Protesters waved flags from the Acropolis archaeological site behind banners in English
and Greek hung in front of the Parthenon temple in Athens.Peter Boone is chairman of the charity Effective Intervention
and a research associate at the Center for Economic Performance at the London School of Economics. He is also a
principal in Salute Capital Management Ltd. Simon Johnson, the former chief economist at the International Monetary
Fund, is the co-author of ""13 Bankers.""The Greek ""rescue"" package announced last weekend is dramatic, unprecedented
and far from enough to stabilize the euro zone.The Greek government and the European Union leadership, prodded by
the International Monetary Fund, are finally becoming realistic about the dire economic situation in Greece. They have
abandoned previous rounds of optimistic forecasts and have now admitted to a profoundly worse situation. This new
program calls for ""fiscal adjustments"" — cuts to the fiscal deficit, mostly through spending cuts — totaling 11 percent of
gross domestic product in 2010, 4.3 percent in 2011, and 2 percent in 2012 and 2013. The total debt-to-G.D.P. ratio
peaks at 149 percent in 2012-13 before starting a gentle glide path back down to sanity.This new program is honest
enough to show why it is unlikely to succeed.Daniel Gros, an eminent economist on euro zone issues based in Brussels,
has argued that for each 1 percent of G.D.P. decline in Greek government spending, total demand in the country falls by
2.5 percent of G.D.P. If the government reduces spending by 15 percent of G.D.P. — the initial shock to demand could
be well over 30 percent of G.D.P.Obviously this simple rule does not work with such large numbers, but it illustrates that
Greece is likely to experience a very sharp recession — and there is substantial uncertainty around how bad the
economy will get. The program announced last weekend assumes Greek G.D.P. falls by 4 percent this year, then by
another 2.6 percent in 2011, before recovering to positive growth in 2012 and beyond.Such figures seem extremely
optimistic, particularly in the face of the civil unrest now sweeping Greece and the deep hostility expressed toward
Greece in some northern European policy circles.The pattern of growth is critical because, under this program, Greece
needs to grow out of its debt problem soon. Greece's debt-to-G.D.P. ratio will be a debilitating 145 percent at the end
of 2011.Now consider putting more realistic growth figures into the I.M.F. forecast for Greece's economy — e.g., with
G.D.P. declining 12 percent in 2011, then the debt-to-G.D.P. ratio may reach 155 percent. At these levels, with a 5
percent real interest rate and no growth, the country needs a primary surplus at 8 percent of G.D.P. to keep the debt-to-
G.D.P. ratio stable. It will be nowhere near that level. The I.M.F. program has Greece running a primary budget deficit
of around 1 percent of G.D.P. in that year, and that assumes a path for Greek growth that can be regarded only as an
""upside scenario.""The politics of these implied budget surpluses remains brutal. Since most Greek debt is held abroad,
roughly 80 percent of the budget savings the Greek government makes go straight to Germans, French and other foreign
debt holders (mostly banks). If growth turns out poorly, will the Greeks be prepared for ever-tougher austerity to pay
the Germans? Even if everything goes well, Greek citizens seem unlikely to welcome this version of their ""new normal.""
Last week the European leadership panicked — very late in the day — when it realized that the euro zone itself was at
risk of a meltdown. If the euro zone proves unwilling to protect a member like Greece from default, then bond investors
will run from Portugal and Spain also — if you doubt this, study carefully the interlocking debt picture published
recently in The New York Times. Higher yields on government debt would have caused concerns about potential bank
runs in these nations, and then spread to more nations in Europe.When there is such a ""run,"" it is not clear where it
stops. In the hazy distance, Belgium, France, Austria and many others were potentially at risk.
Even the Germans cannot afford to bail out those nations.Slapped in the face by this ugly scenario, the Europeans
decided to throw everything they and the I.M.F. had at bailing out Greece. The program as announced has only a small
chance of preventing eventual Greek bankruptcy, but it may still slow or avert a dangerous spiral downward — and
enormous collateral damage — in the rest of Europe.The I.M.F. floated in some fashion an alternative scenario with a
debt restructuring, but this was rejected by both the European Union and the Greek authorities. This is not a surprise;
leading European policy makers are completely unprepared for broader problems that would follow a Greek
""restructuring,"" because markets would immediately mark down the debt (i.e., increase the yields) for Portugal, Spain,
Ireland and even Italy.The fear and panic in the face of this would be unparalleled in modern times: When the Greeks
pay only 50 percent on the face value of their debt, what should investors expect from the Portuguese and Spanish? It
all becomes arbitrary, including which countries are dragged down.Someone has to decide who should be defended and
at what cost, and the European structures are completely unsuited to this kind of tough decision-making under
pressurein the extreme downside scenario, Germany is the only obvious safe haven within the euro zone, so its
government bond yields would collapse while other governments face sharply rising yields. The euro zone would likely
not hold together.There is still a narrow escape path, without immediate debt default and the chaos that that would
produce:-
Talk down the euro — moving toward parity with the American dollar would help lift growth across the euroz one.-
As the euro falls, bond yields will rise on the euro zone periphery. This will create episodes of panic. Enough short-term
financing must be in place to support the rollover of government debt..
Once the euro has fallen a great deal, announce the European Central Bank will support the euro at those levels (i.e.,
prevent appreciation, with G-20 tacit agreement), and also support the peripheral euro zone nations viewed as solvent
by buying their bonds whenever markets are chaotic.•
At that stage, but not before, the euro zone leadership needs to push weaker governments to restructure. That will
include Greece and perhaps also Portugal. Hopefully, in this scenario Spain can muddle through.•
European banks should be recapitalized as necessary and have most of their management replaced. This is a massive
failure of euro groupthink — including most notably at the political level — but there is no question that bank executives
have not behaved responsibly in a long while and should be replaced en masse.To the extent possible, some of the
ensuing losses should be shared with bank creditors. But be careful what you wish for. The bankers are powerful for a
reason; they have built vital yet fragile structures at the heart of our economies.

5413,"NYTTop 2 Civilians Face Rockiness in Afghan Shift By MARK LANDLER The New York Times Thu, July 1, 2010
WASHINGTON — As General David H. Petraeus takes command in Afghanistan, the two top American civilian officials in
the war face an uncertain and tricky future, working with a newly empowered military leader, under the gaze of an
impatient president who has put them on notice that his fractious war council needs to pull together.
Richard C. Holbrooke, the Obama administration's special representative to the region, and Karl W. Eikenberry, the
ambassador to Afghanistan, both hung on to their jobs in the uproar that followed Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal's career-
ending quotes in Rolling Stone magazine.
But privately, at least one senior White House official suggested using General McChrystal's exit as an excuse for a
housecleaning, according to senior officials. That was rejected as too disruptive during a military campaign that relies
heavily on civilian support, these people said.
In recent days, other administration officials have begun floating the idea that Ambassador Eikenberry might be
replaced by
Ryan C. Crocker, the highly regarded former ambassador in Iraq who forged a close partnership with General Petraeus
during the successful Iraq troop increase.
Such a prospect is viewed as remote, given Mr. Crocker's prestigious new post at
Texas A&M University. But the fact that his name is being invoked underlines the challenges that confront Ambassador
Eikenberry, as he adapts to a new partner — one who has strong ideas about how soldiers and diplomats should work
together in war.
It also illustrates the remarkably powerful role that General Petraeus will assume in the nine-year-old war, setting him
up as almost a viceroy in Afghanistan and a key broker in negotiations between President
Hamid Karzai and Pakistan over an eventual political settlement.
Prior to General Petraeus's arrival, some critics said the White House had created a problem by recruiting several
forceful, ambitious personalities and giving them jobs with overlapping responsibilities. Administration officials
acknowledge that, as one said, ""There are obviously a number of substantial personalities on the team."" But the White
House believes that the current lineup can mesh, and that a difficult war demands this much talent.
Still, the McChrystal blow-up has reverberated through the State Department. Secretary of State
Hillary Rodham Clinton instructed Ambassador Eikenberry and Mr. Holbrooke to take a hard look at the civilian team,
two officials said. She is not wedded to the current lineup if it continues to bog down in internecine battles, they said.
""You can't have a major shift in a civ-mil structure without having the civilian side take a step back and look at
everything,"" said a senior State Department official, using the jargon for a civilian-military campaign.
Be
General Petraeus, whose appointment was approved 99-0 by the Senate on Wednesday, took pains at his confirmation
hearing on Tuesday to back a unified civilian and military effort. He noted then that he had telephoned Mr. Holbrooke
and would rendezvous with Ambassador Eikenberry in Brussels, so the two could land in Kabul together.
""Holbrooke has been my wingman, to a great degree,"" General Petraeus said in an interview. ""We have had, and do
have, a very good relationship."" That role, he said, will now fall to Ambassador Eikenberry.
Ambassador Eikenberry was highly critical of the Pentagon's proposal last year to send 60,000 additional troops to
Afghanistan, which led to a difficult relationship with General McChrystal. But in fact General Petraeus was the true
architect of the plan.
The ambassador, a retired lieutenant general and former commander in Afghanistan, graduated from
West Point in 1973, a year ahead of General Petraeus, but they did not know each other at the academy. The two share
a scholarly bent: General Petraeus holds a Ph.D. from Princeton, while Ambassador Eikenberry has Master's degrees
from
Harvard and Stanford.
While they were never assigned together, their careers intersected twice. In Iraq, General Eikenberry led an assessment
of Iraqi security forces while General Petraeus was commanding the 101st Airborne Division in Mosul. When General
Eikenberry was commander in Afghanistan, General Petraeus led an assessment of Afghan National Security Forces.
General Petraeus declined to discuss personnel issues, while Ambassador Eikenberry and Mr. Holbrooke turned down
requests for an interview. Mr. Crocker, now the dean of the George Bush School of Government at Texas A&M, did not
return a call for comment.
For Mr. Holbrooke, the new landscape is challenging in other ways. Officials said his job security was less in doubt than it
was six months ago, when his ouster was the subject of endless Washington chatter. Yet he has arguably become a less
central player:
Jacob J. Lew, a deputy secretary of state, manages much of the civilian influx in Afghanistan that Mr. Holbrooke helped
shape, while the embassy in Kabul is carrying it out. Mr. Holbrooke's current portfolio has played to his weaknesses, his
own allies admit. He is best as a high-level negotiator, and not as comfortable with the nitty-gritty work of helping
Afghanistan build an economy.
These days, Mr. Holbrooke has become a globe-trotting diplomat, trying to retain flagging European allies while seeking
to draw influential Muslim countries like Egypt into helping Afghanistan. At a recent conference of 35 countries in
Madrid, Mr. Holbrooke drummed up more support from allies for the Afghan government's campaign to reintegrate
Taliban fighters into mainstream society.
Mr. Karzai's longer-term effort to reconcile with Taliban leaders, and his negotiations with Pakistan, could propel Mr.
Holbrooke back into a central role. Were these talks to become more serious, several officials said, Mr. Holbrooke's
negotiating skills could be put to use, as a broker and guardian of American interests. For now, though, as evidence of
General Petraeus's influence, he will do most of the shuttling between Kabul and Islamabad.
On his last visit to the region, Mr. Holbrooke met with Mr. Karzai and with senior Pakistani officials, including the army
chief of staff,
Ashfaq Parvez Kayani. Mr. Holbrooke's past run-ins with Mr. Karzai, several officials said, have not hindered his ability to
deal with the Afghan leader, and Pakistani officials said they trusted him.
Husain Haqqani, Pakistan's ambassador to Washington, said that Mr. Holbrooke took time to understand Pakistan's
concerns. ""Ambassador Holbrooke is liked by some, admired by others and seen as effective, even by those who may
not like him,"" Mr. Haqqani said.
Still, General Petraeus is indisputably the key player, and he has wasted no time asserting his control. On a secure
videoconference call last Saturday, a person familiar with the call said, General Petraeus threw his support behind a
costly, and controversial, plan to install temporary generators to supply more electricity to Kandahar, the Taliban
stronghold that is the next major American military target.
Mr. Holbrooke and Ambassador Eikenberry swiftly assented.","['WASHINGTON', 'Afghanistan', 'Afghanistan', 'White', 'House', 'Iraq', 'Iraq', 'Afghanistan', 'Pakistan', 'Brussels', 'Kabul', 'Afghanistan', 'Afghanistan', 'West', 'Point', 'Princeton', 'Iraq', 'Mosul', 'Afghanistan', 'Texas', 'Washington', 'Afghanistan', 'Kabul', 'Afghanistan', 'Egypt', 'Afghanistan', 'Madrid', 'Pakistan', 'Kabul', 'Islamabad', 'Pakistan', 'Washington', 'Kandahar']"

etanyahu to meet Obama, but not Clinton
Eli Bardenstein, Maariv, July 1 2010 [page 7; Hebrew original here and at bottom of post]
rime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu is to leave next week for Washington, where he will meet
with US President Barack Obama. Rather curiously, he is not scheduled to meet with Secretary of State
Hillary Clinton in the course of his visit to Washington.
Contrary to his previous visit in March, this time the US administration intends to create the impression,
outwardly at least, that the severe crisis in the relationship has passed and that the relations between the
two countries are as strong as ever. In order to bolster that impression, the two leaders will meet the media
together and will be photographed. As opposed to the previous time, Netanyahu will also be put up at Blair
House, the official White House guesthouse, and not at a hotel.
That said, officials in Washington are waiting apprehensively for the answers that Netanyahu will provide in
the course of the meeting, which is expected to address the transition from the proximity talks that are at an
impasse to direct negotiations. Obama, apparently, will demand that Netanyahu agree to extend the
construction freeze in Judea and Samaria beyond the September 26 expiration date in hope of securing PA
Chairman Abu Mazen's consent to begin direct talks with Israel. For the time being, the forum of seven is
divided over this issue.

The ""Summer Camp Of Destruction:"" Israeli High Schoolers
Assist The Razing Of A Bedouin Town
On 07.31.10, By Max Blumenthal
AL-ARAKIB, ISRAEL — On July 26, Israeli police demolished 45 buildings in the unrecognized Bedouin village of al-
Arakib, razing the entire village to the ground to make way for a Jewish National Fund forest. The destruction was part of
a larger project to force the Bedouin community of the Negev away from their ancestral lands and into seven Indian
reservation-style communities the Israeli government has constructed for them. The land will then be open for Jewish
settlers, including young couples in the army and those who may someday be evacuated from the West Bank after a
peace treaty is signed. For now, the Israeli government intends to uproot as many villages as possible and erase them
from the map by establishing ""facts on the ground"" in the form of JNF forests. (See video of of al-Arakib's
demolition here).
Moments before the destruction of the Bedouin village of al-Arakib, Israeli high school age police volunteers lounge on
furniture taken from a family's home. [The following four photos are by Ata Abu Madyam of Arab Negev News.
One of the most troubling aspects of the destruction of al-Arakib was a report by CNN that the hundreds of Israeli riot
police who stormed the village were accompanied by ""busloads of cheering civilians."" Who were these civilians and why
didn't CNN or any outlet investigate further?
I traveled to al-Arakib yesterday with a delegation from Ta'ayush, an Israeli group that promotes a joint Arab-Jewish
struggle against the occupation. The activists spent the day preparing games and activities for the village's traumatized
children, helping the villagers replace their uprooted olive groves, and assisting in the reconstruction of their demolished
homes. In a massive makeshift tent where many of al-Arakib's residents now sleep, I interviewed village leaders about the
identity of the cheering civilians. Each one confirmed the presence of the civilians, describing how they celebrated the
demolitions. As I compiled details, the story grew increasingly horrific. After interviewing more than a half dozen 'elders of
the village, I was able to finally identify the civilians in question. What I discovered was more disturbing than I had
ima. med.
Israeli police youth volunteers pick through the belongings an al-Arakib family
Arab Negev News publisher Ata Abu Madyam supplied me with a series of photos he took of the civilians in action. They
depicted Israeli high school students who appeared to have volunteered as members of the Israeli police civilian guard (I
'am working on identifying some participants by name). Prior to the demolitions, the student volunteers were sent into the
villagers' homes to extract their furniture and belongings. A number of villagers including Madyam told me the volunteers
smashed windows and mirrors in their homes and defaced family photographs with crude drawings. Then they lounged
around on the furniture of al-Arakib residents in plain site of the owners. Finally, according to Matyam, the volunteers
celebrated while bulldozers destroyed the homes.
""What we learned from the summer camp of destruction,"" Madyam remarked, ""is that Israeli youth are not being educated
on democracy, they are being raised on racism."" (The cover of the latest issue of Madyam's Arab Negev News features a
photo of Palestinians being expelled to Jordan in 1948 juxtaposed with a photo of a family fleeing al-Arakib last week. The
headline reads, ""Nakba 2010."")
0
According to residents of al-Arakib, the youth volunteers vandalized homes throughout the village
The Israeli civilian guard, which incorporates 70,000 citizens including youth as young as 15 (about 15% of Israeli police
volunteers are teenagers), is one of many programs designed to incorporate Israeli children into the state's military
apparatus. It is not hard to imagine what lessons the high school students who participated in the leveling of al-Arakib took
from their experience, nor is it especially difficult to predict what sort of citizens they will become once they reach'
adulthood. Not only are they being indoctrinated to swear blind allegiance to the military, they are learning to treat the
Arab outclass as less than human. The volunteers' behavior toward Bedouins, who are citizens of Israel and serve loyally
in Israeli army combat units despite widespread racism, was strikingly reminiscent of the behavior of settler youth in
Hebron who pelt Palestinian shopkeepers in the old city with eggs, rocks and human waste. If there is a distinction
between the two cases, it is that the Hebron settlers act as vigilantes while the teenagers of Israeli civilian guard vandalize
Arab property as agents of the state.
The spectacle of Israeli youth helping destroy al-Arakib helps explain why 56% of Jewish Israeli high school students do
not believe Arabs should be allowed to serve in the Knesset — why the next generation wants apartheid. Indeed, the
widespread indoctrination of Israeli youth by the military apparatus is a central factor in Israel's authoritarian trend. It
would be difficult for any adolescent boy to escape from an experience like al-Arakib, where adults in heroic warror garb
encoura e him to articipate in and gloat over acts of massive destruction, with even a trace of democratic values.
Youth volunteers extract belongings from village homes as bulldozers move in
As for the present condition of Israeli democracy, it is essential to consider the way in which the state pits its own citizens
against one another, enlisting the Jewish majority as conquerers while targeting the Arab others as, in the wordsI of Zionist
founding father Chaim Weizmann, ""obstacles that had to be cleared on a difficult path."" Historically, only failing states
have encouraged such corrosive dynamics to take hold. That is why the scenes from al-Arakib, from the demolished
homes to the uprooted gardens to the grinning teens who joined the mayhem, can be viewed as much more than the
destruction of a village. They are snapshots of the phenomenon that is laying Israeli society as a whole to waste

haven't come up for a vote in the full Senate, leaving courtrooms idle and jobs unfilled across the upper levels of the
Obama Administration....
The tally of cloture votes reflects only a small fraction of senatorial obstruction. Three hundred and forty-five bills passed
by the House have been prevented from even coming up for debate in the Senate....

Cit and watch us for seven days,"" one senator says of the deadlocked chamber. ""You know what you'll see happening?
Nothing.""
'This is just one of those days when you want to throw up your hands and say, 'What in the world are we doing?'""
Senator Claire McCaskill, the Missouri Democrat, said.
""It's unconscionable,"" Carl Levin, the senior Democratic senator from Michigan, said. ""The obstructionism has become
mindless.""
The Senators were in the Capitol, sunk into armchairs before the marble fireplace in the press lounge, which is directly
behind the Senate chamber. It was four-thirty on a Wednesday afternoon. McCaskill, in a matching maroon jacket and
top, looked exasperated; Levin glowered over his spectacles.
""Also, it's a dumb rule in itself,"" McCaskill said. ""It's time we started looking at some of these rules.""
She was referring to Senate Rule XXVI, Paragraph 5, which requires unanimous consent for committees and
subcommittees to hold hearings after two in the afternoon while the Senate is in session. Both Levin and McCaskill had
scheduled hearings that day for two-thirty. Typically, it wouldn't be difficult to get colleagues to waive the rule; a general
and an admiral had flown halfway around the world to appear before Levin's Armed Services Committee, and McCaskill's
Subcommittee on Contracting Oversight of the Homeland Security Committee was investigating the training of Afghan
police. But this was March 24th, the day after President Barack Obama signed the health-care-reform bill, in a victory
ceremony at the White House; it was also the day that the Senate was to vote on a reconciliation bill for health-care
reform, approved by the House three nights earlier, which would retroactively remove the new law's most embarrassing
sweetheart deals and complete the yearlong process of passing universal health care. Republicans, who had fought the
bill as a bloc, were in no mood to make things easy.
So, four hours earlier, when Levin went to the Senate floor and asked for consent to hold his hearing, Senator Richard
Burr, Republican of North Carolina, and a member of Levin's committee, had refused. ""I have no personal objection to
continuing,"" Burr said. But, he added, ""there is objection on our side of the aisle. Therefore, I would have to object.""
Burr had to object on behalf of his party because he was the only Republican in the chamber when Levin spoke. In
general, when senators give speeches on the floor, their colleagues aren't around, and the two or three who might be
present aren't listening. They're joking with aides, or e-mailing Twitter ideas to their press secretaries, or getting their first
look at a speech they're about to give before the eight unmanned cameras that provide a live feed to C-SPAN2. The
presiding officer of the Senate—freshmen of the majority party take rotating, hour-long shifts intended to introduce them to
the ways of the institution—sits in his chair on the dais, scanning his BlackBerry or reading a Times article about the
Senate. Michael Bennet, a freshman Democrat from Colorado, said, ""Sit and watch us for seven days—just watch the
floor. You know what you'll see happening? Nothing. When I'm in the chair, I sit there thinking, I wonder what they're
doing in China right now?""
Between speeches, there are quorum calls, time killers in which a Senate clerk calls the roll at the rate of one name every
few minutes. The press gallery, above the dais, is typically deserted, as journalists prefer to hunker down in the press
lounge, surfing the Web for analysis of current Senate negotiations; television screens alert them if something of interest
actually happens in the chamber. The only people who pay attention to a speech are the Senate stenographers. On this
afternoon, two portly bald men in suits stood facing the speaker from a few feet away, tapping at the transcription
machines, which resembled nineteenth-century cash registers, slung around their necks. The Senate chamber is an
intimate room where men and women go to talk to themselves for the record.
Like many other aspects of senatorial procedure, Rule XXVI, Paragraph 5 is a relic from the days when senators had to
hover around their desks to know what was happening on the floor during the main afternoon debate. (The desks, some
built as long ago as 1819, are mahogany, and their lids lift up, like those in an old schoolhouse; the desks of the Majority
and Minority Leader are still equipped with brass spittoons.) In the press lounge, McCaskill said, with light sarcasm,
""Somebody told me the rule is to make sure people pay attention to what's happening on the floor during debate and not
be distracted by committee work. Clearly, it's an old rule.""
The Republicans had turned this old rule into a new means of obstruction. There would be no hearings that afternoon; the
general and the admiral would have to come back another day. Like investment bankers on Wall Street, senators these
days direct much of their creative energy toward the manipulation of arcane rules and loopholes, scoring short-term
successes while magnifying their institution's broader dysfunction.
Around five o'clock, the chamber began to fill, as the reconciliation bill came up for a vote; there were twenty-three
amendments pending, all from Republicans, and perhaps many more to come. Ordinarily, debate and voting on an
amendment might take two legislative days, but under the rules of the reconciliation bill the senators were to dispatch the
amendments one after another, as in a hot-dog-eating contest, with a minute of debate for each side. The goal was to
finish the bill by the end of the evening, so that senators wouldn't miss a day of their spring recess—apparently, the only
thing worse than a government takeover of the health-care system. The usual longueurs of the Senate, where forty
minutes can tick away on the antique clock above the rear double doors without a word's being spoken, were about to
yield to a frenzy. Harry Reid, the Majority Leader, from Nevada, had predicted that the process, known as Vote-O-Rama,
would go past two in the morning, and had warned senators to stay close to the chamber.
Max Baucus, of Montana, the manager of the bill for the Democrats, rose and said, ""This is the first time in recent memory
that a reconciliation bill has all the amendments on one side only. These are clearly amendments designed to kill the
reconciliation and, therefore, kill health-care reform. So I very much hope that all of these amendments are defeated.""
Tall, gaunt Judd Gregg, of New Hampshire, the bill's Republican manager, took the floor. ""The position on the other side
of the aisle is: no amendments allowed, even if they are good,"" he said. Indignation rouged his cheeks, and his voice rose
half an octave. ""Obviously, they presume the Republican Party is an inconvenience. The democratic process is an
inconvenience. It also appears, considering the opposition to this out in America, that the American people are an
inconvenience.""
The Senate chamber is laid out in four concentric semicircles, with adjacent desks almost touching on the crowded
Democratic side, and the desks of the much smaller Republican minority spaced loosely apart. The design is meant to
emphasize the senators' unity. But Baucus and Gregg avoided eye contact across the six feet of aisle that now divides the
chamber into two constantly warring factions. Senators are required, by custom, to speak of one another in the third
person, directing their anger and sarcasm through whichever poor freshman happens to be the presiding officer at the
moment. Rule XIX, Paragraphs 2 and 3—one of the original rules drawn from Thomas Jefferson's ""Manual of
Parliamentary Practice""—bars senators from imputing unworthy conduct or motives to another senator, and from insulting
any senator's state. But there is no rule against finger-wagging, and Baucus wagged his at Gregg while shouting at Al
Franken, of Minnesota, who had started a shift in the presiding officer's chair: ""Mr. President, make no mistake, the intent
of every single one of the amendments offered on the other side of the aisle is to kill health-care reform. . . . A senator on
the other side of the aisle stood up and said that this is hopefully the President's Waterloo. They want to kill health-care
reform!""
The voice of Stuart Smalley filled the chamber: ""The time of the senator has expired.""
For the next nine hours, the chamber became the stage of a theatrical whose ending, like almost everything that happens
on the Senate floor, was known in advance to all. The Republican goal in Vote-O-Rama was to embarrass the Democrats
while appearing to suggest useful changes; the Democratic goal was to prevent any change to the bill, so that it wouldn't
have to return to the House, where it might be voted down. Several of the Republican amendments had been designed to
make Democrats look hypocritical, by forcing them to vote against policies that the Party typically supports. One
amendment, for example, declared that the health-care bill could not be linked to a tax hike on individuals making less
than two hundred thousand dollars a year. Other amendments were more nakedly partisan, and outlandish. David Vitter, a
Louisiana Republican, proposed an amendment that repealed the entire law. Senator Tom Coburn, a Republican
obstetrician from Oklahoma, introduced an amendment to insure that veterans diagnosed with mental illness would not be
denied the right to own firearms, and another to prevent ""convicted child molesters, rapists, and sex offenders"" from
buying erectile-dysfunction drugs with taxpayer funds. Coburn got through the minute he was allotted to explain his Viagra
amendment without cracking a smile. ""This is not a game amendment,"" he insisted. ""It actually saves money.""
So many senators snickered that the presiding officer banged his gavel for order.
""The amendment offered by the senator from Oklahoma makes a mockery of this Senate,"" Baucus declared. ""It is a crass
political stunt aimed at making thirty-second commercials, not public policy."" Baucus asked for the yeas and nays, and a
clerk called the roll at a ragged pace. ""Mr. Coburn, Mr. Cochran, Ms. Collins."" Thirty-five-second pause. ""Mr. Conrad, Mr.
Corker."" Ten seconds. ""Mr. Cornyn."" Senators pay no attention to the sound of their name; they cast votes when they're
so inclined—wandering in late, shuffling down the chamber's gentle blue-carpeted steps to the swarm of colleagues
milling about in the well, where the clerks sit at a table, and then holding a finger up or down. At one point, John McCain—
now just one of a hundred senators and struggling to stay in office—spent half a minute waving stiff-armed, trying to catch
the eye of a clerk so he could cast his vote. In the end, two Democrats—Evan Bayh, of Indiana, and Ben Nelson, of
Nebraska—joined the Republicans in opposing Viagra for sex offenders. The amendment was defeated.
The carpeting in the chamber absorbs voices, and during the long night one of the few that rose above the muffled drone
was that of Charles Schumer, who said to Gregg, ""Get to work! Stop screwing around with health care!"" Sporadically, a
sharp cackle emanated from Al Franken, who wandered the chamber, looking for Republicans he could charm into
laughing. Observed from the press gallery, the senators in their confined space began to resemble zoo animals—Levin a
shambling brown bear, John Thune a loping gazelle, Jim Bunning a maddened grizzly. Each one displayed a limited set of
behaviors: in conversations, John Kerry planted himself a few inches away, loomed, and clamped his hands down on a
colleague's shoulders. Joe Lieberman patted everyone on the back. It became clear which senators were loners (Russ
Feingold, Daniel Akaka) and which were social (Blanche Lincoln, Lindsey Graham); which senators were important (Dick
Durbin, Jon Kyl) and which were ignored (Bayh, Bunning).
Past midnight, Durbin slumped at his desk, one hand over his face, yawning painfully. Susan Collins was going through
her mail. Twenty-three amendments had been voted down, and the Republicans were proposing a fresh batch. ""Can we
get some order?"" Bunning growled, before he introduced a proposal to let senior citizens opt out of parts of Medicare. It
was the only amendment that any Republicans joined the Democrats to defeat.
Harry Reid controls the Senate's schedule, but Mitch McConnell, of Kentucky, who is the Minority Leader, can object.
Since nearly everything in the Senate depends on unanimous consent, the main business of the place is a continuous
negotiation between these two supremely unsentimental men. That night, they played a game of chicken: McConnell,
unsmiling, his eyes riveted ahead, held out the prospect of dozens more amendments; Reid, a former boxer, was
hunched and mumbling, playing rope-a-dope, vowing to fend off amendments all night. The two leaders left the chamber
to confer privately about how to proceed. Inside, the atmosphere of a slumber party set in. Debbie Stabenow, of Michigan,
her hand across her heart, sang a sentimental duet with Robert Menendez, of New Jersey. Exhaustion momentarily
eased the partisan divide. Claire McCaskill sat down beside Tom Coburn, held up an erect finger in his face, as if casting
her Viagra vote, then let it go limp. Coburn could be heard to joke, ""The longest it lasted was thirty seconds.""
At two-forty-five in the morning, Reid suddenly declared the Senate adjourned. The Senate parliamentarian had just found
two small violations of the reconciliation rules, meaning that in the morning, despite the Democrats' efforts, the bill would
go back to the House for another vote. At the bang of the gavel, the senators fled. In the parking lot, on the Capitol's
northeast side, McCaskill climbed into her S.U.V. Levin, in a cramped sedan, was chauffeured off into the empty streets.
On a marble ledge near the exit, Arlen Specter sat alone, a ghost in a brown suit, staring straight ahead, as if waiting for
someone to take him away.
The Senate reconvened at 9:45 A.M. Around two in the afternoon, the members gathered for the final vote, and the
Democrats were giddy. Tom Harkin, of Iowa, and Christopher Dodd, of Connecticut, even exchanged a hug. ""Everyone's
tired,"" Reid declared before the final vote. ""This legislative fight is one for the record books."" He was so fatigued that he
initially voted the wrong way. Lindsey Graham came in late, delaying the tally by ten minutes. ""Way to go, Lindsey, way to
stretch it out,"" Sam Brownback told him. A few Republicans lingered and took in the moment, like players on the losing
team at the end of the World Series. After a year of work, health-care reform had passed, 56-43, and for a moment the
chamber's Tweeting pygmies had become legislative giants.
The Senate is often referred to as ""the world's greatest deliberative body."" Jeff Merkley, a freshman Democrat from
Oregon, said, ""That is a phrase that I wince each time I hear it, because the amount of real deliberation, in terms of
exchange of ideas, is so limited."" Merkley could remember witnessing only one moment of floor debate between a
Republican and a Democrat. ""The memory I took with me was: 'Wow, that's unusual—there's a conversation occurring in
which they're making point and counterpoint and challenging each other.' And yet nobody else was in the chamber.""
Tom Udall, a freshman Democrat from New Mexico, could not recall seeing a senator change another senator's mind.
""You would really need a good hour or two of extensive exchange among folks that really know the issue,"" he said.
Instead, a senator typically gives ""a prepared speech that's already been vetted through the staff. Then another guy gets
up and gives a speech on a completely different subject."" From time to time, senators of the same party carry on a
colloquy—""I would be interested in the distinguished senator from Iowa's view of the other side's Medicare Advantage
plan""—that has been scripted in advance by aides.
While senators are in Washington, their days are scheduled in fifteen-minute intervals: staff meetings, interviews, visits
from lobbyists and home-state groups, caucus lunches, committee hearings, briefing books, floor votes, fund-raisers.
Each senator sits on three or four committees and even more subcommittees, most of which meet during the same
morning hours, which helps explain why committee tables are often nearly empty, and why senators drifting into a hearing
can barely sustain a coherent line of questioning. All this activity is crammed into a three-day week, for it's an unwritten
rule of the modern Senate that votes are almost never scheduled for Mondays or Fridays, which allows senators to spend
four days away from the capital. Senators now, unlike those of several decades ago, often keep their families in their
home states, where they return most weekends, even if it's to Alaska or Idaho—a concession to endless fund-raising, and
to the populist anti-Washington mood of recent years. (When Newt Gingrich became Speaker of the House, in 1995, he
told new Republican members not to move their families to the capital.) Tom Daschle, the former Democratic leader, said,
""When we scheduled votes, the only day where we could be absolutely certain we had all one hundred senators there
was Wednesday afternoon.""
Nothing dominates the life of a senator more than raising money. Tom Harkin, the Iowa Democrat, said, ""Of any free time
you have, I would say fifty per cent, maybe even more,"" is spent on fund-raising. In addition to financing their own
campaigns, senators participate at least once a week in the Power Hour, during which they make obligatory calls on
behalf of the Party (in the Democrats' case, from a three-story town house across Constitution Avenue from the Senate
office buildings, since they're barred from using their own offices to raise money). Lamar Alexander, the Tennessee
Republican, insisted that the donations are never sufficient to actually buy a vote, but he added, ""It sucks up time that a
senator ought to be spending getting to know other senators, working on issues.""
In June, 2009, top aides to Max Baucus, whose Finance Committee was negotiating the health-care-reform bill, took time
to meet with two health-care lobbyists, who themselves were former Baucus aides. (Baucus received more than a million
dollars from the industry for his 2008 reelection campaign.) That month, according to Common Cause, industry groups
were spending $1.4 million a day to lobby members of Congress. Udall, speaking of the corrosive effect of fund-raising
and lobbying, said, ""People know it in their heart—they know this place is dominated by special interests. The over-all bills
are not nearly as bold because of the influence of money.""
Deschle sketched a portrait of the contemporary senator who is too busy to think: ""Sometimes, you're dialling for dollars,
you get the call, you've got to get over to vote, you've got fifteen minutes. You don't have a clue what's on the floor, your
staff is whispering in your ears, you're running onto the floor, then you check with your leader—you double check—but,
just to make triple sure, there's a little sheet of paper on the clerk's table: The leader recommends an aye vote, or a no
vote. So you've got all these checks just to make sure you don't screw up, but even then you screw up sometimes. But, if
you're ever pressed, 'Why did you vote that way?'—you just walk out thinking, Oh, my God, I hope nobody asks, because
I don't have a clue.""
Aides, at the elbows of senators as they shuttle between their offices and the Capitol, have proliferated over the past few
decades, and they play a crucial role. Lamar Alexander, who has an office of fifty people, pointed out that staff members,
who are younger and often more ideological than their bosses, and less dependent on institutional relationships, tend to
push senators toward extremes. Often, aides are the main actors behind proposed legislation—writing bills, negotiating
the details—while the senator is relegated to repeating talking points on Fox' or MSNBC.
One day in his office, Udall picked up some tabloids from his coffee table and waved them at me. ""You know about all
these rags that cover the Hill, right?"" he said, smiling. There are five dailies—Politico, The Hill, Roll Call, Con gressDaily,
and CQ Today—all of which emphasize insider conflict. The senators, who like to complain about the trivializing effect of
the ""24/7 media,"" provide no end of fodder for it. The news of the day was what Udall called a ""dust-up"" between Scott
Brown, the freshman Massachusetts Republican, and a staffer for Jim DeMint, the arch-conservative from South Carolina;
the staffer had Tweeted that Brown was voting too often with the Democrats, leading Brown to confront DeMint on the
Senate floor over this supposed breach of protocol. Bloggers carry so much influence that many senators have a young
press aide dedicated to the care and feeding of online media. News about, by, and for a tiny kingdom of political
obsessives dominates the attention of senators and staff, while stories that might affect their constituents go unreported
because their home-state papers can no longer afford to have bureaus in Washington. Dodd, who came to the Senate in
1981 and will leave next January, told me, ""I used to have eleven Connecticut newspaper reporters who covered me on a
daily basis. I don't have one today, and haven't had one in a number of years. Instead, D.C. publications only see me
through the prism of conflict."" Lamar Alexander described the effect as ""this instant radicalizing of positions to the left and
the right.""
Both Alexander and Gregg said that the Senate had been further polarized by the rising number of senators—now nearly
fifty—who come from the House, rather than from governorships or other positions where bipartisan coOperation is still
permissible. ""A lot of senators don't understand the history or tradition of the institution,"" Gregg said. ""Substantive,
thoughtful, moderate discussion is pushed aside.""
Encumbered with aides, prodded by hourly jolts from electronic media, racing from the hearing room to the caucus lunch
to the Power Hour to the airport, senators no longer have the time, or perhaps the inclination, to get to know one
another—least of all, members of the other party. Friendships across party lines are more likely among the few spouses
who live in Washington. After Udall joined the Senate, last year, he was invited to dinner by Alexander, because Jill
Cooper Udall and Honey Alexander had become friends through a women's social club. It remains the only time Udall has
set foot in the house of a Republican senator. (Vice-President Joe Biden, in his autobiography, recalls that, in the
seventies, a bipartisan group of senators and their wives hosted a monthly dinner: ""In those days Democrats and
Republicans actually enjoyed each other's company."") When I asked Chris Dodd how well he knew, for example, Jim
DeMint, Dodd said, ""Not at all. Whereas Jesse Helms and I knew each other pretty well."" He repeated something that Jon
Kyl, the Republican whip, from Arizona, had recently said to him: ""There's no trust."" Dodd, whose father was a senator,
went on, ""That's really all there is—this place really operates on that. I don't think anyone would argue with that
conclusion. And if that's missing.
There remains a veneer—badly chipped—of comity. On the floor, senators still refer to members of the opposing party as
""friends."" Gregg described Kent Conrad, a Democrat from North Dakota, as ""one of my best friends in the Senate,"" and
both Gregg and Alexander ticked off examples of little-known legislation that they are currently working on with
Democrats; Alexander and Ben Cardin, of Maryland, have introduced a bill to ban mountaintop-removal coal mining. Udall
noted that he had become friendly with John McCain when they went on a congressional tour of Iraq. But opportunities to
bond are rare. On the first floor of the Capitol, there is a private dining room for senators, the ""inner sanctum,"" where
Republicans and Democrats used to have lunch (at separate tables, but in the same room). In the seventies, old bulls
such as James Eastland, Hubert Humphrey, and Jacob Javits held court there; later, Daniel Patrick Moynihan did. ""You
learned, and also you found out what was going on,"" Dodd said, adding, ""It's awfully difficult to say crappy things about
someone that you just had lunch with."" These days, the inner sanctum is nearly always empty. Senators eat lunch in their
respective caucus rooms with members of their party, or else ""downtown,"" which means asking donors for money over
steak and potatoes at the Monocle or Charlie Palmer. The tradition of the ""caucus lunch"" was instituted by Republicans in
the fifties, when they lost their majority; Democrats, after losing theirs in 1980, followed suit. Caucus lunches work
members on both sides into a state of pep-rally fervor. During one recent Republican lunch, Jim Bunning referred to Harry
Reid as an idiot. ""At least he had the courtesy to do it behind closed doors,"" Alexander joked, adding, ""We spend most of
our time in team meetings deciding what we're going to do to each other.""
In 2007, Alexander and Lieberman started a series of bipartisan Tuesday breakfasts. ""They kind of dwindled off during the
health-care debate,"" Alexander said. Udall has tried to revive the Wednesday inner-sanctum lunch. For the first few
months, only Democrats attended. Then, one Wednesday in May, Susan Collins, the Maine Republican, showed up,
joking nervously about being a turncoat; to protect her reputation, her presence was kept secret.
These efforts at resurrecting dead customs are as self-conscious and, probably, as doomed as the get-togethers of lovers
who try to stay friends after a breakup. Ira Shapiro, a Washington lawyer and a former aide to Senator Gaylord Nelson, of
Wisconsin, put it this way: ""Why would they want to have lunch together when they hate each other?""
The upper chamber of Congress was a constitutional compromise between popular sovereignty and state sovereignty.
The Senate was designed, as part of the separation of powers, to check the impulses of the House and the popular will.
For some Federalists, it also had an aristocratic purpose: to collect knowledge and experience, and to guard against a
levelling spirit that might overtake the majority. When Alexis de Tocqueville visited the Senate, in 1832, he was deeply
impressed by the quality of its members: ""They represent only the lofty thoughts [of the nation] and the generous instincts
animating it, not the petty passions."" But he also recognized that ""a minority of the nation dominating the Senate could
completely paralyze the will of the majority represented in the other house, and that is contrary to the spirit of
constitutional government."" As long as the Senate continued to be composed of America's most talented statesmen,
Tocqueville implied, it would restrain its own anti-democratic potential.
Robert A. Caro, in ""Master of the Senate,"" the third volume of his life of Lyndon Johnson, argues that after the Civil War •
the Senate was captured by wealthy and sectional interests, ending a more high-minded age when Daniel Webster, Henry
Clay, and John C. Calhoun engaged in brilliant debate. Aside from spasms of legislation at the start of the Presidencies of
Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt, Caro writes, the Senate remained controlled by an alliance of Southern racists
and Republican corporate shills, and was ""the dam against which the waves of social reform dashed themselves in vain—
the chief obstructive force in the federal government."" By the fifties, the Senate had become far more conservative than
the public. And not just conservative: William S. White, in his 1956 book ""Citadel,"" called the Senate ""to a most peculiar
degree, a Southern Institution . . . growing at the heart of this ostensibly national assembly"" and ""the only place in the
country where the South did not lose the war.""
By mid-century, it had become a journalistic cliché to call the Senate broken. Otto Preminger's 1962 film ""Advise and
Consent,"" based on the novel by Allen Drury, is about the Senate of that period, and it presents Democrats and
Republicans as equally amoral, calculating, and power-hungry. But the institution, as depicted by Preminger, still works, in
its way: though the deals stink, they get cut. The senators know their colleagues and the rules; they back-stab one
another in the lunchroom, then drink cocktails and play cards on Saturday nights. There are no lobbyists, no fund-raisers,
no media, no constituents—only senators' intricate relations with one another. The Senate is its own world.
In a memoir, Johnson's longtime aide Harry McPherson recalls learning that the Senate's ""famous 'club' atmosphere is
based on the members' mutual acceptance of responsibility and concentration on the tasks at hand. . . . They thrust hard
at one another in debate over serious matters,"" but, he writes, ""understanding and accommodation in the ordinary course
of the Senate day was essential to sanity."" Johnson, the most powerful Majority Leader in history, bent the Senate to his
will and forced it to become more efficient. He saw his colleagues as either ""whales""—the heavyweight chairmen who
negotiated legislation—or ""minnows,"" the followers who went along with the brokered deals. And when, in 1958, a
formidable new class of liberal Democrats entered the Senate—including Edmund Muskie, Eugene McCarthy, and Philip
Hart—the legislative machinery began to produce reform. Michael Janeway, the author of ""The Fall of the House of
Roosevelt,"" worked as a summer staff member between 1958 and 1962. ""They used to talk to each other—that's my most
vivid recollection,"" he said. ""If Wayne Morse talked of constitutional law on the floor, the Southerners would come in to
hear him. The same with Hubert Humphrey on farm policy. My strongest impression was of it being a deliberative body,
drawing each other out—sometimes pedantically."" Senators who ran for office in order to work on foreign policy, social
welfare, or urbanization had to win credibility with the whales. ""But if you wanted to do something there was a mechanism
by which you could do it,"" Janeway said.
In the sixties and seventies, Southern-conservative control was broken by a coalition of left-of-center Democrats and
moderate Republicans. Donald Ritchie, the Senate historian, who started working there in 1976, described the Senate of
those decades as ""a bipartisan liberal institution."" The Civil Rights Act of 1964 was written largely out of the office of the
Republican Minority Leader, Everett Dirksen. Every major initiative—voting rights, open housing, environmental law,
campaign reform—enjoyed bipartisan support. In the rare event of a filibuster, the motion to end debate was often filed
jointly by leaders of both parties. When Medicare—that government takeover of health care for the elderly—was passed,
in 1965, it won 70-24.
The Senate's momentum nurtured superb talent: William Fulbright, Everett Dirksen, Henry Jackson, Frank Church,
Howard Baker. In 1969, George McGovern chaired a select committee on hunger that actually held bipartisan ""field
hearings"" in poor regions, calling witnesses in migrant labor camps, and then, with Bob Dole's indispensable support,
greatly expanded the food-stamp program. The intensity of senatorial purpose in those years must strike today's
legislators as profoundly humbling. After Joe Biden came to the Senate, in 1973, Hubert Humphrey took him aside and
said, ""You have to pick an issue that becomes yours. That's how you attract your colleagues to follow you, Joe. That's
how you demonstrate your bona fides. Don't be a gadfly."" Humphrey's career advice: ""You should become Mr. Housing.
Housing is the future.""
The Senate's modern decline began in 1978, with the election of a new wave of anti-government conservatives, and
accelerated as Republicans became the majority in 1981. ""The Quayle generation came in, and there were a number of
people just like Dan—same generation, same hair style, same beliefs,"" Gary Hart, the Colorado Democrat, recalled. ""They
were harder-line. They weren't there to get along with Democrats. But they look accommodationist compared to
Republicans in the Senate today."" Church, McGovern, Javits, and Birch Bayh were gone. Ira Shapiro, the former aide,
who is writing a book about the Senate of the sixties and seventies, said, ""It was a huge loss of the most experienced,
accomplished senators being replaced by neophytes. All of a sudden, in 1981, more than half the Senate had been there
less than six years."" He added, ""The shattering of the great Senate has long-term effects that keep showing up. It gets
worse over time, but it just never gets restored. There was a phrase I heard from Helms and the younger ones: 'Others
didn't want to make waves; I wanted to drain the swamp.'""
After C-SPAN went on the air, in 1979, the cozy atmosphere that encouraged both deliberation and back-room deals
began to yield to transparency and, with it, posturing. ""So Damn Much Money,"" a recent book by the Washington Post
reporter Robert G. Kaiser, traces the spectacular rise of Washington lobbying to the same period. Liberal Republicans
began to disappear, and as Southern Democrats died out they were replaced by conservative Republicans. Bipartisan
coalitions on both wings of the Senate vanished. The institutionalist gave way to the free agent, who controlled his own
fund-raising apparatus and media presence, and whose electoral base was a patchwork of single-issue groups. Members
of both parties—Howard Metzenbaum, the Ohio Democrat; Jesse Helms, the North Carolina Republican—took to
regularly using the Senate's rules to tie up business for narrowly ideological reasons. The number of filibusters shot up in
the eighties and continued to rise in the following decades, as the parties kept alternating control of the Senate and
escalating a procedural arms race, routinely blocking the confirmation of executive and judicial appointees. Democrats
filibustered Republican nominees to the bench; then Republicans threatened to ban the filibuster in such cases—the so-
called ""nuclear option."" Older members were perturbed when, in 2004, the Republican Majority Leader, Bill Frist, went to
South Dakota to campaign against the Democratic Minority Leader, Tom Daschle (who went on to lose). A few years
earlier, such an action would have been unthinkable.
The weakened institution could no longer withstand pressures from outside its walls; as money and cameras rushed in,
independent minds fell more and more in line with the partisans. Rough parity between the two parties meant that every
election had the potential to make or break a majority, crushing the incentive to cooperate across the aisle. The Senate,
no longer a fount of ideas, became a backwater of the U.S. government. During the Clinton years, the main action was
between the White House and the Gingrich House of Representatives; during the Bush years, the Republican Senate
majority abdicated the oversight role that could have placed a vital check on executive power.
Norman Ornstein, a congressional expert at the American Enterprise Institute, said that the Senate has increasingly
become populated by ""ideologues and charlatans."" He went on, ""When we do get good people who come in, they very
quickly get ground up by the dynamic and the culture of the parties. And once you get there, look at what it takes to stay
there."" He spoke of Charles Grassley, the Iowa Republican, who, nearing the end of his career, spent much of last year
working closely with his friend Max Baucus on the health-care bill. Then, in August, Grassley went home and, faced with
angry Republican voters and the prospect of a primary challenge from the right, started warning about ""pulling the plug on
Grandma."" Ornstein added that similar pressures had led John McCain to begin ""altering his behavior and abandoning
every issue, including campaign-finance reform.""
One morning in April, I visited Harry McPherson, the former L.B.J. aide, at the offices of the legal and lobbying firm D. L.
A. Piper, in downtown Washington. McPherson, who is eighty, had on his desk the firm's spiral-bound directory for the
111th Congress. I asked him who, in Johnsonian terms, were the whales of the current Senate. McPherson ran his finger
down the list of senators. He did it again. ""I'm trying here, looking for a remote descendant. Judas Priest, look at this."" He
was stumped. ""Well, I see some good people, I see some people who are going to get coalitions together over time."" He
put the directory aside. ""I'm just having the damnedest time.""
Down the hall from McPherson's office was that of Mel Martinez, a former Republican senator from Florida; he was hired
last year, two weeks after resigning his Senate seat without completing his first term. (He has since moved on to
JPMorgan Chase.) William Cohen, the former Maine senator and Secretary of Defense, has an office downstairs. Tom
Daschle works at D. L. A. Piper; his predecessor as Democratic leader, George Mitchell, was the firm's chairman, until
President Obama appointed him to be his Middle East envoy. One feature of the diminished U.S. senator is the ease with
which he moves from legislating to lobbying. Between 1998 and 2004, half the senators who left office became lobbyists.
In 2007, Trent Lott, a Republican leader in the Senate less than a year into his fourth term, abruptly resigned and formed
a lobbying firm with former Senator John Breaux, just a few weeks before a new law took effect requiring a two-year
waiting period between serving and lobbying.
When you spend your days at the Senate, it's easy to forget about everything else. The House of Representatives seems
miles away (it's just down a corridor and across the rotunda), the White House is another country, and actual foreign
countries are unimaginable. The place remains insular, labyrinthine, and opaque—even physically. Senators commute
thirty seconds between their offices and the chamber by electric subway cars that run along a tunnel under Constitution
Avenue. Many signs are misleading or obsolete (the gilded lettering over the visitors' gallery says ""Men's Gallery""), and
the Capitol is filled with secret passageways and spare rooms, called hideaways, doled out according to seniority, where
senators can read, drink, doze, and wait for the buzzer announcing an imminent vote. The most pervasive authority over
the institution is not the Constitution or the Bible but, rather, an impenetrable sixteen-hundred-page tome, by Floyd M.
Riddick, called ""Senate Procedure: Precedents and Practices,"" which only the late Robert Byrd, of West Virginia, was
known to have read in its entirety. The procedures are so abstruse that a parliamentarian must sit below the presiding
officer and, essentially, tell him or her what to say.
After half a century, the picture given by Preminger's ""Advise and Consent"" is still faintly visible. ""The Senate, by its
nature, is a place where consensus reigns and personal relationships are paramount,"" Lamar Alexander said. ""And that's
not changed."" Which is exactly the problem: it's a self-governing body that depends on the reasonableness of its
members to function. Sarah Binder, a congressional scholar at George Washington University, said, ""To have a chamber
that rules by unanimous consent—it's nutty! Especially when you've got Jim Bunning to please.""
In 2006 and 2008, sixteen Democrats entered the Senate, giving the Party its current majority of fifty-nine to forty-one
(counting two independents). They include moderates, like Jon Tester, of Montana, and Mark Warner, of Virginia; liberals,
like Sherrod Brown, of Ohio, and Sheldon Whitehouse, of Rhode Island; policy specialists, like Amy Klobuchar, of
Minnesota, and Jeff Merkley; and iconoclasts, like Claire McCaskill. Their interest in legislating has won the admiration of
senior senators. ""If they can stay, I think they'll be terrific,"" Chris Dodd said. ""My worry is they won't stay. Because it's not
productive.""
The Democratic class of 2008 arrived with President Obama, expecting to usher in 6 dynamic new era. Instead, their
young Senate careers have passed in a daily slog of threatened filibusters and ""secret holds""—when a senator
anonymously objects to bringing an appointment up for a vote, which requires unanimous consent. On April 20th, Claire
McCaskill took the trouble to read off the names of fifty-six Obama nominees languishing in the limbo of secret holds, and
Jon Kyl objected to every one of them. Just getting a bill to the floor for debate can require days of tactical gamesmanship
between the party leaders. There were times when Warner wondered if anyone had ever quit in the first year. Michael
Bennet said, ""We find ourselves at a moment in our history when the questions are huge ones, not small ones, and where
things have been put off for a really long period of time."" He mentioned the national debt, energy policy, and the financial
crisis. ""Yet you have a Senate that's designed not to advance change but to slow it.""
We were talking in his hideaway, a windowless room in the Capitol basement, which had a mini-fridge stocked with bottled
water, black leatherette furniture circa 1962, and a TV tuned to C-SPAN2 on mute; Senator Kyl's mouth was moving.
Bennet, the former superintendent of schools in Denver, was appointed to a vacant seat in 2009, and already has to
defend it this year. He described the Senate with the dry bluntness of an outsider who hasn't allowed himself to grow too
attached. Bennet repeated a story he had heard. about a new congressman giving his maiden speech: ""And then some
more veteran guy came over and said, 'Son, you're talking like this place is on the level. It's not on the level.' As the fifteen
months or so have gone by that I've been here, the less on the level it seems.""
Earlier this year, the Senate's procedural absurdities became national news twice in one month. On February 4th,
Con gressDaily reported that Richard Shelby, an Alabama Republican, was secretly blocking the confirmation of seventy
Obama appointees over a dispute involving defense earmarks for his•state. (His tactics exposed, Shelby—whose office
maintains that he was responsible for fewer than fifty holds—lifted all but three.) Later that month, Bunning spent several
days and a late night on the Senate floor, filibustering to prevent benefits from being paid to millions of unemployed
Americans. When Merkley tried to reason with him, Bunning responded, ""Tough shit."" (Eventually, Republicans persuaded
Bunning to stop.)
These incidents elicited a brief outcry, but the extent of the Senate's routine folly remains largely hidden. For example,
Grassley and Ron Wyden, of Oregon, have been trying since 1997 to end the practice of secret holds, without success. In
2007, the Senate passed a bill banning secret holds that last longer than six days. But to get around the ban two or more
senators can pass the hold back and forth—it's called ""rolling holds""—and their party leader facilitates the game by
keeping their names secret.
Many of the Senate's antique rules and precedents have been warped beyond recognition by the modern pressures of
partisanship. The hold, for example, was a courtesy extended to senators in the days of horse travel, when they needed
time to get back to Washington and read a bill or question an appointee before casting their vote. Sarah Binder, who co-
authored a book on the filibuster, calls the procedure a historical accident: in 1806, the Senate got rid of a little-used rule
that allowed the ""previous question"" to be called to a vote. Suddenly, there was no inherent limit on debate, and by the
eighteen-thirties senators had begun taking advantage of this loophole, derailing the proceedings by getting up and talking
until their voice, legs, or bladder gave out. (The word ""filibuster' comes from vrijbuiter—old Dutch for ""looter."")
In 1917, Woodrow Wilson, with his wartime legislative agenda blocked by filibusters, forced the Senate to pass Rule XXII,
which allowed a two-thirds majority to bring a floor debate to an end with a ""cloture"" vote. For decades, the rule was rarely
used; between 1919 and 1971, there were only forty-nine cloture votes, fewer than one per year. In the seventies and
eighties, the annual average rose to about a dozen. (Frustration with this increase led the Senate, in 1975, to lower the
threshold for cloture to sixty votes.) In the nineties and early aughts, the average went up to twenty-five or thirty a year, as
both parties escalated their use of the filibuster when they found themselves in the minority. After the Republicans lost
their majority in 2006, filibusters became everyday events: there were a hundred and twelve cloture votes in 2007 and
2008, and this session Republicans are on target to break their own filibuster record.
The tally of cloture votes reflects only a small fraction of senatorial obstruction. Three hundred and forty-five bills passed
by the House have been prevented from even coming up for debate in the Senate. ""Why?"" Steny Hoyer, the outraged
Democratic Majority Leader of the House, asked me. ""Because they do not do their business in a way that facilitates
noncontroversial things. Thankfully, the House of Representatives is not becoming the Senate."" Last week, six House
Democrats expressed their displeasure with the upper chamber by staging a sit-in of sorts on the Senate floor.
Seventy-six nominees for judgeships and executive posts have been approved by committees but, because of blocks,
haven't come up for a vote in the full Senate, leaving courtrooms idle and jobs unfilled across the upper levels of the
Obama Administration. (The Democrats also practiced the art of blocking nominees during the Bush Administration.)
There's often no objection to the individual being blocked: after an eight-month hold, Martha Johnson, nominated to run
the General Services Administration, was confirmed 96-0. On an issue like health-care reform, when the objection was
substantive, Republicans ransacked Riddick's ""Senate Procedure"" for every conceivable way to delay a debate and vote.
Judd Gregg even sent a memo on stalling tactics to his Republican colleagues. Tom Coburn demanded the reading aloud
of an entire seven-hundred-and-sixty-seven-page amendment proposed by Bernie Sanders, the Vermont socialist; Senate
clerks, working in half-hour shifts, were three hours into the chore when Sanders withdrew the amendment in frustration.
Under McConnell, Republicans have consistently consumed as much of the Senate's calendar as possible with legislative
maneuvering. The strategy is not to extend deliberation of the Senate's agenda but to prevent it. Tom Harkin, who first
proposed reform of the filibuster in 1995, called his Republican colleagues ""nihilists,"" who want to create chaos because it
serves their ideology. ""If there's chaos, things will tend toward simple solutions,"" Harkin said. ""In chaos people don't listen
to reason."" McConnell did not respond to requests for an interview, but he has often argued that the Republican strategy
reflects the views of a majority of Americans. In March, he told the Times, ""To the extent that they""—the Democrats—
""want to do things that we think are in the political center and would be helpful to the country, we'll be helpful. To the
extent they are trying to turn us into a Western European country, we are not going to be helpful.""
One of the mysteries of the Senate is how Mitch McConnell has been able to keep his members in line, on vote after vote.
Why do moderates with years of experience and their own power base back home—Richard Lugar, of Indiana; Susan
Collins, of Maine; George Voinovich, of Ohio—keep siding with the more extreme members of their caucus? Alexander
said that McConnell listens well to all his members, adding, ""When you have your back against the wall and the gallows
are hanging in front of you, it tends to unify. Operating with forty members—it concentrates the mind.""
Lindsey Graham described to the Times how McConnell exhorted his caucus after the disastrous 2008 election: ""He said
if we didn't stick together on big things, we wouldn't be relevant."" Last December, the Republicans decided to filibuster a
military-spending bill in order to delay the looming vote on health care until as close to Christmas as possible. Thad
Cochran, the Republican ranking member of the Appropriations Committee, promised Daniel Inouye, the chairman, that
he wouldn't join the effort. But at the last minute Cochran, who has been in the Senate since 1979 and brings
disproportionate amounts of defense money to Mississippi, told Reid that his leadership wouldn't allow him to vote with
the Democrats and end the filibuster—even on a matter of national security. (The Democrats were able to impose cloture,
and the vote on health care finally took place on Christmas Eve.)
Republican defections have been rare. In early 2009, Collins and Olympia Snowe, also of Maine, voted for the stimulus
bill, along with Arlen Specter (who promptly switched parties). Snowe also voted for the Finance Committee's health-care-
reform bill last October, the only Republican to do so. But in December, at the pivotal moment, she voted against the
version that went before the full Senate. ""I wasn't interested in expanding this program beyond the Finance Committee
version—it grew by a thousand pages,"" Snowe said. She wasn't included in the negotiations with White House officials
that took place in an elegant conference room across from Reid's suite of offices, and said that the Democrats ""did not
accept any of my proposals. As I said to the President, it was all windup and no pitch."" McConnell was able to exploit her
alienation. A friend of Snowe cited another reason for her reversal: ""She actually said to me once that she had never felt
the pressure that she felt on health care, never before had that pressure been quite as evident to her or quite as real or
troubling. Kyl and McConnell were saying things like 'You just can't let us down, we're all in this together. You're a senior
Republican member of this caucus, and you just have to hang tough with us. We expect it and you're going to do it.' ""
Reid doesn't use such tough tactics; he has achieved his position, in spite of his public shortcomings, by being the senator
who helped other Democrats, always answered their calls, and got them what they wanted through masterly
maneuvering. This has made him enormously popular within the Democratic caucus, but it doesn't give him the leverage
of McConnell, let alone of Lyndon Johnson.
In the current Senate, it has become normal for a handful of senators, sometimes representing just ten or twenty per cent
of the country's population, to hold everything up. And the status quo has become sufficiently frustrating that a few new
senators have considered a radical option: mutiny.
Tom Udall, who is sixty-two, is older than most freshman senators. He has the crow's-feet of a Westerner who has spent
time in the sun, and a slow, good-natured voice. His father, Stewart, was an Arizona congressman and the Interior
Secretary for Presidents Kennedy and Johnson; his uncle Mo was a legendary Arizona representative; his cousin Mark is
a freshman senator from Colorado. Udall served five terms in the House before winning a Senate seat from New Mexico,
in 2008. And yet he has the air of a political Candide—he is always earnest, capable of disappointment but not cynicism.
""I ran on the idea that the Senate should not be a graveyard for good ideas,"" he said. ""Then to be on the inside—the thing
that strikes you is how one senator can hold up the whole show.""
In his first year in office, Udall decided to do something audacious: he would try to change the Senate's rules.
Customarily, the rules continue session after session, and a provision in Rule XXII requires sixty-seven votes to amend
them, making it extremely difficult. (""Rule XXII is a Catch-22,"" Ted Kennedy used to joke.) Udall embraced a different
idea—the ""constitutional option."" Article I, Section 5 of the Constitution states that ""each House may determine the Rules
of its Proceedings"" at the beginning of the new Congress. So, in theory, a senator could take the floor next January and
propose debating its rules from scratch, including the filibuster. New rules could be passed with a simple majority. There's
even a precedent for this: moves to revisit the rules by invoking the constitutional option have been made three times,
most recently in 1975. Udall has spent much of the past year trying to build support for the idea.
At the request of Udall and others, Schumer, who is the chairman of the Rules Committee, has held a series of hearings
on the filibuster, calling witnesses such as Sarah Binder, the historian, and Walter Mondale, who was in the Senate when
the constitutional option was invoked in 1975. Dick Durbin, the second-highest-ranking Democrat, has organized working
groups among newer members on other internal reforms, such as ending secret holds and choosing committee chairs by
caucus vote rather than by seniority. (Lamar Alexander wryly suggested to me that Schumer and Durbin were competing
for the favor of newer members, in case Harry Reid loses his seat in the fall and they run against each other for Majority
Leader.)
For Republican institutionalists, such as Alexander and Gregg, the push for rules reform is folly. ""If you want a
parliamentary form of government, go over to the House,"" Gregg, who is about to retire, scoffed. ""Why even run for the
Senate?"" Udall's plan for next January, he said, would be a ""gigantic mistake.""
""They'll get over it,"" Alexander said of the Democrats' enthusiasm for rules reform. ""And they'll get over it quicker if they're
in the minority next January. Because they'll instantly see the value of slowing the Senate down to consider whatever they
have to say."" He added that the Senate ""may be getting done about as much as the American people want done."" The
President's ambitious agenda, after all, has upset a lot of voters, across the political spectrum. None of the Republicans I
spoke to agreed with the contention that the Senate is ""broken."" Alexander claimed that he and other Republicans were
exercising the moderating, thoughtful influence on legislation that the founders wanted in the Senate. ""The Senate wasn't
created to be efficient,"" he argued. ""It was created to be inefficient."" At one of the filibuster hearings, in April, Alexander,
sitting across the table from Udall, said that, for all the times the Democrats charge the Republicans with obstructing
legislation, ""we could say that's the number of times the majority has tried to cut off our right to debate, our right to offer
amendments, which is the essence of the Senate.""
Newcomers like Udall seem to think that the Senate has grown so absurd and extreme that some kind of reform is
inevitable. Perhaps they need more time to plumb the depths of the institution's intransigence. According to Sarah Binder,
a change in rules is extremely unlikely; Republicans would be implacably opposed to, say, weakening the filibuster, and
so would some Democrats, especially long-serving ones. ""I would oppose that,"" Chris Dodd said, adding of the freshmen,
""These are people who have never been in the minority."" For older Democrats, who have put in their years, grown adept
at working the rules, and now chair powerful committees, the reform impulse could be a threat. (Among senior senators,
the sole enthusiast for rules reform is Tom Harkin.) One senator spoke of the Senate as being divided not between
whales and minnows but, rather, between bulls and calves. The older Democrats are too accustomed to the Senate's
ways to share the frustrations of the newcomers; the handful of older moderate Republicans are too weak to challenge the
newer radicals who now dominate the caucus.
Even if the freshmen Democrats can somehow reform the filibuster next January, the Senate will remain a sclerotic,
wasteful, unhappy body. The deepest source of its problems is not rules and precedents but, rather, its human beings,
who have created a culture where Tocqueville's ""lofty thoughts"" and ""generous impulses"" have no place.
A few days after passing health-care reform, the Senate struggled to its feet to take on a second large task. Financial
regulatory reform should have been the easiest piece of major legislation of the Obama Presidency, the likeliest to win
real bipartisan support. The financial crisis had been catastrophic for millions of Americans, and after the 2008 bailout
Wall Street had become even more hated than the Senate was. In April, a lineup of bankers from Goldman Sachs
appeared before Senator Levin's subcommittee on investigations, and managed to appear as arrogant, callous, and
evasive as their reputations had suggested. The public demanded action. Some Republicans had a genuine desire to
pass a bill. If health-care reform had been a war of attrition, financial reform was a promising liaison.
The affair began with a Republican, Bob Corker, and a Democrat, Mark Warner—both multimillionaires serving their first
term, both considered centrists. Corker is a small, dapper former construction magnate who became the mayor of
Chattanooga; Warner is a tall, preppily dressed former telecommunications entrepreneur who became the governor of
Virginia. Chris Dodd, the Banking Committee chairman, assigned them to work together on the section of the bill having to
do with the liquidation of troubled firms—making sure that there would never be another taxpayer bailout. They worked
through the winter, in Warner's office, in Corker's office, over dinner, sometimes without staff, as if they were members of
a Senate from the past. They hosted a series of afternoon seminars, inviting guests such as Ben Bernanke, Alan
Greenspan, and Sheila Bair. Corker and Warner were sometimes said to be the only Democrat and Republican still
talking to each other. In January, Business Week called them the Senate's ""Odd Couple."" By February, they had finished
their work.
Meanwhile, discussions about the entire bill between Dodd and Richard Shelby, the top Republican on the committee,
dragged on, repeatedly breaking down. Finally, on February 10th, Dodd called Corker, who, though he was one of the
committee's junior members, agreed to be the chairman's Republican negotiating partner. When Corker informed
McConnell and Shelby, they expressed surprise. ""It was an odd place to be,"" Corker recalled. ""And yet that night we
began meeting."" The junior Republican savored the rare experience of creating, rather than opposing, legislation. In
response, Shelby's conservative staff tried to undermine Corker, spreading rumors among Republicans and their lobbyists
that he was giving too much away. (A Shelby aide said that staff members were simply informing other Republicans of the
Party's line on financial reform.)
On March 10th, Dodd concluded that he had to move a bill to the floor. He called Corker and said, ""You've been a great
partner."" He was ending their talks after only a month. ""It's a little stunning, I've got to be honest,"" Corker told reporters
afterward. Someone close to the negotiations compared Corker to Dickens's Miss Havisham, unable to get over the
rebuff, forever awaiting the arrival of her groom, all her clocks stopped. Corker later said that Dodd had ended the talks
under pressure from the White House and other Democrats. Dodd said that Corker had been unable to bring any other
Republicans with him. ""Baloney,"" Corker said. ""If Dodd had reached an agreement with me, we'd've had at least twenty-
five Republican votes.""
The bill that Dodd brought before the Senate, after a year of discussions with Democrats and Republicans alike,
incorporated the bipartisan plan of Warner and Corker to prevent another bank bailout: setting up a fifty-billion-dollar fund,
paid for by the banks, to insure orderly liquidation, and establishing a risk council to detect warning signs of another crisis.
But in mid-April Mitch McConnell—who had just met with Wall Street executives in New York, and was now parroting
talking points from a memo written by the Republican strategist Frank Luntz—called it a ""partisan bill"" that ""will guarantee
perpetual taxpayer bailout of Wall Street banks."" McConnell presented a letter, signed by all forty-one Republicans,
suggesting that they would filibuster the financial-reform bill.
His remarks amounted to a repudiation of Corker's work as well as of Dodd's. The next day, April 15th, Corker pleaded
with his colleagues, in his Tennessee twang, ""Let's come to the floor and let's act like adults. Let's tone down the rhetoric.
Let's don't exaggerate the pluses or minuses. Let's do what the Senate was created to do. . . . We were supposed to be
the people that took some of the red-hot activities that sometimes come from the other body and sat down with cooler
heads and resolved the issues like adults. We can do that. As a matter of fact, I would say, if we cannot do that on
financial regulation, an issue that really doesn't have any real philosophical bearings to it . . ."" Corker didn't allow the
thought to ripen—he had already gone farther than almost any Republican would have dared.
Dodd spoke later in the day and completed Corker's speech: ""I know my friends on the other side of the aisle are faced
with a difficult choice between supporting their party leadership and participating in this complicated, difficult debate. I am
not naïve. I know that is a hard place to be. But if we can't act like U.S. senators for the sake of this issue . . . then why
are we even here?"" He went on, ""We work for an American public that is sick and tired of feeling like no one is looking out
for their interests, like the political hacks and lobbyists hold all the cards in these discussions. The minority seems intent
on proving them right. . . . I have been here a long time. I know this institution is better than that. I know there are friends
of mine on the other side of the aisle who care about this bill, who want to be a part of the debate, who want to be part of
the solution.""
In the same speech, Dodd joined the partisan fight, accusing McConnell of lying about the bill. Turning crimson-faced, he
chopped the air with his hand as he shouted, ""I have to ask myself, why did I go through this process over the last four or
five months, agreeing to much of what they were offering, and there is not a single political vote to show for it. . . . I have
to say to the younger members, the newer members coming along: be careful!""
Corker, having heard that Dodd was speaking, returned to the chamber and asked to respond. ""You and I went a long
way,"" Corker told Dodd. ""Then we stopped. On March 10th it ended. I understand that, look, you were losing Democrats
on your committee.""
""And I was not gaining Republicans,"" Dodd replied.
""You had one, and that is all you asked for when you started. I never said I could speak for anybody but myself. And I did
not leave the table."" Corker urged Dodd to keep talking to Republicans—their differences could be sorted out in a few
days.
But this was not McConnell's agenda. Instead, financial reform became a slightly more polite repeat of the health-care-
reform brawl: the Republicans threatened filibusters, the Democrats threatened all-nighters, and thousands of lobbyists
prowled the Capitol, charging their Wall Street clients more than a billion dollars. On April 28th, I was sitting in the ornate
Reception Room with Jim Manley, Reid's spokesman. On the other side of the wall, there was the noise of furniture
scraping across a tile floor. ""Those are cots being set up in the L.B.J. Room,"" Manley said. ""Very little happens around
here without a deadline."" The cots persuaded Republicans to allow the bill to move to the floor for debate. A few weeks
later, on May 20th, yet another filibuster was defeated by yet another cloture motion, and financial reform finally came to a
vote. It passed, 59-39. Only four Republicans had joined the majority. Corker wasn't among them. He had even voted for
an amendment, offered by his Republican colleague Jeff Sessions, of Alabama, that would have scrapped Corker's work
of many months with Warner.
""The idea of watching Bob Corker vote for the Sessions amendment!"" Dodd said afterward, sitting in his red-curtained
office, under a print of Holbein's portrait of Thomas More. ""It's the Senate, I guess."" McConnell's strategy of obstruction
had once again come close to succeeding, Dodd said, but he knew that a ""shrinking number"" of Republicans were
frustrated. The previous day, Dodd had said to Susan Collins, ""God, I would have loved to have you as my ranking
member on this."" Collins responded, ""We could have had such a great time on this bill.""
Warner, who said that he believed in bipartisanship because ""the American people don't trust either political party enough
to give them a blank check,"" was astonished that so few Republicans voted for financial reform. ""There was zero
substantive reason why this couldn't have been eighty votes,"" he said. I asked him why Bob Corker had voted no on the
bill. Warner started to talk about the consumer-protection title, and then said, ""If you want to vote against something, you
can always find your reasons.""
But Corker hadn't seemed to want to vote against it. He had spent months trying to act like a U.S. senator, alienating
himself from his own party and then the other party, and on the day of the vote he held the floor for the better part of thirty
minutes, as if he were still reluctant to let the effort go. ""I am obviously disappointed,"" he said. ""I think I have spent as
much time as any senator. . . on policy regarding our financial system. I think any bill—even this bill—has good things in
it. There is no question. And I appreciate the thrust. But I think there is a lot of overreaching, and I think not enough time
was spent on some of the core issues.""
As the senators cast their votes, I noticed Robert Kaiser, the author of ""So Damn Much Money,"" in the press gallery. I later
asked him if, with the passage of two big reform bills in three months, we were witnessing a possible renewal of the
Senate. ""If you can engage public opinion in a way politicians can understand, public opinion can still blow away money
and interest groups,"" he said. ""But over the past few decades the reflex has grown in the Senate that, all things
considered, it's better to avoid than to take on big issues. This is the kind of thing that drives Michael Bennet nutty: here
you've arrived in the United States Senate and you can't do fuck-all about the destruction of the planet.""
After the final vote on financial reform, the Republicans flew home, and the Democratic leaders held a press conference,
smiling before the microphones outside the Senate chamber. Reid said, ""For those who wanted to protect Wall Street, it
didn't work."" He then excused himself: he had to join Biden for a telephone fund-raiser with ""some Nevadans.""
Durbin said, ""I was stunned that only four Republicans would join us in passing this historic legislation. What does it take
to bring the Republican Party into the conversation about the future of America?""
Dodd, glowing with triumph, said, ""I wanted to demonstrate that the Senate of the United States could conduct its
business much as our founders intended. We did that.""
On July 21st, President Obama signed the completed bill. The two lasting achievements of this Senate, financial
regulation and health care, required a year and a half of legislative warfare that nearly destroyed the body. They
depended on a set of circumstances—a large majority of Democrats, a charismatic President with an electoral mandate,
and a national crisis—that will not last long or be repeated anytime soon. Two days after financial reform became law,
Harry Reid announced that the Senate would not take up comprehensive energy-reform legislation for the rest of the year.
And so climate change joined immigration, job creation, food safety, pilot training, veterans' care, campaign finance,
transportation security, labor law, mine safety, wildfire management, and scores of executive and judicial appointments on
the list of matters that the world's greatest deliberative body is incapable of addressing. Already, you can feel the Senate
slipping back into stagnant waters.

USUN PRESS RELEASE #157 August
2, 2010
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Statement by Ambassador Susan E. Rice, U.S. Permanent Representative to the United Nations, on Secretary
General Ban's Panel Concerning the May 31 Flotilla Incident
The United States welcomes today's announcement by UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon of the
establishment of a Panel regarding the incident of May 31st- We thank both governments for the constructive
and cooperative spirit they have shown and the Secretary General for his leadership and determination. The
Panel, which has the support of both Israel and Turkey, will receive and review the reports of each
government's national investigation into the incident and make recommendations as to how to avoid such
incidents in the future. This Panel is not a substitute for those national investigations. It complements them,
affording Israel and Turkey the opportunity to present the conclusions of their investigations to the international
community. The focus of the Panel is appropriately on the future and on preventing such incidents from
recurring. The United States also hopes that the Panel can serve as a vehicle to enable Israel and Turkey to
move beyond the recent strains in their relationship and repair their strong historic ties.
The United States expects that the Panel will operate in a transparent and credible manner and that its work will

Special Envoy Mitchell emphasized the importance of making progress in the proximity talks and of moving to direct
negotiations as soon as possible. We have received commitments from both sides, and we have made assurances to
both sides, that are enabling us to move forward. The full scope of these discussions will remain private.

1.Closing Wrap-up Video from Forum (produced by IIP and huge hit)
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZ8kpXbql1c
2.Thank-you Letter from Cameroon Delegate to Embassy
Dear All,
Good morning from Washington DC. I trust that we are keeping well. I just want to use this opportunity to say that today
we come to the end of the program here on the President's Forum. All along this Forum and especially during the White
House meeting with President Obama, I have been asking myself what it means to be here in DC and to be representing
Cameroon at this forum?
I have recently come to the realization that the time is critical and that President Obama in his thinking about a new
Africa believes that young people whom we are, diverse and intelligently different can take little positive actions to
ensure that the next 50 years witnesses significant changes in our social processes, our political institutions, processes
and structures, our economic freedom, taking into consideration our cultural specificities.
While traveling to America, I kept imagining the moment when President Obama would tell us great and magical ways to
getting out of our current socio-economic and especially political hostage situations, but in all and after all the speeches,
conversations and interactions with Ordinary Americans like in the Southside of Washington DC, State Department Staff,
Senators, Secretary of State Clinton and President Obama, I noticed that America can only partner with us when we
decide to start thinking and acting differently in our quest for a better Cameroon and a better Africa.
This thinking differently is exemplified by the American Peace Corps, in the service leadership, the spirit of give back to
the nation and community and the transformation of challenges to opportunities in America and in many nations
around the world...
When our troubles and challenges seems gruesome and our vision blurred by the thought and fear of the unknown if we
dared, the one thing I come out with from this Forum is this, ""That we just have to Think, Speak out and above all, DARE
take some innovative ACTIONs to Be the change we want to see in our communities, nations and continent and commit
others to same by our examples...That we have to build strong networks and undertake advocacies as a group as
nothing has ever stopped a committed group of people to drive change aound the world.
The work to be done is enormous and challenging but sure the reward of every success like coming to America, to the
White House and meeting with President Obama is sweet. Therefore I come back to work to be the change I want to see
in Cameroon.
I thank you all for the opportunity.","['Cameroon', 'Washington', 'DC', 'White', 'House', 'DC', 'Cameroon', 'Africa', 'America', 'Southside', 'Washington', 'DC', 'America', 'Cameroon', 'Africa', 'America', 'America', 'Cameroon']"

H: All still in play, by end of Monday. Sid
Gordon was convinced he had to sacrifice himself for any attempt to form a grand progressive coalition with the Lib-Dems.
Clegg had said during the campaign he would not deal with Gordon and he remained adamant. Peter, Alastair, Ed Balls,
and Ed Miliband met secretly with the LD team on Sunday. Gordon decided to fall on his sword today. The negotiations
between Labour and the LDs now are engaged with the same teams. The Tories at the same time also are negotiating.
Both offer competing plans for electoral reform that would give the LDs more representation in the future. If the LDs strike
a deal with the Tories Labour is unlikely to support it and campaign against that referendum. Cameron is strained right
now. His right does not approve of a deal while others push him to make an arrangement in order to attain power.
Cameron may be limited in how far he can go in his offer. But by no means is a Labour-LD deal certain or even probable,
even given Gordon's political suicide. The campaign for leader to replace Gordon begins as soon as the Labour-LD
negotiations are concluded. David is ready to go; he will face Ed Balls and possibly his brother Ed. If there is a coalition
that would tilt against Balls, who is seen as Gordon's heir and as an inappropriate PM, Gordon redux, to work with the
LDs. One of the Milibands will emerge. I still bet on David. So four days after the election, everything is still in play. Sid",[]

Mike
Richard Momoima Onyonka is a Kenyan politician and belongs to the People's Democratic Party. Born in 1962 and
hailing from the Bogeka clan, VM Momoima has lived in Otamba, Nyamataro, Mosocho and Nairobi. In 1982, following
the failed Kenyan coup d'etat attempt to overthrow President Daniel Arap Moi's government, VM Momoima was among
the 900 people that were jailed. However, in 1984, he returned to the University of Nairobi and graduated with a
Bachelors degree in commerce a year later. After graduation, VM Momoima attended North Carolina State University
where he graduated with a Masters degree in management. He returned to Kenya in 1992 during the first multi party
elections to help his father (then incumbent MP for Kitutu Chache and Minister for Planning and National Development)
who was seeking re-election on a KANU (Kenya African National Union) ticket. VM Momoima's first political opportunity
arose when his father passed away in 1996, which prompted an election in which he lost to a new corner during the
party (KANU) nominations. Since the Kenyan parliamentary election in 2007, VM Momoima has represented the Kitutu
Chache Constituency in the National Assembly of Kenya.
A financial economist by profession, VM Momoima currently runs personal businesses in Nairobi and Kisii and has held
positions in the Kisii KANU branch. His priorities include economic empowerment, particularly for youth and women,
education, and poverty reduction.

BY VALERIE M. HUDSON, PATRICIA LEIDL I MAY 10, 2010
One day in November 2009, in Helmand province's capital of Lashkar Gah, a group of Afghan widows and divorcees met
with Patricia, who had been commissioned to write a series of success stories for the U.S. Agency for International
Development (USAID). All the women were in their 20s, 30s, and 40s but looked to be in their 60s. Until very recently,
none of them could work because they possessed no marketable skills, could neither read nor write, and were at risk of
being killed if they left their homes. A number of women said that, before the program -- which focused on tailoring and
basic literacy -- their children used to weep at night from hunger.

As Patricia prepared to leave, the women fluttered around her like moths, touching her sleeves and speaking all at once.
'What are they saying?"" Pat asked the young Pashto-speaking interpreter. ""They are telling you to go back to your
country and to ask your people not to abandon them. The women of Afghanistan don't want you to leave. They will quite
literally die if the Taliban return,"" she said.
In a recent question-and-answer period at one of our universities, Brigham Young, a student asked Gen. David Petraeus
whether anyone thought to ask the women of Afghanistan how they felt about U.S. hopes to incorporate ""reformed""
Taliban into governance structures as the Americans leave.
Carefully avoiding the word ""women,"" the general assured the questioning student that only ""moderate"" Taliban would be
eligible for such rehabilitation. Left unaddressed was the definition of ""moderate,"" which clearly depends on where you sit:
If you sit in a burqa, there is no such thing as a ""moderate"" Taliban.
Petraeus might find it easy now to sidestep the question of what will happen to Afghanistan's women once the ""moderate""
Taliban come back, but it's likely to haunt him for a long time. Without the security of women there is no security -- and
until we've done more to protect it, we have a moral and practical obligation to stay in Afghanistan.
In 2001, George W. Bush's administration interpreted the first post-invasion photos of Afghan girls heading to school and
of Afghan women unveiling their faces as tangible evidence that conditions were improving in that benighted land. A few
months after the invasion, in his 2002 State of the Union address, Bush announced, ""The last time we met in this
chamber, the mothers and daughters of Afghanistan were captives in their own homes, forbidden from working or going to
school. Today women are free and are part of Afghanistan's new government.""
The Americans strong-armed a handful of women into the loya jirga that then drafted the Afghan Constitution. They
strong-armed a quota for women in the Afghan national legislature -- something that even American women are not
treated to. U.S. troops built schools for girls and pushed for women to be included in the local shuras, and USAID ripped a
page from Greg Mortenson's Three Cups of Tea and facilitated new training and educational opportunities for women.
But the current administration, despite its female secretary of State and its new Office of Global Women's Issues, appears
to be ditching the women of Afghanistan like a blind date gone bad. You have to go back 10 months to find any sustained
rhetoric from President Barack Obama about the importance of assuring the security of women in Afghanistan. Since
then, and especially since last year's Afghan election, those fine words from a sitting president have all but disappeared.
Many of the fine actions are gone, too. Push local shuras into including women in 2002? Yes. Push local shuras into
including women in 2010? Forget it.
It's not difficult to understand why. Afghanistan is in crisis. The cynical policies that characterized the early to mid-stages
of the occupation have come home to roost. President Hamid Karzai and his rogue's gallery of kleptocrats, human rights
abusers, and drug lords are hanging onto power even as Karzai declares open season on the United Nations by accusing
senior bureaucrats of organizing the widespread voter fraud that consolidated his own hold on power.
In the meantime, women have taken a back seat to realpolitik and the exigencies of a coalition exit strategy. But their
suffering is real, as Afghanistan's poverty and chaos affect women possibly most of all. Matemal mortality in Afghanistan
still makes the world's top three list, nine years after the U.S. invasion, resulting in a life expectancy for women of 46. In
the countryside, Taliban zealots spray acid into girls' faces for going to school -- and only 27 percent of them do so in the
first place. According to a recent survey by the U.N. Development Fund for Women, 87 percent of Afghan women report
being beaten on a regular basis.
In July of last year, the U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) issued a report that represents the most stinging
official condemnation of the Karzai administration's abysmal track record on women to date. The report concluded, ""The
current reality is that ... women are denied their most fundamental human rights and risk further violence in the course of
seeking justice for crimes perpetrated against them."" Last year Karzai pardoned well-connected political thugs who --
before witnesses -- gang-raped a woman with a bayonet. Her husband, who had battled for redress, was assassinated
soon thereafter. Women who dare to speak out against the widespread trampling of their rights face almost certain death
while their murderers face 100 percent impunity.
For the warlords and mujahideen that make up the upper echelons of the Karzai government, the issue of gender equality
was always an unwanted appendage to U.S. involvement -- but one that could easily be dispensed with through the
deployment of flowery speeches and the token appointment of a lone female minister to the Ministry of Women's Affairs.
Indeed, just before his recent ""election,"" Karzai felt secure enough to sign into law a series of repressive measures
designed to repeal what minimal gains women have made since the Taliban ouster.
Although eventually forced to back down over legislation that allows Shiite husbands to rape their wives, Karzai
successfully signed into law other legislation that denies or severely limits women's rights to inherit, divorce, or have
guardianship of their own children. The Shiite Personal Status Law also legalizes forced marriage and the rape of minors.
It allows men to exert almost total control over female relatives and offers them the power to prohibit women's access to
work, education, and health care by denying them the right to leave their homes except for ""legitimate"" purposes. Even
Karzai's own wife -- a doctor whose skills are desperately needed -- is strictly sequestered. And if this sounds bad, just
wait until the Americans leave.
This is not just about women. Gender inequality not only affects girls and women, but boys and men. In Afghanistan,
because women are rarely able to leave the house, very young boys are often forced to carry an unwarranted amount of
financial responsibility, something that limits their prospects as well.
Nor is it even just about Afghanistan. As Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said in March, ""The subjugation of women is a
threat to the national security of the United States."" On a geopolitical level, Valerie's research has found that states with
higher levels of violence against women are also less peaceful internationally. Indeed, violence against women is a better
predictor of bellicosity than level of democracy, level of wealth, or presence of Islamic civilization. In a 2010 study, Valerie,
along with Brad Thayer, also found high levels of gender inequality to be a strong aggravating factor in the development of
Islamic suicide terrorism.
So, given the desperate need of Afghanistan's women and the serious consequences worldwide, why aren't we doing
more to help? One reason is the fallacious notion, common among coalition members, that Afghan ""culture"" does not
allow for gender equality and that forcing the issue will undermine Western interests. Pat heard this openly from one
coalition representative, who prefers to remain anonymous: 'There is no point in pushing gender equality. It will only
alienate them [Afghans]."" Of course, ""them"" here refers only to men.
But decision-makers forget that culture is not fixed, but is highly mutable and dynamic. More than 30 years ago, Afghan
women were attending universities, teaching, working as doctors, nurses, and professors. Far from being a black hole of
gender apartheid, Afghanistan, though impoverished, was more progressive than many of its Muslim neighbors.
Furthermore, many young Afghans are open to new ways of doing things. In 2009, hundreds of Afghan men and women
bravely stood together in Kabul to protest Karzai's support for a new and oppressive Shiite family law. If Americans
assume that all Afghan men are Neanderthals incapable of sympathizing with the plight of their sisters, they are wrong.
Another, more unmentionable reason may be the chauvinism that permeates Western military culture. U.S. military life,
despite increasing female recruitment and even ""female engagement teams,"" remains a bastion of masculinity, with little
sensitivity toward questions of female rights. For military leadership and recruits alike, immured as they are in an almost
exclusively male world, the complete absence of women from Afghanistan's streets and villages elicited no comment from
the Marines who surrounded Pat, though she as a woman noticed it immediately.
And the ready availability of pornography on U.S. bases, coupled with seamier depictions of life in the West, not only
damages prospects for gender equality but by extension, Western interests. As one young, well-educated 24-year-old
Afghan male pointed out, ""Your culture has no respect for women at all. Look at your pornography and the way you exploit
women in ways that we can't even imagine. Do you call that progress?"" Added another Afghan USAID programmer
working in Gardez, a man in his 50s who is the father of three girls, ""It would be better for the coalition if they could figure
out a way to limit this kind of material.""
We can do better -- much better.
The Obama administration must instill in all military personnel and senior diplomats the necessity of fully protecting
women's rights. Key to that is educating them about how gender equality furthers Western interests and security.
The military should spend less time courting ""moderate"" Taliban and more time showing Afghan community leaders how
gender equality -- including female access to family planning methods -- will result in healthier families, lower maternal
and child death rates, poverty alleviation, and greater self-determination. Gender should be included as a component in all
governance training and should be placed front and center in the upcoming ""peace jirga"" that will include the Taliban.
Indeed, let half of the negotiating team representing the government and the coalition be female: yes, a full 50 percent.
Women must also be represented in the government. As Melanne Verveer, U.S. ambassador at large for global women's
issues, noted last summer, speaking of female politicians in Afghanistan, ""There is only one minister in the cabinet, and
she is powerless. There is a low percentage of women in the civil service. There is only one female governor, in
Bamiyan."" Obama must insist on important changes for women before we leave and make subsequent aid contingent
upon maintenance of a strong presence for women in the Afghan government.
Better yet, the coalition needs to support ""regime change"" through the building of democratic institutions that will groom a
moderate, educated middle class of young women and men to eventually take over. Over two-thirds of the Afghan
population is under the age of 25, which is either a real opportunity for social change -- if they are educated and given a
chance to shape their society in a progressive way -- or a major obstacle, if they find themselves without jobs, unable to
marry, and burdened with retrograde attitudes of what it means to be male and female.
We must hold Afghanistan responsible for its treaty obligations under the U.N. Convention on the Elimination of
Discrimination against Women (CEDAVV) and U.N. Security Council Resolution 1325 on women, peace, and
security. Afghanistan signed CEDAW without reservations (the United States interestingly, has not), and that means that it
has committed to passing whatever legislation is necessary to implement the wide-ranging principles of gender equality
enshrined in that treaty. This includes taking measures to ensure that women enjoy the same basic human rights and
fundamental freedoms as men, having in place legal and judicial procedures to protect the rights of women, taking
measures to eliminate sexist discrimination, and lastly, submitting national reports every four years to a U.N. advisory
group of international experts, the CEDAW Committee, to ensure transparency on what measures the country has taken
to implement the treaty's provisions.
Unanimously adopted in 2000, UNSC 1325 marked the first time the Security Council recognized the disproportionate and
unique impact of armed conflict on women and stressed the importance of their equal and full participation as active
agents in peace and security.
Needless to say, women do not currently enjoy the same fundamental freedoms as men, and indeed, with the passing of
the Shiite family law, many are worse off than they were before.
To change this, the coalition needs to stay in Afghanistan. Withdrawing at this critical juncture would doom Afghanistan
and the entire region to instability and effectively consign one half of the population to premature death and an existence
not fit for animals.
We are creating a shameful American tradition of leaving women no better off (Afghanistan) -- or even much worse off
(Iraq) -- than before U.S. troops intervened. On the basis of America's track record, women around the world should have
no faith that U.S. soldiers will improve their security. Despite Clinton's remarks on the link between gender equality and
security, on the ground Americans act as if women's well-being, in the end, is not more than peripherally related to the
issue of peace. As we have seen, this view could not be more wrong. Verveer's benchmarks concerning Afghanistan are
the right ones: ""Progress in Afghanistan must be measured not just in military terms, but also in terms of social, political,
and economic participation of women in rebuilding Afghanistan and in the safeguarding of their human rights.""
American women are right to ask why we are sending their sons and daughters to fight and die so that Afghan women can
continue to be treated like an inferior subspecies of humanity. When you break faith with Afghan women, you break faith
with American women. You also break faith with your reasons for being there in the first place.

5543,"Under-Skin Defibrillators Seen Closer to Reality
By BARRY MEIER
The likelihood that patients in the United States may some day receive heart defibrillators that can operate without
electrical wires connected to their hearts has moved a step closer, according to a study published Wednesday.
The development of the new type of defibrillator has been long pursued by a researcher, Dr. Gust H. Bardy, at the Seattle
Institute for Cardiac Research in Seattle. And in the study in The New England Journal of Medicine, Dr. Bardy and other
researchers reported that initial trials of such a device in patients were successful.
Defibrillators fire an electrical jolt to interrupt a potentially fatal heart rhythm and restore normal beating. For a unit to
function, a surgeon must thread an electrical sensing wire through a blood vessel into a patient's heart. The wires pose
risks because they can, on rare occasion, puncture the heart during implantation or fracture while in place.
The new version delivers the electrical jolt by means of a sensor implanted under the skin near the chest bone. A power
unit is placed under the skin on the side of the chest.
The new device is already for sale in some European countries, but Dr. Bardy and others cautioned that full-scale, long-
term trials were still needed to prove the implant's worth to the Food and Drug Administration. Even if successful, the
unit could not be used by all patients who needed a defibrillator, but several researchers said they were excited by the new
study nonetheless.
Dr. Douglas P. Zipes, a professor at the Indiana University School of Medicine in Indianapolis, said the new device could
someday displace existing models used in many patients Every month, about 10,000 patients in this country get a
defibrillator, either for the first time or as replacements for devices whose batteries have worn out.
In recent years, the safety of defibrillator wires has come in particular focus because a model made by Medtronic has been
prone to fracturing. Hundreds of patients who received the model have had to undergo new operations to replace it. Also,
scar tissue often builds up around intravenous wires, a process that can make removing and replacing them difficult or
dangerous.
Dr. Bardy said in a telephone interview that the deaths of several patients many years ago because of wire-related injuries
were a factor in his interest in developing the new device.
""You are looking at a therapy that can avert, we hope, complications and be as effective,"" he said.
In the study published Wednesday, Dr. Bardy and others reported that the new device had undergone several successful
initial trials, including one in which it was used for a year in about 60 patients.
The device is being developed by Cameron Health, a small company in San Clemente, Calif., that was co-founded by Dr.
Bardy. Since the cardiologist began work on the project about a decade ago, the defibrillator he helped design has gone
through several iterations.
The device will not be suitable for a significant number of heart patients, particularly those who require units that also
include a pacemaker, which regulates a heart that is beating too fast or too slowly.
But Dr. Bardy estimated that the device could work in about 25 percent of patients who now get a defibrillator. These are
largely patients at risk, because of genetic factors or certain types of heart diseases, for a type of erratic cardiac rhythm
that can cause sudden death. Dr. Bardy said the cost of the new device is about the same as a standard defibrillator.
However, he said it could help reduce health care costs, because implanting it is much simpler.
Before the device can be sold here, Cameron Health will have to submit more extensive human trial data to theF.D.A.. Dr.
Bardy said a larger study of the device has just begun in this country and overseas and that it will most likely take a year or
more to assemble data from it for the agency's review.","['United', 'States', 'Seattle', 'Indianapolis', 'San', 'Clemente', 'Calif.']"
5544,"H: Very good analysis of Iran from Gary Sick, I think. SidAugust 8, 2010
Gary Sick
America and Iran: Strikes, Sanctions and Scapegoats
For the pundits, there are only two questions about U.S.-Iran relations that are of any importance: (1) Will Israel
and/or the United States attack Iran? and (2) will the new sanctions have enough bite to persuade Iran to change
its nuclear policy? Despite all the printers ink spilled on these two issues, the answers are an easy no and no.
Neither the United States nor Israel will take the military option off the table, thereby giving the pundits (and the
crowd that is dying to repeat Iraq) latitude to keep the distant prospect of military action on the front pages,
where it has been for years. As a lede, it sells columns and newspapers, so it will not go away. But as analysis it
is either blinded by the momentary hype or else is simple wish fulfillment.
Uber-neocon John Bolton had it right. If any such attack were to occur, it would have been at the end of the Bush
administration when there was nothing left to lose. Bolton thought it was so inevitable that he predicted it
unequivocally in a Wall Street Journal column in 2008. Dick Cheney apparently agreed, judging from his
subsequent statements of regret. So it is fair to say that George W. Bush, after looking the potential
consequences, resisted the advice of his neocon advisers, his previously dominant vice president, and the
reported direct request from the government of Israel — and rejected a strike. What is the likelihood that Barack
Obama, with the same catastrophic scenario before him, will approve? Forget it.
Sanctions do not persuade dictatorial regimes to abandon projects that they think are central to their security
and survival or even their self-image. Just look at Saddam Hussein. The international sanctions imposed on Iraq
in the 1980s make the current Iran sanctions appear anemic in comparison. Every item that went in and out of
Iraq was subject to approval by a UN committee dominated by a vindictive United States. Yet, although Iraq had
abandoned its nuclear weapons program years earlier, Saddam could not bring himself to let his own people and
his enemies know that. Instead he was prepared to gamble that the United States would not attack him.
One of the reasons for this bad bet was that he and his cronies were doing so well under the sanctions that there
was no immediate necessity to come clean. They, after all, controlled the smuggling routes. And their henchmen
managed the thriving and enormously lucrative black market. As for concern with their own people, a rotund
Tariq Aziz, sitting with a fine Scotch and a Cuban cigar, informed a worried UN representative that it would be
good for the Iraqi people to lose some weight. An Iraqi friend of mine told me at the time that the sanctions had
made criminals of the entire Iraqi middle class, which had to resort to illegal behavior in order to survive. The
biggest – and most successful – of this new criminal class was the privileged group immediately around Saddam
Hussein.
Which brings us to Iran. The sanctions are more effective than many anticipated. They have built a web of
financial restrictions and limitations around the already weak Iranian economy that is certain to cause significant
problems for the leadership. Iran's critical energy sector is particularly vulnerable. It is in a pincer. Because of
cheap energy prices inside the country, artificially propped up by massive subsidies, energy demand is soaring.
This siphons off a lot of Iran's oil production, which would otherwise be sold on the world market for hard
currency.
At the same time, because Iran's oil fields are old and complex, they require modern technology to maintain
production. That technology – and the capital investment that can only be provided by the major international oil
companies – has been absent for many years. It was driven away partly by the sanctions, ironically assisted by
Iran's own short-sighted negotiating tactics that offered only the most meager profit margins to outside
investors. As a result, Iran's oil production is in decline at the same time that more and more of it is being soaked
up by domestic consumption. In a period of relatively low oil prices, this means that Iran's hard currency
earnings are drying up at an alarming rate.
This unenviable economic situation is compounded by what has to be described as perhaps the least competent
economic management team of any major country in the world. Ayatollah Khamene'i, the Supreme Leader,
seems totally preoccupied with bolstering his own shaky political legitimacy by pandering to the Revolutionary
Guards who surround and protect him. The result is corruption on a scale beyond anything the shah's regime
could have imagined.
President Ahmadinejad, also a creature of the Revolutionary Guards, is free to indulge his taste for outlandish
and irresponsible rhetoric. His words keep the international and domestic spotlight glued to him; but the effect
drives away prospective investors and facilitates the U.S. drive to enlist international support for sanctions
against Iran. An American Jewish leader once joked with me that he suspected Ahmadinejad was a Mossad
agent: no one, he observed, had been more helpful in promoting donations to Israel and Israeli causes. At the
same time, under his leadership Iran has inflation and unemployment that are both in double digits.
But to be fair, Ahmadinejad is the first politician in modern Iranian history willing to address the ""third rail"" of
Iranian politics — the immensely costly subsidies on food and energy. His initial efforts to reduce the amount of
subsidized gasoline that Iranians could use met with outbursts of indignation, including torching filling stations.
But these rules now seem to be grudgingly accepted and have eased slightly Iran's energy dilemma. He is now
addressing the low tax rates assessed against merchants. This has also resulted in outrage, including closing
the bazaars in Iran and other major cities. But his campaign seems to be making progress.
These are needed reforms that would be recommended by any responsible economic overseer, including the
International Monetary Fund. Ahmadinejad attempts to balance his daring assaults on the entrenched economic
interests by his belligerent rhetoric, always casting himself as the champion of the little guy. In that he resembles
his populist predecessors, from Juan Peron to Huey Long to Hugo Chavez. Ahmadinejad takes on America and
Israel the way Governor Long took on Standard Oil. But like other populists, Ahmadinejad is the prisoner of his
own eccentric view of the world and his loyalty to lieutenants who may or may not be worthy of his faith in them.
The key question about Iran today is not whether it will be attacked or collapse under sanctions. It is whether Iran
is capable under its present leadership to take a sober decision about how to deal with the outside world. The
Revolutionary Guards have established a dominant position in Iran's military, its economy, and its politics. Iran
increasingly comes to resemble the corporatist states of southern and eastern Europe in the 1920s and '30s that
we call fascist. Iran is conducting an interior battle with its own demons, from the millenarians on the far right
who choose to believe that Khamene'i is the personal representative of God on earth, to the pragmatic
conservatives who simply want a more responsible leadership, to the reformists of the Green movement whose
objective is to put the ""republic"" back into the Islamic Republic by giving the people a greater voice.
This is a yeasty and unpredictable mix. No one knows what is going to happen next.
And this is the reality that the Obama administration must deal with. The danger is not that the administration will
back the wrong horse in Iran. The real danger is that the Obama administration will be so preoccupied with
domestic American politics and its constant demand to look tough when dealing with Iran that it will
inadvertently rescue this cruel but hapless regime from its own ineptitude by providing a convenient scapegoat
for everything that goes wrong in Iran.","['Iran', 'Iran', 'Israel', 'United', 'States', 'Iran', 'Iran', 'United', 'States', 'Israel', 'Iraq', 'Israel', 'Iraq', 'Iran', 'Iraq', 'United', 'States', 'Iraq', 'United', 'States', 'Iran', 'Iran', 'Iran', 'Iran', 'Iran', 'Iran', 'Iran', 'U.S.', 'Iran', 'Israel', 'Iran', 'Iran', 'Iran', 'America', 'Israel', 'Iran', 'Iran', 'Iran', 'Iran', 'Europe', 'Iran', 'Islamic', 'Republic', 'Iran', 'Iran', 'Iran']"

DRAFT STATEMENT BY SECRETARY CLINTON
Urging Iran to Respect the Fundamental Freedoms of its Citizens
The United States is deeply concerned that Iran continues to deny its citizens their civil rights, as well as to intimidate
and detain those Iranians who seek to hold their government accountable and who stand up for the rights of their
fellow citizens. We remain troubled by the case of Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani, who garnered international attention
for her verdict of death by stoning. While the Iranian government later stated she would not face execution by stoning,
her fate has been left unclear. We are also troubled by reports that Ebrahim Hamidi, an 18-year old charged with
homosexuality, faces imminent execution despite the fact that he is currently without legal representation. Neither of
their cases have proceeded with the transparency or due process enshrined in Iran's own constitution and their lawyer,
Mohammad Mostafaei, felt that he had no other choice than to flee Iran after he had been questioned by authorities
and his family members had been detained.
We are also concerned about the fate of Iranians who are in danger of imminent execution for exercising their right to
free expression after the June 2009 elections, including Jafar Kazemi, Mohammad Haj Aghaei, and Javad Lan.
The United States urges the Iranian government to halt these executions in accordance with its international obligations
to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and calls for the immediate release of all political prisoners
and imprisoned human rights defenders. The United States will continue to stand with people all around the world who
seek to exercise their universal rights and to speak out in defense of human liberties.","['Iran', 'Iran', 'United', 'States', 'Iran', 'Iran', 'Iran', 'United', 'States', 'United', 'States']"

Inners arid Losers
Ey ROGER COHEN
NEW YORK — The Clintons threw a big Washington bash on June 30 for Hillary Clinton's longtime aide, Hume Abedin,
and what struck one of the many guests was the absence of anyone from President Obama's tight White House inner
circle.
Congressional heavyweights thronged the garden of the Clinton spread on Embassy Row, including House Speaker
Nancy Pelosi. The city's big powerbrokers and various State Department honchos were there for a party marking Abedin's
marriage to Congressman Anthony Weiner of New York. But White House insiders stayed away.
Well, as Bill Clinton told CNN recently, ""I did everything I could to defeat President Obama and I wanted Hillary to win"" —
old wounds do not heal overnight. Indeed, they may not heal at all. When my informant said something about the old
grievances not going away, the response from the hosts went something like this:
No, they don't and they never will. But, we're public servants and suckers for punishment, so we soldier on.
Speaking of soldiering on, Mrs. Clinton left for Europe the next day and while Americans celebrated July 4, she was in
Armenia trying to sort out the Nagorno-Karabakh dispute and.— equally thankless task — mediate between Armenia and
Turkey on their disagreement over what happened in 1915.
You've got to salute Hillary. She's got guts to go with that razor-sharp mind. It's a heck of a job being secretary of state
when the White House puts a tight collar around the big issues — Afghanistan, Iran, Israel-Palestine and Iraq — and
you're left with Nagorno-Karabakh, disputed Ottoman crimes of World War I and, if you're lucky, U.S. bases on Okinawa.
The situation might be slightly less troubling if the boys in the White House — and they are overwhelmingly boys — were
foreign-policy heavyweights. They're not. Indeed, I'm told Henry Kissinger refers to them as ""the kids.""
Chief among them, according to my colleague Helene Cooper, is Denis McDonough, the National Security Council's chief
of staff. Earlier this month, Cooper wrote: ""Forget Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton or Defense Secretary Robert
M. Gates. When it comes to national security, Mr. Obama's inner circle is so tight it largely consists of Mr. McDonough, a
40-year-old from Minnesota who is unknown to most Americans.""
I do know McDonough and I've spent a fair amount of time in Minnesota. He has many of the state's qualities: positive,
brisk, can-do, affable and efficient.
But am I reassured when! read that Obama's national-security inner circle is comprised of him? Nope. He was a great
guy to control the foreign-policy side of a campaign — as he did to perfection for Obama — but he's not a great guy to
think big about the world.
Thinking big and bold is required right now. The clock is ticking on momentous presidential decisions. Among them are an
Afghan extrication that will salvage a minimum of core U.S. security interests — which will require a bruising negotiation
with the Taliban — and what to do about Iran when it becomes apparent by the end of this year that the latest sanctions
have changed nothing. Obama's apparent carte blanche to Israel this month on Iran was disturbing.
Then there's Israel-Palestine, where Obama can't decide whether the cost of being an honest broker pressure on both
sides — is worth the domestic heat he takes for being critical of Israel, with the result that he's zigzagging to little effect.
After firing Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, Obama said he would tolerate debate but not division. My sense is his foreign-
policy house is divided — and the weaker for it. Gen. James Jones, his national security adviser, speaks fine French —
the French love that — but he's left most people unconvinced. Tom Donilon, Jones' deputy, dances around the vacuum
as best he can. Like McDonough, David Axelrod and Rehm Emanuel were brilliant campaign strategists, but should they
be foreign-policy strategists?
In Clinton, Obama has a Baker-class secretary of state. For how much longer is he going to delegate her to Nagorno-
Karabakh? The State Department, a repository of Other underused talent, cannot be the White House annex for non-
critical affairs.
Back in the 1860s, James Gordon Bennett, then the editor of the New York Herald, a forebear of the International Herald
Tribune, gave these instructions to an intrepid foreign correspondent named Henry Morton Stanley:
""Draw a thousand pounds now; and when you have gone through that, draw another thousand, and when that is spent,
draw another thousand, and when you have finished that, draw another thousand, and so on; but, FIND LIVINGSTONE.""
He was referring to the lost African explorer, David Livingstone, whom Stanley eventually tracked down on Lake
Tanganyika, uttering the immortal words: ""Doctor Livingstone, I presume?""
That sort of journalism's gone out of fashion. So we can all thank Rolling Stone for opening its pocketbook and telling
Michael Hastings to do whatever it took to find General McChrystal. In his brilliant piece, Hastings did that. He also found
something else: an Afghan policy as fragmented as the team Obama running it.
McChrystal's gone, but not the dysfunction. A blow-up, I presume? Watch this space.","['NEW', 'YORK', 'Washington', 'White', 'House', 'New', 'York', 'Europe', 'Armenia', 'Nagorno-Karabakh', 'Armenia', 'Turkey', 'White', 'House', 'Afghanistan', 'Iran', 'Iraq', 'Nagorno-Karabakh', 'U.S.', 'Okinawa', 'White', 'House', 'Minnesota', 'Minnesota', 'U.S.', 'Iran', 'Israel', 'Iran', 'Israel', 'Karabakh', 'Lake', 'Tanganyika']"

hearing. I thought holbrooke was polite and responsive.",['Afghanistan']
5593,Heads Up: Netanyahu TapeFYI,[]
5594,FW: The Cable - Development,[]
5595,"CorkerAnd pasted below is the exchange between Corker and Holbrooke:
CORKER:
Mr. Chairman, thank you.
I want to thank the ambassador for coming. I know he has a wealth of knowledge and certainly served our country for
many years.
A number of us wrote a letter to you asking for this hearing, and my guess is you might have had hearings any way.
But the reason we wrote the letter -- bipartisan letter -- was to provide Congress and the American people with a
definition of the end state for our civilian operations in Afghanistan, clear objectives for the civilian mission, and a
detailed plan for achieving those objectives, and the very specific, measurable metrics being used to measure progress
towards achieving those objectives.
I have to say, I've been here for an hour and 10 minutes. I have heard nothing -- nothing -- about that. And while I
respect the ambassador, I've heard a lot of process. I've heard a lot about meetings. I have no earthly idea -- no earthly
idea what our objectives are on the civilian front.
And I don't know if you have time to begin doing that right now, but this has so far been an incredible waste of time,
from the standpoint of -- of hearing, though.
And I have tremendous respect for you, but maybe we have the wrong witness. I hope we'll have maybe Secretary
Clinton and Eikenberry, maybe Crocker. I know he's supposed to come.
But could you answer the question that was the purpose of these hearings in the first place?
HOLBROOKE:
I'm sorry. You don't feel that I've told you what our civilian programs are?
CORKER:
You've told me a lot of process. I'd like to know a definition of what our end state is for civilian operations, the very
question we asked when we set this hearing up, is in Afghanistan, clear objectives for the -- for the -- detailed plan for
achieving those. I'd like to hear you talk about that.
I mean, I'm glad we have a lot of interagency folks here, but I'm not hearing anything that talks about where we're
going.
I'd also like to know how the withdrawal date that's been set affects that and how it affects those we're working with
in the country.
HOLBROOKE:
First of all, Senator Corker, I believe I have discussed our civilian programs in very considerable detail within the
constraints of time, but we did prepare a report for this committee earlier this year, which was entered into the record
and which I will be happy to enter into the record again, if you wish. And you can go through every one of the programs.
The reason I brought my colleagues with me was to show that this was a whole-of-government, an unprecedented
effort.
Now, on the specifics, since you want specifics, Afghanistan is an agricultural country. It exported agricultural products
until 1978 and the Soviet invasion. We are trying to rebuild it. This was not being done for the first seven years of this
war.
We have -- your -- your committee has given us a great deal of money for agriculture. And we are spending it wisely in
a joint AID- USDA effort, which Senator Lugar has particularly been involved in, food, seeds, cash-for-work programs,
encouraging alternatives to opium production.
HOLBROOKE:
Secondly, rule of law. We are spending -- we are spending the money you have authorized for us to create a justice
system which can cut into the Taliban's propaganda about corruption and lack of a justice system.
Third, counter-narcotics. We have ended poppy eradication, a radical change, because all we were doing by
eradicating poppy seeds, poppy crops, was driving farmers, poor farmers, into the hands of the Taliban.
Fourth, a major program of subnational governance, where we are putting aid directly to the district level.
Fifth, a major effort in specific areas, some of which were alluded to earlier, such as electricity for Kandahar. Senator
Kerry asked earlier about Kandahar. One of the major issues here is to bring electricity to the people as a benefit of the
international presence.
The whole range of activities we have is designed to support the country and to support General Petraeus' counter-
insurgency effort. He and I -- I was his counterpart until two weeks ago when he moved to Kabul. We have worked
intimately in an effort to create a joint civilian-military effort. And I am happy to provide you with every detail you wish
in private briefings on behalf of me and my team.
Point number two in regard to the end state issue you raised. I want to be clear on the difference between end state
and exit strategy.
If we -- this is my personal view, senator -- but if we walk away from Afghanistan, again, as we did 21 years ago, the
consequences will be similarly catastrophic, because of the unique strategic position of Afghanistan and the reaction
that would have in Pakistan, China, India and the country to Afghanistan's west, Iran, as well as the larger region that
includes Russia, Saudi Arabia, India, and even extending to Western Europe, which is concerned about terrorism from
that region, just as much as we are.
So, I hope that when we talk about end state, we talk about a sustainable end state which involves continued
American economic and development assistance, and we continue to fulfill our obligations to train the police and the
military. This will not be cheap. But it will be a fraction of the money that is now being authorized and appropriated for
the military campaign.
When we will be able to transition to that is impossible for me or anyone to say. But it won't be on a single day. It will
be a gradual process. And that is what the review in December and the president's decision-making will focus on.
CORKER:
In our foreign policy, generally speaking -- I know we've had some rough times over the last several years -- it's been
something that we've been able to address in a bipartisan way. And I think that the issues that you're dealing with, that
we're dealing with in Afghanistan are incredibly tough.
I still don't -- I haven't understood what the administration was saying in the beginning. That's not to be critical of
them. I just don't understand. I still don't understand. I've met with you and your staff over at the State Department. It's
just incredibly vague to me.
And I think what we are doing, we have partners, which include the Pakistanis and everybody around, that they don't
know what we're doing. They don't know when we're leaving. They think we're leaving shortly, I think. We've just had
colleagues who have come from there.
We've had a -- we've got a president there that's having to play both sides, because he wants to survive, because he
doesn't know what our intentions are. The Pakistanis don't know what our intentions are, I don't think. And they're
making accommodations on both sides.
So, I just have to tell you, I send letters to parents and spouses. And what I feel because of this lack of clarity is that we
are in Afghanistan, because we're in Afghanistan, and that we don't have the will to be successful. And we don't have
the will to leave, because of some of the things you just outlined.
But I just don't hear any clarity. And again, I want to support the administration. I want to support you, because that's
what we need to do as a country, is let the shores (ph) align (ph), let the partisanship.
But I have to tell you, as a person who wants to do that, I still don't understand. OK? And I have average intelligence,
so I would ask you to, please -- or maybe let's have some witnesses in here that can shed more light or be more specific.
But I don't understand, and I'm very concerned.
And I think we're sending a lot of mixed signals. And I think there's a lot of dissension. Actually, as I listen to you, even
within the administration itself, and that has to end.
And I just ask you, please. You have a lot of experience, help us understand. You haven't done that today. And I would
ask the chairman to please have some witnesses come in and explain to us what the end state is, what we can envision
Afghanistan being whenever this withdrawal does take place, because I still do not understand.
We've changed it. Now it's sort of a degraded country where they have conflict, but it's not out of control. I mean, the
bar continues to change. And I'm just concerned as an individual, and yet I want us to be, if we can, all on the same page
as much as possible. But I think to do that, this has got to be much clearer than has been outlined.
HOLBROOKE:
Senator, I'm sorry that my answers don't fully satisfy you. But I want to be very clear on this, because I understand
your comments and I respect them.
First of all, the core question -- the one you are asked by your constituents, and I'm asked by everybody -- why are we
in Afghanistan? The short, simple answer is 9/11, direct threats to our national security interests, and the fact that while
our enemies against our homeland are on the Pakistani side of the border, this is a single struggle. And we have to
strengthen the Afghan government and let -- and teach it to stand on its own feet over time, so that we can move
forward, while we do other things that fall outside the scope of this hearing, to dismantle, deter and defeat Al Qaida.
Now, if you do not believe that it's a threat to the homeland, then we have an honest difference of opinion. But I think
the Times Square bombing incident shows clearly how dangerous that situation is.
Secondly, on the civilian mission, again, it's in support of a single, civilian-military, counter-insurgency mission. And we
have benchmarks, requested and required by the Congress, and submitted to you. And our overarching goal here is
always the same, to disrupt, dismantle and defeat Al Qaida and prevent its ability to threaten the United States.
And we believe, all of us -- and there is no division on this in the executive branch -- that the situation we face out
there is a direct threat. We believe that before the Times Square situation occurred, and I don't think anything could
have proved it more vividly.
And to achieve this, we have to degrade the Taliban as well, because they are part of the enemy's structure -- a
different part, but an integral part -- that we face.
Now, the Afghan government doesn't yet have the capacity to deal with this on its own. How could they after 30 years
of war? And so, the civilian part of it, the things I've just mentioned to you -- police, government capacity, rule of law,
subnational government, training provincial officials, women's empowerment and a whole series of other major issues --
are part of our civilian programs.
And we're happy to come back up to your office -- we appreciated your visit to us -- and continue this dialogue.
Our civilian strategy is designed from keeping Al Qaida at bay, and it's designed to help Afghan institutions establish
conditions for stable governance. Our plan has these benchmarks, which have been briefed to you and your colleagues,
and we're happy to discuss them in detail at any time.","['Afghanistan', 'Afghanistan', 'Afghanistan', 'Kandahar', 'Kandahar', 'Kabul', 'Afghanistan', 'Afghanistan', 'Pakistan', 'China', 'India', 'Afghanistan', 'Iran', 'Russia', 'Saudi', 'Arabia', 'India', 'Western', 'Europe', 'Afghanistan', 'Afghanistan', 'Afghanistan', 'Afghanistan', 'Afghanistan', 'United', 'States']"

including at this week's hearing. He also has broader concerns about the lack of a clear end state and metrics for our
Afghan policy, but the main reason he wants to talk to you is about Holbrooke.

Fibi Netanyahu
In 20015 PM boasted of manipulating Oslo accords
By I Jul 15, 2010 4:03 PM
Netanyahu in 2001.
CREDIT: ::nl 1
Meeting with Benjamin Netanyahu last week, President Obama could not have been more effusive. ""I believe Prime
Minister Netanyahu wants peace,"" Obama :3411 ill. ""I believe he is ready to take risks for peace.""
A newly revealed tape of Netanyahu in 2001, being interviewed while he thinks the cameras are off, shows him in a
radically different light. in it, Netanyahu dismisses American foreign policy as easy to maneuver, boasts of having derailed
the Oslo accords with political trickery, and suggests that the only way to deal with the Palestinians is to ""beat them up,
not once but repeatedly, beat them up so it hurts so badly, until it's unbearable"" (all translations are mine).
PI to Haaretz's Gideon Levy, the video should be ""Banned for viewing by children so as not to corrupt them, and
distributed around the country and the world so that everyone will know who leads the government of Israel.""
Netanyahu is speaking to a small group of terror victims in the West Bank settlement of Ofra two years after stepping
down as prime minister in 1999. He appears laid-back. After claiming that the only way to deal with the Palestinian
Authority was a large-scale attack, Netanyahu was asked by one of the participants whether or not the United States
would let such an attack come to fruition.
""I know what America is,"" Netanyahu replied. ""America is'a thing you can move very easily, move it in the right direction.
They won't get in their way."" He then called former president Bill Clinton ""radically pro-Palestinian,"" and went on to belittle
the Oslo peace accords as vulnerable to manipulation. Since the accords state that Israel would be allowed to hang on to
pre-defined military zones in the West Bank, Netanyahu told his hosts that he could torpedo the accords by defining vast
swaths of land as just that.
""They asked me before the election if rd honor [the Oslo accords],"" Netanyahu said. ""I said I would, but ... I'm going to
interpret the accords in such a way that would allow me to put an end to this gallOping forward to the '67 borders. How did
we do it? Nobody said what defined military zones were. Defined military zones aresecurity zones; as far as I'm
concerned, the entire Jordan Valley is a defined military zone. Go argue.""
Smiling, Netanyahu then recalled how he forced former U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher to agree to let Israel
alone determine which parts of the West Bank were to be defined as military zones. ""They didn't want to give me that
letter,"" Netanyahu said, ""so I didn't give them the Hebron agreement [the agreement giving Hebron back to the
Palestinians]. I cut the cabinet meeting short and said, 'I'm not signing.' Only when the letter came, during that meeting, to
me and to Arafat, did I ratify the Hebron agreement. Why is this important? Because from that moment on, I de facto put
an end to the Oslo accords.""
President Obama, and anyone else concerned about Israel's commitment to the peace process, may watch the tape
online here PI.

First major ministerial in Afghanistan since the 1970s. The very fact of it is a big deal.
Context is important. This is not out of the blue, it's not just a random gathering; it's part of a systematic process:
Karzai's inauguration, announcement of the President's strategy, London conference, Peace Jirga, and now the Kabul
conference.
Increasing Afghan leadership and ownership: They are presenting a set of concrete programs on governance, service
delivery, security transition, economic development, and reintegration. These programs are detailed; they are serious;
and they reflect months of work and consultation.
Increasing international alignment: The international community is coordinating with each other - through ISAF, Sedwill,
de Mistura, etc. - and aligning its efforts with the Afghan programs and priorities being set forth at this conference. This
is NOT a pledging conference. It is an opportunity to ensure we are effectively supporting Afghan government
leadership and ownership
Follow-through and accountability: In his inauguration, Karzai laid out a credible vision; in London, the Afghan
government committed to developing and pursuing specific plans in a variety of areas; at Kabul, we'll be heavily focused
on implementation. This is about mutual accountability for the pledges made and the programs set forth.
July 2011: The president's strategy reflects both urgency and resolve: increased resources and intensity in our efforts to
take the fight to the enemy and to build Afghan capacity to effect a conditions-based transition; and a long-term civilian
commitment to support Afghanistan long into the future.
Clear strategy: Reverse the momentum of the Taliban; build the capacity of Afghan security forces; and as Afghans
develop the capability to stabilize their country, we must draw down our combat presence and make a responsible
transition to Afghan leadership.
Clear desired end-state: An Afghan state that is willing and strong enough to ensure that global terrorists never again
have safe haven within its borders; can withstand internal and external threats; and can continue to make long-term
political and economic progress, all with sustainable levels of international support.
Civ-mil cooperation: Unfortunate to lose General McChrystal, but maintained continuity with General Petraeus and we
have only intensified our civ-mil engagement both in Kabul and Washington.
Reconciliation: Stress that it is Afghan-led. Note red-lines.","['Afghanistan', 'London', 'Kabul', 'London', 'Kabul', 'Afghanistan', 'Kabul', 'Washington']"

5618,"Readout from Afghan women's conference over the weekend.The writer is someone who has worked with Afghan women in developing small businesses in Afghanistan and is doing a
book about the experience.
She went back to Afghanistan for the conference that women had over the weekend and wrote the article that follows
for today's Daily Beast.
Soraya mentioned here is one of our Women of Courage. Gayle (the writer) told me in a separate email that De Mistura
was very sympathetic and said they should be consulted, that the current documents are working documents and he
pledged that the women would be more inovled in the follow up. He also told them that he was very impressed that
they had organized themselves in this 2-day conference to be able to play a more effective role. Zakhilwal was gracious,
but said they were adequately consulted. So it goes.
Secretary Clinton may be one of the highest-profile attendees at Tuesday's Kabul Conference, but
Afghan women fear their opinions won't be heard—and they worry new deals with fighters will roll
back their hard-fought rights.
As Hillary Clinton prepares to attend Tuesday's Kabul Conference, Afghan women are delivering a plain message to
government and international officials: Women's voices should be heard.
""We have to be honest. With respect to the Kabul Conference, we have not been consulted,"" said Soraya Pakzad, founder
of a women's shelter in the western Afghan city of Herat. Her comment came during an unusually heated question-and-
answer session with Afghan Finance Minister Omar Zakhilwal and United Nations representative Staffan de
Mistura marking the end of a two-day women's conference. ""We want to be involved in policy-making. We don't want our
presence to be purely symbolic.""
""Women's rights and achievements should not be compromised in any peace negotiations or
accords.""
The Kabul Conference is, in part, built on symbolism. A follow-up to January's London Conference, the gathering marks
the first time Afghanistan has played host to its international donors, a decision that is intended to showcase the transition
from foreign to Afghan ownership of national priorities. More than 65 international delegations are expected to descend
upon the Afghan capital, which is already enduring security crackdowns and traffic gridlock. Workers could be seen
Sunday painting curbs and planting flowers in advance of the foreigners' arrival.
Discussions will center around five topics, including economic development, agriculture, governance, and security. The
goal of the half-day event is to establish a framework for Afghan leadership in the setting—and execution—of the
country's political and economic direction.
Although it remains to be seen how quickly the Afghan govemment, long under-resourced and beset by allegations of
corruption, will be able to take the reins from its international donors, there is no question that Afghan ownership is the
direction in which things are moving, on the political, economic, and security fronts. And that is precisely why women feel
the stakes for this week's meeting are so high, particularly in light of new deals to empower local militias that might
threaten women's rights.
""After the Kabul Conference, no one knows what else could be on the agenda apart from war escalations and
negotiations,"" said Orzala Ashraf, an Afghan human rights activist. ""This is very important for us, to get a serious and
honest commitment from our government in the presence of all witnesses from the world that our voices will not be
silenced.""
Ashraf and a number of other women's advocates view Tuesday's talks are their last, best shot at speaking out about their
concerns, with help from European and American officials who have been working hard to help them win a seat at the
table. In another show of support, Secretary Clinton and Danish Foreign Minister Lene Espersen will meet Tuesday
morning with a group of women leaders.
Regardless of this high-profile backing, many women say they have little faith in the process to produce anything aside
from more paper and more unkept promises.
""Women are very tired of all these conferences; the government is going to have to show commitments,"" said Selay
Ghaffar, an Afghan Women's Network board member. ""We want things to change.""
And it remains unclear how many Afghans outside Kabul, men or women, are paying attention to yet another gathering to
discuss their future.
""Women in the provinces don't even know about this,"" said Zainab, a young math teacher from Helmand province. ""I
would say 60 percent of women have no idea this is going on.""
Others say the presence of one or two women at the Kabul Conference isn't enough to make a difference. And they say
they fear the recent move from NATO to empower local militias to fight the Taliban, particularly in southern Afghanistan.
""This is very dangerous,"" said Shahida Hussain, a human rights advocate from Kandahar who worked as a community
organizer during the Taliban years. ""We had militias during the communist years and Afghanistan was destroyed. We fear
war again.""
Women leaders say that they want peace and are glad to welcome back former fighters, but only if they respect women's
constitutional guarantee to equal protections under the law.
""Women should be a constituent part of all bodies outlined in the Afghanistan Peace and Reintegration Plan,"" said the
women in a statement at the end of their meeting. ""Women's rights and achievements should not be compromised in any
peace negotiations or accords.""
In the meantime, women continue to fight for a voice as Tuesday approaches. After a weeklong flurry of conference calls,
embassy meetings, and lunchtime gatherings, two women aside from government ministers are now slated to speak.
And in a small victory for women, international officials agreed with Pakzad's assessment before pledging that women
would be more involved going forward.
""I agree, you were not consulted,"" said da Mistura, appearing to contradict the Afghan finance minister, who only a few
moments earlier had said that women's views had and would be included. ""As usual, we have been paying lip service to
you and we are all at fault for that.""

RIYADH (AFP)— An ""inept"" United States cannot fix Afghanistan's problems and should simply focus on ""chasing the
terrorists"" there, former Saudi intelligence chief Prince Turki al-Faisal said on Saturday.
The ex-ambassador to the United States also challenged Washington to produce results in just-started Middle East
peace talks, and accused US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton of undermining efforts to make the region nuclear-free.
AFP — Saudi Arabia's former intelligence chief Prince Turki al-Faisal delivers a speech during a conference ...
In a speech in Riyadh before diplomats, Turki said US-led NATO troops had irrevocably alienated the Afghan people and
had no hope of rebuilding the country.
""What Afghanistan needs now is a shift from nation-building to effectively countering terrorists,"" Turki told the Arab
News conference.
US President Barack Obama ""should not be misdirected into believing that he can fix Afghanistan's ills by military
means.""
""Hunt down the terrorists on both sides of the Afghan-Pakistan border, arrest them or kill them, and get out, and let the
Afghan people deal with their problems.
""As long as GI boots remain on Afghan soil, they remain targets of resistance for the Afghan people and ideological
mercenaries.""
Turki, who has long served a central role in Saudi-Afghan relations, scolded Washington's handling of relations with
Kabul.
""The inept way in which this administration has dealt with President (Hamid) Karzai beggars disbelief and amazement.
""Both sides are now filled with resentment and a sour taste in their mouths,"" he said. ""How can they both get out of that
situation? I don't know.""
The chairman of the King Faisal Center For Research and Islamic Studies, Turki has no official position but is believed to
often reflect high level thinking in the Saudi government.
He is the brother of Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal, and analysts speculate he could become foreign minister
when Saud retires.
Turki said Arab states have given Washington four months to show progress in US-guided Palestinian-Israeli peace talks.
""The Arab world has given Obama until September to get things done,"" said Turki.
""It is not enough to talk the talk. He has to walk the walk.
""If he does not succeed... then I (will) ask President Obama to do the morally decent gesture and recognise the
Palestinian state that he so ardently wishes to exist.
""He can then pack up and leave us in peace and let the Palestinians, Syrians and Lebanese negotiate directly with the
Israelis. No more platitudes and good wishes and visions, please.""
Turki also faulted the US and European approach in trying to halt Iran's alleged efforts to build a nuclear weapon.
""The discussions on Iran's nuclear ambitions started off on the wrong foot. The carrot and stick approach does not
work,"" he said.
For one, he said, the US and Europe have had double-standards in dealing with Iran on the one hand, and other nuclear
countries on the other.
""You cannot ask Iran to play on one level while you allow Israel, India, Pakistan, and North Korea to play on other levels.""
Turki said a successful strategy toward Iran requires even-handedness, a ""universal nuclear security umbrella"" for the
countries in the area, and ""a good military option"" against any regional country which does not cooperate.
He said Clinton had undermined efforts to move toward a regional nuclear-free zone, after the UN Security Council's five
permanent members recently expressed support for the idea.
""Alas... Clinton then voided the issue of its value by stating that the conditions do not yet exist for establishing the zone,""
he said.
""Why, then, did she join the other members of the P5 in issuing their statement?""
Turki said he hoped Obama ""will find the way to correct his secretary of state's nullification of making our area free of
weapons of mass destruction.""
Turki also warned of rising violence in Iraq after the pullout of US troops next year, warning both internal and external
groups seek to carve up the country.
""Imagine what will happen once internal strife and fighting escalates"" following the US pullout, he said.
Without a UN Security Council effort to protect Iraq's current borders, the consequence could be ""regional conflict on a
scale not seen since the Ottoman-Safavid wars of the 17th and 18th centuries,"" he warned.","['US', 'Afghanistan', 'RIYADH', 'United', 'States', 'Afghanistan', 'United', 'States', 'Washington', 'Middle', 'East', 'US', 'Saudi', 'Arabia', 'Riyadh', 'Afghanistan', 'US', 'Afghanistan', 'Washington', 'Kabul', 'Washington', 'US-guided', 'Palestinian-Israeli', 'US', 'Iran', 'Iran', 'US', 'Europe', 'Iran', 'Iran', 'Israel', 'India', 'Pakistan', 'North', 'Korea', 'Iran', 'Iraq', 'US', 'US', 'Iraq']"

5639,"AP/Afghanistan SanctionsWASHINGTON (AP) - The Obama administration targeted key leaders of Afghanistan's Taliban with new financial
sanctions Thursday in a move that could complicate relations with Pakistan and Afghan efforts to reconcile with
insurgents.
The action by the Treasury Department will freeze the militants' assets, ban travel and trigger an arms embargo. It
follows similar action by the United Nations earlier this week, and comes after calls from Gen. David Petraeus, the top
military commander in Afghanistan, and Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, for
sanctions against Afghan insurgent commanders operating in Pakistan.
Taken together, the U.S. and U.N. sanctions prohibit any financial transactions of the terror leaders in U.N. member
countries, putting additional pressure on Pakistan to take broader actions against the Taliban militants.
Three financial kingpins were targeted with sanctions, including a key member of the Haqqani network, which,directs
operations against U.S. and coalition forces in Afghanistan from safe havens in Pakistan. Among those sanctioned
Thursday was Nasiruddin Haqqani, an emissary for the Haqqani Network and brother of Sirajuddin Haqqani who leads
the group with his father, Jalaluddin.
Others sanctioned included Gul Agha Ishakzai, the head of the Taliban's financial commission and Amir Abdullah, the
former treasurer to captured Taliban leader Mullah Abdul Ghani Barader. The sanctions placed on the three leaders as
terrorists would deprive them of the assets they need to fund their terror operations, said Adam J. Szubin, director of
Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control. ""We will continue to aggressively work to expose and dismantle the financial
networks of terrorist groups in support of the president's goal of a stable Afghanistan,"" he said.
According to officials, lshakzai is the head of the Taliban's financial commission, has collected money for suicide attacks
in Kandahar, Afghanistan, and has been involved in the disbursement of funds for Taliban fighters. He has served as a
main financial officer and close adviser to Taliban leader Mullah Mohammad Omar. Abdullah has reportedly traveled to
Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Libya and the United Arab Emirates to raise money for the Taliban and facilitate meetings and
communications with key leaders. Nasiruddin Haqqani has collected funds for the Haqqani group, including from al-
Qaida. Last week, Gen. David Petraeus, the top military commander in Afghanistan, urged officials to add commanders
from the Haqqani network to the terrorist list. At the time, administration officials said a review was under way, largely
accelerated after the May 1 failed Times Square bombing. The man who has pleaded guilty in the New York incident,
Pakistani-born American Faisal Shahzad, said he trained with the Pakistani Taliban to build bombs, then returned to the
U.S. to launch an attack that would avenge attacks on Muslims by U.S. forces overseas.","['Afghanistan', 'Pakistan', 'Afghanistan', 'D-Mich.', 'Pakistan', 'U.S.', 'Pakistan', 'U.S.', 'Afghanistan', 'Pakistan', 'Afghanistan', 'Kandahar', 'Afghanistan', 'Kuwait', 'Saudi', 'Arabia', 'Libya', 'United', 'Arab', 'Emirates', 'Afghanistan', 'New', 'York', 'U.S.', 'U.S.']"

The Failure of the American Jewish Establishment
June 10, 2010
by Peter Beinart
E-mail Single Page Share More by Peter Beinart
anjamin Netanyahu; drawing by John Springs
In 2003, several prominent Jewish philanthropists hired Republican pollster Frank Luntz to explain why American Jewish
college students were not more vigorously rebutting campus criticism of Israel. In response, he unwittingly produced the
most damning indictment of the organized American Jewish community that I have ever seen.
The philanthropists wanted to know what Jewish students thought about Israel. Luntz found that they mostly didn't. ""Six
times we have brought Jewish youth together as a group to talk about their Jewishness and connection to Israel,"" he
reported. ""Six times the topic of Israel did not come up until it was prompted. Six times these Jewish youth used the word
'they' rather than'us` to describe the situation.""
That Luntz encountered indifference was not surprising. In recent years, several studies have revealed, in the words of
Steven Cohen of Hebrew Union College and An Kelman of the University of California at Davis, that ""non-Orthodox
younger Jews, on the whole, feel much less attached to Israel than their elders,"" with many professing ""a near-total
absence of positive feelings."" In 2008, the student senate at Brandeis, the only nonsectarian Jewish-sponsored university
in America, rejected a resolution commemorating the sixtieth anniversary of the Jewish state.
Luntz's task was to figure out what had gone wrong. When he probed the students' views of Israel, he hit up against some
firm beliefs. First, ""they reserve the right to question the Israeli position."" These young Jews, Luntz explained, ""resist
anything they see as 'group think."" They want an ""open and frank"" discussion of Israel and its flaws. Second, ""young
Jews desperately want peace."" When Luntz showed them a series of ads, one of the most popular was entitled ""Proof that
Israel Wants Peace,"" and listed offers by various Israeli governments to withdraw from conquered land. Third, ""some
empathize with the plight of the Palestinians."" When Luntz displayed ads depicting Palestinians as violent and hateful,
several focus group participants criticized them as stereotypical and unfair, citing their own Muslim friends.
Most of the students, in other words, were liberals, broadly defined. They had imbibed some of the defining values of
American Jewish political culture: a belief in open debate, a skepticism about military force, a commitment to human
rights. And in their innocence, they did not realize that they were supposed to shed those values when it came to Israel.
The only kind of Zionism they found attractive was a Zionism that recognized Palestinians as deserving of dignity and
capable of peace, and they were quite willing to condemn an Israeli government that did not share those beliefs. Luntz did
not grasp the irony. The only kind of Zionism they found attractive was the kind that the American Jewish establishment
has been working against for most of their lives.
Among American Jews today, there are a great many Zionists, especially in the Orthodox world, people deeply devoted to
the State of Israel. And there are a great many liberals, especially in the secular Jewish world, people deeply devoted to
human rights for all people, Palestinians included. But the two groups are increasingly distinct. Particularly in the younger
generations, fewer and fewer American Jewish liberals are Zionists; fewer and fewer American Jewish Zionists are liberal.
One reason is that the leading institutions of American Jewry have refused to foster—indeed, have actively opposed—a
Zionism that challenges Israel's behavior in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and toward its own Arab citizens. For several
decades, the Jewish establishment has asked American Jews to check their liberalism at Zionism's door, and now, to their
horror, they are finding that many young Jews have checked their Zionism instead.
Morally, American Zionism is in a downward spiral. If the leaders of groups like AIPAC and the Conference of Presidents
of Major American Jewish Organizations do not change course, they will wake up one day to find a younger, Orthodox-
dominated, Zionist leadership whose naked hostility to Arabs and Palestinians scares even them, and a mass of secular
American Jews who range from apathetic to appalled. Saving liberal Zionism in the United States—so that American Jews
can help save liberal Zionism in Israel—is the great American Jewish challenge of our age. And it starts where Luntz's
students wanted it to start: by talking frankly about Israel's current government, by no longer averting our eyes.
Since the 1990s, journalists and scholars have been describing a bifurcation in Israeli society. In the words of Hebrew
University political scientist Yaron Ezrahi, ""After decades of what came to be called a national consensus, the Zionist
narrative of liberation [has] dissolved into openly contesting versions."" One version, ""founded on a long memory of
persecution, genocide, and a bitter struggle for survival, is pessimistic, distrustful of non-Jews, and believing only in
Jewish power and solidarity."" Another, ""nourished by secularized Versions of messianism as well as the Enlightenment
idea of progress,"" articulates ""a deep sense of the limits of military force, and a commitment to liberal-democratic values.""
Every country manifests some kind of ideological divide. But in contemporary Israel, the gulf is among the widest on earth.
As Ezrahi and others have noted, this latter, liberal-democratic Zionism has grown alongside a new individualism,
particularly among secular Israelis, a greater demand for free expression, and a greater skepticism of coercive authority.
You can see this spirit in ""new historians"" like Tom Segev who have fearlessly excavated the darker corners of the Zionist
past and in jurists like former Supreme Court President Aharon Barak who have overturned Knesset laws that violate the
human rights guarantees in Israel's ""Basic Laws."" You can also see it in former Prime Minister Ehud Barak's apparent
willingness to relinquish much of the West Bank in 2000 and early 2001.
But in Israel today, this humane, universalistic Zionism does not wield power. To the contrary, it is gasping for air. To
understand how deeply antithetical its values are to those of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government, it's worth
considering the case of Effi Eitam. Eitam, a charismatic ex–cabinet minister and war hero, has proposed ethnically
cleansing Palestinians from the West Bank. ""We'll have to expel the overwhelming majority of West Bank Arabs from here
and remove Israeli Arabs from [the] political system,"" he declared in 2006. In 2008, Eitam merged his small Ahi Party into
Netanyahu's Likud. And for the 2009-2010 academic year, he is Netanyahu's special emissary for overseas ""campus
engagement."" In that capacity, he visited a dozen American high schools and colleges last fall on the Israeli government's
behalf. The group that organized his tour was called ""Caravan for Democracy.""
Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman once shared Eitam's views. In his youth, he briefly joined Meir Kahane's now
banned Kach Party, which also advocated the expulsion of Arabs from Israeli soil. Now Lieberman's position might be
called ""pre-expulsion."" He wants to revoke the citizenship of Israeli Arabs who won't swear a loyalty oath to the Jewish
state. He tried to prevent two Arab parties that opposed Israel's 2008-2009 Gaza war from running candidates for the
Knesset. He said Arab Knesset members who met with representatives of Hamas should be executed. He wants to jail
Arabs who publicly mourn on Israeli Independence Day, and he hopes to permanently deny citizenship to Arabs from
other countries who marry Arab citizens of Israel.
You don't have to be paranoid to see the connection between Lieberman's current views and his former ones. The more
you strip Israeli Arabs of legal protection, and the more you accuse them of treason, the more thinkable a policy of
expulsion becomes. Lieberman's American defenders often note that in theory he supports a Palestinian state. What they
usually fail to mention is that for him, a two-state solution means redrawing Israel's border so that a large chunk of Israeli
Arabs find themselves exiled to another country, without their consent.
Lieberman served as chief of staff during Netanyahu's first term as prime minister. And when it comes to the West Bank,
Netanyahu's own record is in its way even more extreme than his protégé's. In his 1993 book, A Place among the
Nations, Netanyahu not only rejects the idea of a Palestinian state, he denies that there is such a thing as a Palestinian. In
fact, he repeatedly equates the Palestinian bid for statehood with Nazism. An Israel that withdraws from the West Bank,
he has declared, would be a ""ghetto-state"" with ""Auschwitz borders."" And the effort ""to gouge Judea and Samaria [the
West Bank] out of Israel"" resembles Hitler's bid to wrench the German-speaking ""Sudeten district"" from Czechoslovakia in
1938. It is unfair, Netanyahu insists, to ask Israel to concede more territory since it has already made vast, gut-wrenching
concessions. What kind of concessions? It has abandoned its claim to Jordan, which by rights should be part of the
Jewish state.
On the left of Netanyahu's coalition sits Ehud Barak's emasculated Labor Party, but whatever moderating potential it may
have is counterbalanced by what is, in some ways, the most illiberal coalition partner of all, Shas, the ultra-Orthodox party
representing Jews of North African and Middle Eastern descent. At one point, Shas—like some of its Ashkenazi ultra-
Orthodox counterparts—was open to dismantling settlements. In recent years, however, ultra-Orthodox Israelis, anxious
to find housing for their large families, have increasingly moved to the West Bank, where thanks to government subsidies
it is far cheaper to live. Not coincidentally, their political parties have swung hard against territorial compromise. And they
have done so with a virulence that reflects ultra-Orthodox Judaism's profound hostility to liberal values. Rabbi Ovadia
Yosef, Shas's immensely powerful spiritual leader, has called Arabs ""vipers,"" ""snakes,"" and ""ants."" In 2005, after Prime
Minister Ariel Sharon proposed dismantling settlements in the Gaza Strip, Yosef urged that ""God strike him down."" The
official Shas newspaper recently called President Obama ""an Islamic extremist.""
Hebrew University Professor Ze'ev Sternhell is an expert on fascism and a winner of the prestigious Israel Prize.
Commenting on Lieberman and the leaders of Shas in a recent Op-Ed in Haaretz, he wrote, ""The last time politicians
holding views similar to theirs were in power in post–World War II Western Europe was in Franco's Spain."" With their
blessing, ""a crude and multifaceted campaign is being waged against the foundations of the democratic and liberal order.""
Sternhell should know. In September 2008, he was injured when a settler set off a pipe bomb at his house.
Israeli governments come and go, but the Netanyahu coalition is the product of frightening, long-term trends in Israeli
society: an ultra-Orthodox population that is increasing dramatically, a settler movement that is growing more radical and
more entrenched in the Israeli bureaucracy and army, and a Russian immigrant community that is particularly prone to
anti-Arab racism. In 2009, a poll by the Israel Democracy Institute found that 53 percent of Jewish Israelis (and 77 percent
of recent immigrants from the former USSR) support encouraging Arabs to leave the country. Attitudes are worst among
Israel's young. When Israeli high schools held mock elections last year, Lieberman won. This March, a poll found that 56
percent of Jewish Israeli high school students—and more than 80 percent of religious Jewish high school students—
would deny Israeli Arabs the right to be elected to the Knesset. An education ministry official called the survey ""a huge
warning signal in light of the strengthening trends of extremist views among the youth.""
You might think that such trends, and the sympathy for them expressed by some in Israel's government, would occasion
substantial public concern—even outrage—among the leaders of organized American Jewry. You would be wrong. In
Israel itself, voices from the left, and even center, warn in increasingly urgent tones about threats to Israeli democracy.
(Former Prime Ministers Ehud Olmert and Ehud Barak have both said that Israel risks becoming an ""apartheid state"" if it
continues to hold the West Bank. This April, when settlers forced a large Israeli bookstore to stop selling a book critical of
the occupation, Shulamit Aloni, former head of the dovish Meretz Party, declared that ""Israel has not been democratic for
some time now."") But in the United States, groups like AIPAC and the Presidents' Conference patrol public discourse,
scolding people who contradict their vision of Israel as a state in which all leaders cherish democracy and yearn
for peace.
The result is a terrible irony. In theory, mainstream American Jewish organizations still hew to a liberal vision of Zionism.
On its website, AIPAC celebrates Israel's commitment to ""free speech and minority rights."" The Conference of Presidents
declares that ""Israel and the United States share political, moral and intellectual values including democracy, freedom,
security and peace."" These groups would never say, as do some in Netanyahu's coalition, that Israeli Arabs don't deserve
full citizenship and West Bank Palestinians don't deserve human rights. But in practice, by defending virtually anything
any Israeli government does, they make themselves intellectual bodyguards for Israeli leaders who threaten the very
liberal values they profess to admire.
After Israel's elections last February, for instance, Malcolm Hoenlein, executive vice-chairman of the Presidents'
Conference, explained that Avigdor Lieberman's agenda was ""far more moderate than the media has presented it.""
Insisting that Lieberman bears no general animus toward Israeli Arabs, Abraham Foxman, national director of the Anti-
Defamation League, told the Jewish Telegraphic Agency that ""He's not saying expel them. He's not saying punish them.""
(Permanently denying citizenship to their Arab spouses or jailing them if they publicly mourn on Israeli Independence Day
evidently does not qualify as punishment.) The ADL has criticized anti-Arab bigotry in the past, and the American Jewish
Committee, to its credit, warned that Lieberman's proposed loyalty oath would ""chill Israel's democratic political debate.""
But the Forward summed up the overall response of America's communal Jewish leadership in its headline ""Jewish
Leaders Largely Silent on Lieberman's Role in Government.""
Not only does the organized American Jewish community mostly avoid public criticism of the Israeli government, it tries to
prevent others from leveling such criticism as well. In recent years, American Jewish organizations have waged a
campaign to discredit the world's most respected international human rights groups. In 2006, Foxman called an Amnesty
International report on Israeli killing of Lebanese civilians ""bigoted, biased, and borderline anti-Semitic."" The Conference
of Presidents has announced that ""biased NGOs include Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, Christian Aid, [and]
Save the Children."" Last summer, an AIPAC spokesman declared that Human Rights Watch ""has repeatedly
demonstrated its anti-Israel bias."" When the Obama administration awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Mary
Robinson, former UN high commissioner for human rights, the ADL and AIPAC both protested, citing the fact that she had
presided over the 2001 World Conference Against Racism in Durban, South Africa. (Early drafts of the conference report
implicitly accused Israel of racism. Robinson helped expunge that defamatory charge, angering Syria and Iran.)
Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International are not infallible. But when groups like AIPAC and the Presidents'
Conference avoid virtually all public criticism of Israeli actions—directing their outrage solely at Israel's neighbors—they
leave themselves in a poor position to charge bias. Moreover, while American Jewish groups claim that they are simply
defending Israel from its foes, they are actually taking sides in a struggle within Israel between radically different Zionist
visions. At the very moment the Anti-Defamation League claimed that Robinson harbored an ""animus toward Israel,"" an
alliance of seven Israeli human rights groups publicly congratulated her on her award. Many of those groups, like
B'Tselem, which monitors Israeli actions in the Occupied Territories, and the Israeli branch of Physicians for Human
Rights, have been at least as critical of Israel's actions in Lebanon, Gaza, and the West Bank as have Amnesty
International and Human Rights Watch.
All of which raises an uncomfortable question. If American Jewish groups claim that Israel's overseas human rights critics
are motivated by anti- Israeli, if not anti-Semitic, bias, what does that say about Israel's domestic human rights critics?
The implication is clear: they must be guilty of self-hatred, if not treason. American Jewish leaders don't generally say
that, of course, but their allies in the Netanyahu government do. Last summer, Israel's vice prime minister, Moshe Ya'alon,
called the anti-occupation group Peace Now a ""virus."" This January, a right-wing group called Im Tirtzu accused Israeli
human rights organizations of having fed information to the Goldstone Commission that investigated Israel's Gaza war. A
Knesset member from Netanyahu's Likud promptly charged Naomi Chazan, head of the New Israel Fund, which supports
some of those human rights groups, with treason, and a member of Lieberman's party launched an investigation aimed at
curbing foreign funding of Israeli NG0s.
To their credit, Foxman and other American Jewish leaders opposed the move, which might have impaired their own
work. But they are reaping what they sowed. If you suggest that mainstream human rights criticism of Israel's government
is motivated by animus toward the state, or toward Jews in general, you give aid and comfort to those in Israel who make
the same charges against the human rights critics in their midst.
In the American Jewish establishment today, the language of liberal Zionism—with its idioms of human rights, equal
citizenship, and territorial compromise—has been drained of meaning. It remains the lingua franca in part for generational
reasons, because many older American Zionists still see themselves as liberals of a sort. They vote Democratic; they are
unmoved by biblical claims to the West Bank; they see average Palestinians as decent people betrayed by bad leaders;
and they are secular. They don't want Jewish organizations to criticize Israel from the left, but neither do they want them
to be agents of the Israeli right.
These American Zionists are largely the product of a particular era. Many were shaped by the terrifying days leading up to
the Six-Day War, when it appeared that Israel might be overrun, and by the bitter aftermath of the Yom Kippur War, when
much of the world seemed to turn against the Jewish state. In that crucible, Israel became their Jewish identity, often in
conjunction with the Holocaust, which the 1967 and 1973 wars helped make central to American Jewish life. These Jews
embraced Zionism before the settler movement became a major force in Israeli politics, before the 1982 Lebanon war,
before the first intifada. They fell in love with an Israel that was more secular, less divided, and less shaped by the culture,
politics, and theology of occupation. And by downplaying the significance of Avigdor Lieberman, the settlers, and Shas,
American Jewish groups allow these older Zionists to continue to identify with that more internally cohesive, more
innocent Israel of their youth, an Israel that now only exists in their memories.
But these secular Zionists aren't reproducing themselves. Their children have no memory of Arab armies massed on
Israel's border and of Israel surviving in part thanks to urgent military assistance from the United States. Instead, they
have grown up viewing Israel as a regional hegemon and an occupying power. As a result, they are more conscious than
their parents of the degree to which Israeli behavior violates liberal ideals, and less willing to grant Israel an exemption
because its survival seems in peril. Because they have inherited their parents' liberalism, they cannot embrace their
uncritical Zionism. Because their liberalism is real, they can see that the liberalism of the American Jewish establishment
is fake.
To sustain their uncritical brand of Zionism, therefore, America's Jewish organizations will need to look elsewhere to
replenish their ranks. They will need to find young American. Jews who have come of age during the West Bank
occupation but are not troubled by it. And those young American Jews will come disproportionately from the
Orthodox world.
Because they marry earlier, intermarry less, and have more children, Orthodox Jews are growing rapidly as a share of the
American Jewish population. According to a 2006 American Jewish Committee (AJC) survey, while Orthodox Jews make
up only 12 percent of American Jewry over the age of sixty, they constitute 34 percent between the ages of eighteen and
twenty-four. For America's Zionist organizations, these Orthodox youngsters are a potential bonanza. In their yeshivas
they learn devotion to Israel from an early age; they generally spend a year of religious study there after high school, and
often know friends or relatives who have immigrated to Israel. The same AJC study found that while only 16 percent of
non-Orthodox adult Jews under the age of forty feel ""very close to Israel,"" among the Orthodox the figure is 79 percent. As
secular Jews drift away from America's Zionist institutions, their Orthodox counterparts will likely step into the breach. The
Orthodox ""are still interested in parochial Jewish concerns,"" explains Samuel Heilman, a sociologist at the City University
of New York. ""They are among the last ones who stayed in the Jewish house, so they now control the lights.""
But it is this very parochialism—a deep commitment to Jewish concerns, which often outweighs more universal ones—
that gives Orthodox Jewish Zionism a distinctly illiberal cast. The 2006 AJC poll found that while 60 percent of non-
Orthodox American Jews under the age of forty support a Palestinian state, that figure drops to 25 percent among the
Orthodox. In 2009, when Brandeis University's Theodore Sasson asked American Jewish focus groups about Israel, he
found Orthodox participants much less supportive of dismantling settlements as part of a peace deal. Even more tellingly,
Reform, Conservative, and unaffiliated Jews tended to believe that average Palestinians wanted peace, but had been ill-
served by their leaders. Orthodox Jews, by contrast, were more likely to see the Palestinian people as the enemy, and to
deny that ordinary Palestinians shared any common interests or values with ordinary Israelis or Jews.
Orthodox Judaism has great virtues, including a communal warmth and a commitment to Jewish learning unmatched in
the American Jewish world. (I'm biased, since my family attends an Orthodox synagogue.) But if current trends continue,
the growing influence of Orthodox Jews in America's Jewish communal institutions will erode even the liberal-democratic
veneer that today covers American Zionism. In 2002, America's major Jewish organizations sponsored a large Israel
solidarity rally on the Washington Mall. Up and down the east coast, yeshivas shut down for the day, swelling the
estimated Orthodox share of the crowd to close to 70 percent. When the then Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul
Wolfowitz told the rally that ""innocent Palestinians are suffering and dying as well,"" he was booed.
America's Jewish leaders should think hard about that rally. Unless they change course, it portends the future: an
American Zionist movement that does not even feign concern for Palestinian dignity and a broader American Jewish
population that does not even feign concern for Israel. My own children, given their upbringing, could as easily end up
among the booers as among Luntz's focus group. Either prospect fills me with dread.
In 2004, in an effort to prevent weapons smuggling from Egypt, Israeli tanks and bulldozers demolished hundreds of
houses in the Rafah refugee camp in the southern Gaza Strip. Watching television, a veteran Israeli commentator and
politician named Tommy Lapid saw an elderly Palestinian woman crouched on all fours looking for her medicines amid the
ruins of her home. He said she reminded him of his grandmother.
In that moment, Lapid captured the spirit that is suffocating within organized American Jewish life. To begin with, he
watched. In my experience, there is an epidemic of not watching among American Zionists today. A Red Cross study on
malnutrition in the Gaza Strip, a bill in the Knesset to allow Jewish neighborhoods to bar entry to Israeli Arabs, an Israeli
human rights report on settlers burning Palestinian olive groves, three more Palestinian teenagers shot—it's unpleasant.
Rationalizing and minimizing Palestinian suffering has become a kind of game. In a more recent report on how to foster
Zionism among America's young, Luntz urges American Jewish groups to use the word ""Arabs, not Palestinians,"" since
""the term `Palestinians' evokes images of refugee camps, victims and oppression,"" while ""Arab' says wealth, oil
and Islam.""
Of course, Israel—like the United States—must sometimes take morally difficult actions in its own defense. But they are
morally difficult only if you allow yourself some human connection to the other side. Otherwise, security justifies
everything. The heads of AIPAC and the Presidents' Conference should ask themselves what Israel's leaders would have
to do or say to make them scream ""no."" After all, Lieberman is foreign minister; Effi Eitam is touring American universities;
settlements are growing at triple the rate of the Israeli population; half of Israeli Jewish high school students want Arabs
barred from the Knesset. If the line has not yet been crossed, where is the line?
What infuriated critics about Lapid's comment was that his grandmother died at Auschwitz. How dare he defile the
memory of the Holocaust? Of course, the Holocaust is immeasurably worse than anything Israel has done or ever will do.
•
But at least Lapid used Jewish suffering to connect to the suffering of others. In the world of AIPAC, the Holocaust
analogies never stop, and their message is always the same: Jews are licensed by their victimhood to worry only about
themselves. Many of Israel's founders believed that with statehood, Jews would rightly be judged on the way they treated
the non-Jews living under their dominion. ""For the first time we shall be the majority living with a minority,"" Knesset
member Pinchas Lavon declared in 1948, ""and we shall be called upon to provide an example and prove how Jews live
with a minority.""
But the message of the American Jewish establishment and its allies in the Netanyahu government is exactly the
opposite: since Jews are history's permanent victims, always on the knife-edge of extinction, moral responsibility is a
luxury Israel does not have. Its only responsibility is to survive. As former Knesset speaker Avraham Burg writes in his
remarkable 2008 book, The Holocaust Is Over; We Must Rise From Its Ashes, ""Victimhood sets you free.""
This obsession with victimhood lies at the heart of why Zionism is dying among America's secular Jewish young. It simply
bears no relationship to their lived experience, or what they have seen of Israel's. Yes, Israel faces threats from Hezbollah
and Hamas. Yes, Israelis understandably worry about a nuclear Iran. But the dilemmas you face when you possess
dozens or hundreds of nuclear weapons, and your adversary, however despicable, may acquire one, are not the
dilemmas of the Warsaw Ghetto. The year 2010 is not, as Benjamin Netanyahu has claimed, 1938. The drama of Jewish
victimhood—a drama that feels natural to many Jews who lived through 1938, 1948, or even 1967—strikes most of
today's young American Jews as farce.
But there is a different Zionist calling, which has never been more desperately relevant. It has its roots in Israel's
Independence Proclamation, which promised that the Jewish state ""will be based on the precepts of liberty, justice and
peace taught by the Hebrew prophets,"" and in the December 1948 letter from Albert Einstein, Hannah Arendt, and others
to The New York Times, protesting right-wing Zionist leader Menachem Begin's visit to the United States after his party's
militias massacred Arab civilians in the village of Deir Yassin. It is a call to recognize that in a world in which Jewish
fortunes have radically changed, the best way to memorialize the history of Jewish suffering is through the ethical use of
Jewish power.
For several months now, a group of Israeli students has been traveling every Friday to the East Jerusalem neighborhood
of Sheikh Jarrah, where a Palestinian family named the Ghawis lives on the street outside their home of fifty-three years,
from which they were evicted to make room for Jewish settlers. Although repeatedly arrested for protesting without a
permit, and called traitors and self-haters by the Israeli right, the students keep coming, their numbers now swelling into
the thousands. What if American Jewish organizations brought these young people to speak at Hillel? What if this was the
face of Zionism shown to America's Jewish young? What if the students in Luntz's focus group had been told that their
generation faces a challenge as momentous as any in Jewish history: to save liberal democracy in the only Jewish state
on earth?
""Too many years I lived in the warm embrace of institutionalized elusiveness and was a part of it,"" writes Avraham Burg. ""I
was very comfortable there."" I know; I was comfortable there too. But comfortable Zionism has become a moral
abdication. Let's hope that Luntz's students, in solidarity with their counterparts at Sheikh Jarrah, can foster an
uncomfortable Zionism, a Zionism angry at what Israel risks becoming, and in love with what it still could be. Let's hope
they care enough to try.

Chomsky Barred From West Bank by Israel
By ROBERT MACKEY
Noam Chomsky, an American linguist and political thinker who has been critical of Israel, was denied entry into the West
Bank on Sunday by Israeli immigration officials when he tried to cross into the Palestinian territory from Jordan to deliver a
lecture.
Amira Hass of the Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported:
No reason was initially given for the decision, but the Interior Ministry later said immigration officials at the Allenby Bridge
border crossing from Jordan had misunderstood Chomsky's intentions thinking initially he was also due to visit Israel.
Chomsky, who is on a speaking tour in the region, was scheduled to speak at Bir Zeit University in the West Bank on
Monday.
A spokeswoman for Israel's interior ministry also told Reuters that there had been a misunderstanding and ""officials were
trying to get clearance from the Israeli military, which controls access to the West Bank to allow Chomsky to enter.""
In a television interview from Amman, Jordan, after he was rebuffed, Mr. Chomsky told Al Jazeera English, ""the facts were
completely clear to everyone; there was no basis for a misunderstanding."" He explained that he was interrogated for
several hours before being told that he would not be allowed to cross into the occupied Palestinian territory. The 81-year-
old scholar added:
I can only say what was conveyed to me in the discussion with the official who was carrying out the interrogation — he
was receiving instructions from the [Israeli] ministry of interior and relaying them. There were two basic points. One was
that the government of Israel does not like the kinds of things I say — which puts them into the category of I suppose
every other government in the world. The second was that they seemed upset about the fact that I was just taking an
invitation from Bir Zeit and I had no plans to go on to speak in Israeli universities, as I have done many times in the past
but not this time.
Mr. Chomsky had been invited to speak about American foreign and domestic policy by the philosophy department at the
Palestinian university in Ramallah.
The renowned linguist was outspoken in his opposition to the Israeli offensive in Gaza, which ended in January 2009 and
has criticized Israel's occupation of Palestinian territory many times.
In an interview with Deborah Solomon of The New York Times Magazine in 2003, Mr. Chomsky said, ""I objected to the
founding of Israel as a Jewish state. I don't think a Jewish or Christian or Islamic state is a proper concept. I would object
to the United States as a Christian state."" When Ms. Solomon pressed Mr. Chomsky on his opposition to Israel, saying,
""Your father was a respected Hebraic scholar, and sometimes you sound like a self-hating Jew,"" he replied:
It is a shame that critics of Israeli policies are seen as either anti-Semites or self-hating Jews. It's grotesque. If an Italian
criticized Italian policies, would he be seen as a self-hating Italian?

Hope you're both well. The DVD screener should arrive at Huma's sometime this morning.
I can't wait for to hear what you think of the film and, if you have the time, how we can strengthen themes and sections
to make it a more relevant and effective educational and policy influencing tool. We are currently at various stages of
reaching out or building partnerships with a wide variety of organizations from Facing History and Ourselves to JStreet to
the Marine Corps to the United Nations
(informally) to various think tanks, and human rights organizations.
We have big plans for the film and hope to use it as a platform to foster critical cross-cultural conversations.

to request proof of migratory status. They do this in practice routinely. Frequently, individuals who cannot
prove legal status are referred to INM (federal CBP-equivalent). In practice, GoM authorities at all levels
engage in exploitative treatment of migrants, primarily Central Americans heading to the US. These abuses

Nelson to back 'Don't ask' repeal
By: Jen DiMascio
May 26, 2010 12:08 PM EDT
Nebraska Sen. Ben Nelson (D) will back repeal of don't ask don't tell, likely putting repeal proponents over the top in
their quest to end the ban on gays serving openly in the military.
""I don't believe that most Nebraskans want to continue a policy that not only encourages but requires people to be
deceptive and to lie. The 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' policy does just that,"" Nelson said. ""It also encourages suspicion and
senior officers to look the other way. In a military which values honesty and integrity, this policy encourages deceit.""
""I will support the Lieberman compromise because it removes politics from the process. It bases implementation of the
repeal on the Pentagon's review and a determination by our military leaders that repeal is consistent with military
readiness and effectiveness, and that the Pentagon has prepared the necessary regulations to make the changes,"" he
said, adding that he spoke with Defense Secretary Robert Gates about the issue.
""He advised that while he preferred waiting until the study is completed, he can live with this compromise,"" Nelson said.
Given statements made by Sens. Evan Bayh (D-Ind.), Bill Nelson (D-Fla.) and Susan Collins (R-Maine) that they, too, will
vote for repeal, Nebraska's Nelson would be the critical 15th vote required for repeal to be included in the defense
authorization bill.
Their decisions were also made after earlier news this week that both the White House and Gates could live with a
compromise amendment sponsored by Sens. Joe Lieberman (I-Conn.), Carl Levin (D-Mich.) and Rep. Patrick Murphy (D-
Pa.).
""We thank Senator Nelson for his support and are extremely grateful. He and other senators supporting repeal will be
on the right side of history,"" said Joe Solmonese, president of the Human Rights Campaign. ""While Senator Nelson's vote
is critical, no vote will be taken for granted in these final hours before the Senate committee vote.""","['Nebraska', 'Nebraska']"

FISA director leaves legacy of collaboration
Breaking down barriers
Wednesday, May 26, 2010
By Tina Calabro, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette
Pam Panchak/Post-Gazette
FISA Foundation retiring executive director Dee Delaney, left, with the new executive director,
Kristy Trautmann.
To people in the local disability community, Dee Delaney is a household name.
When news came this spring of her intention to retire as executive director of FISA Foundation in
August, one could almost hear a collective gasp. With 14 years at the helm of the small but
influential foundation, Ms. Delaney has had a pronounced and lasting influence on quality of life in
our region.
On behalf of FISA, Ms. Delaney has changed the local landscape not only by funding projects with
far-reaching results, but by bringing people together to craft solutions to longstanding problems and
by becoming personally involved in many of the projects the foundation funds.
She became the first executive director of FISA Foundation when it began in 1996 with proceeds
from the sale of Hannarville Rehabilitation Center, a nonprofit, to HealthSouth, a for-profit
organization.
The new foundation would continue the mission of the Federation of Independent School Alumnae,
an organization that opened a convalescent home for women in 1911 and the Harmarville
Rehabilitation Center in 1954. That mission was to improve the lives of women, girls and people
with disabilities in Western Pennsylvania.
Ms. Delaney, who had been involved with Harmarville since 1980 -- starting as a volunteer and
ending as development director of its foundation -- sought the job of leading FISA. ""I realized the
impact the foundation could have. FISA is not a large foundation, but it's a very focused
foundation,"" she said.
Over the past 14 years, FISA's endowment has grown to more than $38 million. Over $17 million
has been granted to 726 projects in 298 organizations.
A roll call of projects funded by FISA reflects progressive thinking about including of people with
disabilities in all aspects of life, especially access to health care. Programs have become national
models.
Women with disabilities, for example, often encounter barriers in typical healthcare settings.
Standard exam tables and diagnostic equipment were designed for the able-bodied, and medical
staff often struggle to accommodate individuals with special needs. FISA provided the seed money
for the Center for Women with Disabilities at Magee-Womens Hospital of UPMC, one of the first
such clinics in the nation. FISA is involved in the overall issue of improving access to healthcare
for people with disabilities.
Likewise, people with disabilities have difficulty obtaining dental care. A FISA-funded project at
Achieva is creating statewide, systemic solutions. FISA also provided support for the Center for
Patients with Special Needs at Pitt's School of Dental Medicine.
FISA has also taken the lead on training arts and cultural venues how to make events more
accessible and helping places of worship more welcoming
""Dee is a national leader in the field. If there were more people like her, we wouldn't have the
issues we have,"" said Kim Hutchinson, executive director of the Disability Funders Network, based
in Virginia. Ms. Delaney has been a board officer for the group since 2004.
Nancy Murray, president of the ARC of Greater Pittsburgh, said the issues Ms. Delaney has helped
solve are ones that people have been working on for years.
""People talk about strategies, but never move forward to solutions. Dee brings all the stakeholders
together to get to the solutions,"" said Ms. Murray.
""I think Dee has greatly influenced the next generation of nonprofit and philanthropic leaders,
leading by example on the value of true collaboration,"" said Susie Chase, a board member of FISA
and former executive director of Working Order, a FISA grantee.
""With Dee, it is never about her own role, or FISA's role, it is always about unmet needs in the
community and the work that needs to be done. That seems to bring out the best in every partner,
and in everyone who has the privilege of working with her.""
Ms. Chase added that advice and technical assistance Ms. Delaney provided to Working Order
""were of equal or greater value to the organization than the grant funds.""
""I still, after many years, never come away from a meeting with Dee that I haven't learned
something, been inspired to work harder, and understood more clearly the value of someone else's
ideas and efforts.""
In her retirement, Ms. Delaney plans to ""give back to the community in new ways,"" she said. A
new frontier is helping young people with disabilities prepare for employment and leadership. ""We
have to keep the fire burning.""
On May 19, FISA announced that Kristy Trautmaim, who has served as the foundation's program
director for six years, was promoted to executive director.
""We sought a person who would follow Ms. Delaney's visionary leadership and guide the
foundation into the next decade,"" said Jane Burger, who chaired the search committee. ""We know
that we have found such a person in Kristy Trautmaim. She understands the challenges facing the
populations the foundation supports and has the trust of the board and the community.""","['Western', 'Pennsylvania', 'Virginia']"

A new Buffalo Bill is catching the world's attention.
On the practice field Tuesday afternoon, he was just another Bill, a rookie no less, but he's
catching a lot of attention in his family's homeland.
In China this week, during a speech to dignitaries at the USA Pavilion, Secretary of State Hillary
Clinton said this:
""From Yo-Yo Ma to I.M. Pei to Commerce Secretary Gary Locke and Energy Secretary Chu,
Chinese-Americans have achieved great success in business, government, the arts, sciences and
sports. And to that end, I was pleased to hear that the Buffalo Bills have recently drafted the
first Chinese-American to play in the NFL,"" said Clinton.
Buffalo Bills offensive tackle Ed Wang said, ""It felt good. She's a very important person, and so
for someone like that to talk about me, it just feels good.""
Wang didn't know until he heard from News 4 that he was mentioned in Shanghai. The 6'5"", 250
pound Bills rookie wasn't born in China, but both of his parents were Chinese Olympians in track
and field, so he loves breaking new ground in football.
>»In George's reporter's notebook, he explains why the Buffalo Bills limit media access to the
first 15 minutes of practice
""It is important to me just because I am the first, and I take a lot of pride in being Chinese, but
at the same time, I know that I'm out here to play football,"" said Wang.

Unfortunately, they give it a horrible title, but I think the piece turned out alright.
Best, Sandy
By Samuel R. Berger
Samuel R. Berger, chair of the global strategy firm Albright Stonebridge Group, served as national security advisor to
President Clinton from 1997 to 2001.
President Obama's National Security Strategy, released by the White House on Thursday, tackles a delicate but
unavoidable question: How do we respond to new and old security challenges in an era of financial distress at home and
a reordering of political power abroad?
For some time now, it has been clear that the definition of U.S. national security strategy needs rethinking. The
September 11 attacks, global economic crisis, cyber-terror threats and even the environmental catastrophe in the Gulf
underscore that the challenges America faces in 2010 have changed even from just a decade ago. And while America's
military supremacy is certainly not at risk, new international arrangements - such as the shift from the G-7 club of
powerful nations to the G-20, which incorporates emerging nations from China to Brazil - are needed so that the costs
and benefits of a stable international order are shared. The United States cannot solve most global threats without
others, nor should we bear the burden alone.
Enter the National Security Strategy. In my experience, these congressionally mandated documents can easily become
laborious and impenetrable, or mere compendiums of bureaucratic pleading from various parts of the government.
(Make sure you do right by Japan! Don't step on the Pentagon!) The challenge, which President Clinton insisted upon to
me and his other advisers, is to provide a strategic framework that is clarifying to the rest of the world and informs
administration decision makers up and down the line. It's not a blueprint for action, but a means to convey the
president's principles and priorities.
In Obama's case, the new sober and comprehensive 52-page strategy incorporates the new realities and breaks with
past strategies in several key respects. But it also reflects an understanding that we face enduring challenges - nuclear
proliferation, terrorism and regional conflicts - for which the best response is a return to fundamentals.
One such fundamental is the strength of our economy. At a time when the after-effects of a financial crisis and the fiscal
burden of two long wars have raised fears of an overextended America, the administration makes a case for economic
and technological renewal as a crucial underpinning of U.S. security. The president made this case in his West Point
speech last weekend. ""At no time in human history,"" he said, ""has a nation of diminished economic vitality maintained
its military and political primacy.""
Another fundamental challenge is arms control and nuclear proliferation. By seeking strategic arms cuts with Russia, the
president has returned to a long bipartisan tradition that languished during the prior administration. And by convening a
global summit on securing nuclear material this spring, Obama has given new urgency and global purchase to the effort
started in 1991 when Sens. Sam Nunn and Richard Lugar first initiated a program to lock down nuclear materials.
On terrorism, the strategy builds on the past, but breaks with it as well. Presidents Clinton, Bush and Obama each have
deployed all of America's tools: military power, homeland defense, law enforcement, sanctions, intelligence and
vigorous efforts to cut off terrorist financing. But the critical difference in the Obama strategy is that it rejects the Global
War on Terror lens through which the prior administration viewed the challenge. ""This is not a global war against a tactic
- terrorism - or a religion - Islam,"" the new strategy says. ""We are at war with a specific network, al-Qaeda and its
terrorist affiliates.""
This sharper focus avoids alienating many in the Muslim world, ensures the support of key allies who never accepted the
broader construct and avoids the overreactions that led us to forsake the fight against al-Qaeda fight in Afghanistan and
turn our efforts to the unrelated threat from Saddam Hussein's Iraq.
In perhaps the most dramatic departure from the strategy of its predecessor, the Obama administration has restored a
less provocative policy on the use of military force. In the 2002 national security strategy, President Bush articulated the
rationale for preemptive war just weeks before seeking a U.N. resolution to invade Iraq. The new strategy restores the
principles that have guided administrations for decades: the use of force should be a last resort, should weigh all the
costs and benefits, and should have as much international support as possible. The administration reserves the right to
act unilaterally - for example against al-Qaeda and its allies - but resurrects the principle President Clinton often
described as ""together where possible, alone where necessary.""
President Obama's critics have focused on his diplomatic engagement with hostile states like Iran and North Korea. The
President sets forth his rationale: ""to create opportunities to resolve differences, strengthen the international
community's support for our actions, learn about the intentions and nature of closed regimes, and plainly demonstrate
to the public within those nations that their governments are to blame for their isolation.""
In the case of Iran, Washington's outstretched hand has not resulted in Iran's compliance. But attempts to engage have
helped ensure that the world's attention is focused on Iran's intransigence rather than Washington's refusal to
negotiate.
Without a doubt, there are gaps between principle and practice. Despite the Obama administration's stated goal of
doubling exports in the next five years, it has not put its muscle behind trade agreements with South Korea, Panama and
Colombia. And the clarity of its call to respect human rights has at times been muted in the face of tough realities.
Sixteen months into this administration there has been much progress, but many of the true tests of this strategy lie
ahead.
In the strategy's conclusions, the Obama administration evokes an even earlier era, calling for both political parties to
restore the cooperation and common purpose so crucial to our success during the dark days of the Cold War. Despite
the intense debates at the time over nuclear arms control, Central America and détente, nearly all American supported
the containment of communism.
In that same spirit, the administration's framework deserves broad bipartisan support. We can and should argue out our
differences over detention of prisoners, methods to disarm dangerous states, how hard to push for democratic rights, or
the costs of climate change legislation. But at the same time, we can rally around the overriding U.S. foreign policy goals
spelled out in the strategy: renewing our economy at home to ensure leadership abroad; defeating al-Qaeda; succeeding
in Afghanistan; preventing nuclear proliferation; curbing climate change; and promoting an international order of
enlightened self-interest, economic prosperity and the fundamental values upon which America is based.","['U.S.', 'Gulf', 'America', 'China', 'Brazil', 'United', 'States', 'Japan', 'America', 'U.S.', 'West', 'Point', 'Russia', 'America', 'Afghanistan', 'Iraq', 'Iraq', 'Iran', 'North', 'Korea', 'Iran', 'Washington', 'Iran', 'Iran', 'Washington', 'South', 'Korea', 'Panama', 'Colombia', 'Central', 'America', 'U.S.', 'Afghanistan', 'America']"

Benzion has constantly criticized him in public for his deviations from the doctrine of Greater Israel. Bibi desperately seeks

Bush administration did for the Lebanon and Gaza incursions. Be prepared.
Further: Of course, the consequences for US foreign policy and national security are negative across the board: from the
analogy of the North Korean ship sinking and the Chinese posture to support for Iranian sanctions, etc., etc. Did the
Israelis not hear Petraeus's testimony?
Further: Of course, whatever the outcome of such a raid, one of the inevitable ones would be the death of the peace
process, such as it is, on the very eve of Bibi's scheduled visit to Obama, which would have been, under any
circumstance, in light of the raid, profoundly humiliating for the president. Or are the Israelis bone stupid? I don't think so.

In a controversial interview with Israel's Channel II News, the father of Prime Minister Netanyahu, Professor Benzion
Netanyahu, says that his son does not support a Palestinian state. The elder Netanyahu, claims that the prime Minister
told him he deliberately placed impossible conditions before the Palestinians.
Here are excerpts from the interview. When asked if his son really changed his position concerning a Palestinian state,
the 100 year-old historian unequivocally answered: (translation mine)
""He does not support. He supports such conditions that they (the Arabs) will never accept it. That is what I
heard from him. I didn't propose these conditions, he did. They will never accept these conditions. Not
one of them.""
When asked about his own personal opinion about a Palestinian state, the senior Netanyahu stated:
Herzl and Nordau (fathers of zionist movement) did not labor to create a Palestinian state. This land is
Jewish land and not a land for the Arabs. There is no place here for Arabs, and there wont be a place
here for the Arabs. They will never agree to the conditions.

Netanyahu Visits Grave of Brother Who Fell in
Entebbe Rescue
by Tzvi Ben Gedalyahu
Follow Israel news on 4nd
On Saturday night, Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu visited the grave of his brother Yoni, who fell during the daring
rescue of hijacked Israelis in Entebbe, Uganda in 1976.
He and his wife Sarah decided to go to the gravesite on Mount Herzl 24 hours before the beginning of Remembrance Day
for Fallen Soldiers in order to prevent security tie-ups for thousands of other Israelis who will visit the cemetery Sunday
night and Monday.
The Netanyahus were moved emotionally after seeing for the first time a commemorative decoration that the IDF carved
into the gravestone of Yoni, who led the rescue operation and was the only soldier to die in the maneuver. One of his less
known heroic deeds is his saving a soldier from across Syrian lines in the Yom Kippur War in 1973.
Sirens will sound throughout Israel for one minute at 8 p.m. (1 p.m. EDT) Sunday night to mark the beginning of Memorial
Day for 22,682 Fallen Soldiers and 2,431 victims of Arab terrorist attacks following the re-establishment of the State of
Israel after 2,000 years. Another 1,500 civilians were killed between 1860 and the 1948 War for Independence, when
seven Arab nations attacked the fledging, newly declared state just three years after the Holocaust ended.
On Monday morning, a two-minute siren will sound at 11 a.m. (4 a.m. EDT).

5759,"H: this report appeared in Maariv, major Israeli daily, on May 27, fyi, SidNetanyahu pleased: I didn't capitulate
Ben Caspit, Maariv, May 27 2010 [page 2 with front page lead; Hebrew original here and at bottom of post]
In the course of intimate conversations over the past few weeks with top political officials and civil servants, Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu has said, according to his interlocutors, that he managed to defeat the US administration.
Netanyahu is pleased by the fact that the Americans failed, so he said, to twist his arm and that ultimately, in the duel between
him and the Obama administration, he was the one who emerged with the upper hand. We did not make concessions on our red
lines and they failed to make us fold and to drag us to places we didn't want to go, said Netanyahu, according to people who
heard him speak.
Netanyahu is convinced that he is not going to be forced to extend the settlement construction freeze, which is due to expire in
September. According to senior officials in Jerusalem, an agreement has already been reached with the administration that the
Israeli government will not announce an extension of the construction freeze in the territories, and the Americans will ""make
sure"" that the Palestinians do not withdraw from the talks. Israel, however, will not take ""aggressive"" action and construction
will be resumed only in areas that are clearly within the consensus inside the settlement blocs.
The Prime Minister 's Bureau vigorously denied the above report. ""The statements attributed to the prime minister are
incorrect,"" said a spokesman in the Prime Minister's Bureau. ""They were not said by Netanyahu in any forum. The reason is
simple: the prime minister does not think that, Prime Minister Netanyahu holds in great esteem the commitment by President
Obama and the administration to Israel's security and their efforts to renew the peace process in our region.""
Eli Bardenstein adds: The formal invitation that Netanyahu received yesterday to meet with President Obama next week might
attest to a radical change in the White House's attitude towards him. Political sources in Israel described the planned meeting
as ""the peak of the campaign for Israel and the Jews that has been pursued by the Obama administration in the past number of
weeks."" The sources said that the meeting was geared to put an end to the grave crisis that erupted some two months ago
between the Obama administration and Netanyahu over the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and particularly over the continued
construction in East Jerusalem, and to mend the mistaken impression that was received as if Israel was ""no longer an absolute
ally of the United States.""
That crisis, which was initiated by the Americans, elicited fierce criticism in the United States, and sparked a desire among
members of the Obama administration to rectib) the situation. Another reason for the administration's desire to end the crisis
is the fear offailure in the upcoming Congressional elections in November. ""The Democratic Party's coffers are empty.
Many Democrat members of Congress and Senators have complained that if the hazing of Israel were to continue, they
would be unable to obtain donations from Jews and were liable to lose the elections,"" said one source in Washington.
The prevalent assessment is that Netanyahu will be received far more warmly in Washington next week than he was two months
ago. This time the meeting will be covered by the media and the two leaders are expected to have their picture taken together
and to give statements to the media.
That said, sources in Washington noted that ""Netanyahu is leery of the meeting with Obama and of walking into a trap once
again. He knows that the smiles notwithstanding, behind closed doors he is going to have to give answers to very difficult
questions, like 'how do you envision the end of the negotiations with the Palestinians.'""
Netanyahu is to begin his political travels today in Paris, where he is to attend the ceremony in honor of Israel's acceptance
into the OECD. The prime minister will be arriving in a city that is on strike, which is liable to impede his movement through
the city streets to the center of Paris for his meetings.","['Maariv', 'US', 'Jerusalem', 'Israel', 'Israel', 'Israel', 'Israel', 'East', 'Jerusalem', 'Israel', 'United', 'States', 'United', 'States', 'Israel', 'Washington', 'Washington', 'Washington', 'Paris', 'Israel', 'Paris']"

The Unnecessary Fall
A counter-history of the Obama presidency.
• John B. Judis
• August 12, 2010 I 12:00 am
On April 14, 2009, as Barack Obama's standing in the polls was beginning to slip, and as Tea Party demonstrators were
amassing in Washington for tax day protests, the president gave a lengthy address atGeorgetown University explaining the
""five pillars"" of his economic policies. The speech was intended to promote a memorable slogan for Obama's program that
would evoke comparisons with Theodore Roosevelt's Square Deal, Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal, and Lyndon Johnson's
Great Society.
Obama's contribution was to be the New Foundation. ""We must lay a new foundation for growth and prosperity—a
foundation that will move us from an era of borrow and spend to one where we save and invest,"" he declared. Obama
would repeat the phrase seven times that day and on many more occasions over the next months. At Obama's private
White House dinner with presidential historians that June, the historians were no more impressed than the public with
the New Foundation as a slogan. ""I don't think it's going to work,"" Robert Dallek warned. Doris Kearns Goodwin said it
sounded ""like a woman's girdle.""
One of these historians might have been able to forewarn Obama that the slogan had been unsuccessfully deployed by a
Democratic president once before. In his 1979 State of the Union address, Jimmy Carter began, ""Tonight, I want to
examine in a broad sense the state of our American Union—how we are building a new foundation for a peaceful and a
prosperous world."" Carter would use the phrase five times in the speech, including in its conclusion, where he asked
members of Congress to join him ""in building that new foundation."" Like Obama's effort, the phrase inspired, at most, a
few underwear jokes and was then forgotten.
Obama's evocation of Carter was obviously unintended—but the Man from Plains is indeed the specter now hanging over
his presidency. Of course, Obama has already accomplished more in his first 20 months than Jimmy Carter did during his
entire presidency. But there is a disturbing political resemblance between the two presidencies. Both men ran inspired
campaigns in which they positioned themselves above the scandals and partisan quarrels of their predecessors and
initially stirred hopes of a ""transformational"" presidency. But, as presidents, both men somehow failed to connect with
large parts of the electorate.
To be sure, there are a number of very specific reasons why Carter and Obama landed in political trouble. Both men
contended with rising unemployment—Carter with rampant inflation as well—and voters' approval of a president and his
party tend to track closely with changes in the economy. Carter faced friction in his own party and the rise of a powerful
business lobby, and Obama has dealt with a Republican Party that has frustrated his dreams of a post-partisan presidency.
Yet the most important reason for their difficulties—evident in their inept attempts to brand their programs—has been an
inability to develop a politics that resonates with the public.
In the United States, politics pivots around the allegiance of the middle class, even as its identity has changed from
yeoman farmers and mechanics to store clerks, office workers, x-ray technicians, and small business owners. They are, in
Bill Clinton's words, ""those who work hard and play by the rules."" They are the central characters in a populist rhetoric
that goes back to the early republic. It depicts the middle class as embattled and threatened either from forces below
(impoverished immigrants, welfare cheaters, ghetto rioters) or above (Wall Street speculators, state bureaucrats, K Street
lobbyists). Populism can be embraced by Glenn Beck or Tom Harkin. It is intrinsically neither left-wing nor right-wing.
Politicians, such as Franklin Roosevelt or Ronald Reagan, who found a way of using populism's appeal during downturns
have enjoyed success, while those who have spurned it have suffered accordingly. If, in circumstances like the present one,
you don't develop a populist politics, your adversaries will use populism to define you as an enemy of the people. That's
what Carter discovered during the stagflation of the late '70s. And that's what has happened in the last 20 months of the
Great Recession to Barack Obama and to the Democratic Party he leads.
Obama took office with widespread popular support, even among Republicans, and some of his first efforts, including the
$800 billion stimulus, initially enjoyed strong public favor. But that wide appeal began to dissipate by the late spring of
2009. Disillusion with Obama fueled the November defeat of Democratic gubernatorial candidates in New Jersey and
Virginia. By January 2010, it was a crucial factor in Republican Scott Brown's astonishing victory over Martha Coakley in
Massachusetts.
In the postmortem debate over these defeats, some Democrats have blamed Obama's dogged pursuit of health care reform
while the economy was hemorrhaging jobs. That may have been a factor, but the real damage was done earlier. What
doomed Obama politically was the way he dealt with the financial crisis in the first six months of his presidency. In an
atmosphere primed for a populist backlash, he allowed the right wing to define the terms.
As Obama was delivering his inaugural address, the financial crisis was already in full swing; and it was already apparent
that financial speculation, outright fraud, and irresponsible and sometimes illegal housing-loan practices had played a
very large role in precipitating the crisis. The public was up in arms. But, instead of rallying the public against the ""money
changers,"" as Roosevelt had done in his first inaugural, Obama, taking a leaf from Jimmy Carter's infamous ""malaise""
speech, put the blame on the public as a whole. ""Our economy is badly weakened, a consequence of greed and
irresponsibility on the part of some, but also our collective failure to make hard choices and prepare the nation for a new
age,"" he declared.
Over the next month, Obama would periodically criticize bankers after embarrassing revelations—at various times calling
the bonuses they gave themselves ""shameful"" and an ""outrage""—but, after hearing complaints about his rhetoric from the
bankers, he would back off. At a private meeting on March 28 with 13 Wall Street CEOs, the president, his spokesman
Robert Gibbs said, ""emphasized that Wall Street needs Main Street and Main Street needs Wall Street."" And, in his
Georgetown speech, Obama returned to his theme of collective responsibility. The recession, Obama said, ""was caused by
a perfect storm of irresponsibility and poor decision-making that stretched from Wall Street to Washington to Main
Street.""
Obama's policy followed the same swerving course as his rhetoric. One week, he would favor harsh restrictions on bank
and insurance-company bonuses, but, the next week, he would waver; one week, he would support legislation allowing
bankruptcy judges to reduce the amount that homeowners threatened with foreclosure owed the banks; the next week, he
would fail to protest when bank lobbyists pressured the Senate to kill these provisions. But, more importantly, Obama—in
sharp contrast to Roosevelt in his first months—failed to push Congress to immediately enact new financial regulations or
even to set up a commission to investigate fraud. (When Congress finally appointed a commission in July 2009, Obama
and his party put a milquetoast Democratic politician, former California State Treasurer Philip Angelides, in charge of it.)
Obama's appointments also conveyed an impression that he wanted to let Wall Street off the hook. He appointed Timothy
Geithner to be treasury secretary. Geithner claimed that he was not part of Wall Street, but, in his capacity as president of
the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, he had served under a board of directors headed by JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie
Dimon. As New York Fed president, Geithner had been partly responsible for the decision to let Lehman Brothers go
under, for the unpopular tarp program, and for American International Group (MG) paying back its Wall Street creditors
with government money. Geithner chose as his chief of staff a former lobbyist for Goldman Sachs. Retiring Democratic
Senator Byron Dorgan told me, ""Most Americans were reading about the massive compensations and bailouts, and the
administration largely hired people from the culture of Wall Street.""
By the spring, Obama's apparent tilt to Wall Street had sparked a right-wing populist revolt in the country. The newly
formed Tea Party movement, Beck and Fox News, and a host of right-wing bloggers were leading the charge; but, in a less
extreme form, the general public shared their anger. In an early April New York Times/CBS News poll, the public
disapproved of Obama's aiding the banks by 58 percent to 33 percent. In this same poll, public approval of Obama's
handling of the economy began to fall. Pollsters who did focus groups also traced disillusionment with Obama's economic
policies to his handling of the financial crisis.
Congressman Barney Frank, who defends Obama's policies, acknowledges that the president's political difficulties began
with the revelation that MG, which had received $170 billion from the government, had paid out $165 billion in bonuses
to the division that had brought the company down. Geithner had known about the bonuses but insisted there were no
legal grounds to block them. (It then came out that Geithner had pressured Senate Banking Committee Chairman Chris
Dodd to insert a provision in the stimulus bill that protected the bonuses.) ""The pitchforks were out. It added injury to
injury,"" Frank says. That's when public opinion of Geithner plummeted. According to a Rasmussen poll, 24 percent had a
favorable view of Geithner and 44 percent an unfavorable one.
The public's view of the bank bailout and the AIG bonuses colored its view of the auto bailout, the stimulus, and health
care reform. One of the rallying cries for the populist opposition to Obama was ""where's my bailout?"" (Obama himself
acknowledged that it was ""one of the most frequent questions"" he was asked in letters.) The auto program became a
bailout for the Big Three CEOs; the stimulus became a bailout of government itself; and health care reform was a bailout
for the uninsured—or ""reparations,"" as Rush Limbaugh put it. Wrote right-wing blogger Michelle Malkin, ""hardworking
citizens were getting sick of being played for chumps"" by ""moochers, big and small, corporate and individual, trampling
over themselves with their hands out demanding endless bailouts."" Obama and the Democrats were successfully portrayed
as aiding ""the moochers,"" but not the ""hardworking citizens."" In American politics, that's a recipe for political disaster.
Some in the White House political operation recognized in the late spring that the administration's economic efforts were
being defined by right-wing populism and tried to push Obama to take a more populist tack. A group within the White
House began calling themselves the ""pitchfork gang,"" but they would find their attempts to convince Obama to get tough
on Wall Street or on insurance companies undermined by Geithner and by National Economic Council head Larry
Summers, who were worried about upsetting business confidence. ""There was a continual tension in the White House,""
says a person who was privy to the discussions. ""One week, we would be very hot, and then, the next week, we would dial it
back.""
By early January of this year, Obama was clearly losing the battle for the middle class. According to a CNN poll, 60 percent
of Americans thought Obama ""had paid more attention to the problems faced by banks and other financial institutions""
than to the ""problems faced by middle class Americans."" Only 28 percent, barely more than a quarter, thought he had paid
more attention to the middle class. As Brown surged ahead of Coakley in the polls, the White House temporarily embraced
a populist approach. On January 14, Obama called the bank bonuses ""obscene"" and said, ""we want our money back."" In a
January 22 speech at Lorain County Community College in Elyria, Ohio (a far cry from Georgetown), Obama used the
word ""fighting"" 13 times and ""fight"" nine times. ""I will not stop fighting for you,"" he declared.
But, faced with a falling stock market and anger from Wall Street, Obama once again turned conciliatory. On February io,
he said that he didn't ""begrudge"" the $17 million bonus awarded to Dimon and the $9 million to Goldman Sachs CEO
Lloyd Blankfein. ""I know both guys. They are very savvy businessmen.""
Obama's reluctance to rail against Wall Street might have led to a watered-down financial reform bill, or even no bill at all,
but, on April 16, the Securities and Exchange Commission indicted Goldman Sachs for fraud. The next week, an
emboldened Obama went to New York to criticize the bankers directly for their ""failure of responsibility."" As a result of the
indictment and Obama's rediscovery of his anger, Republicans became somewhat less obstructionist, moderate
Republicans broke with the party's leadership, and moderate Democrats fell into line. Congress produced a much stronger
bill than the Democrats had ever expected.
But Obama's embrace of populism has remained fitful and sporadic. After the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Verizon's
Ivan Seidenberg, the head of the Business Roundtable, criticized Obama for being anti-business in June, the president
dispatched Geithner, White House aide Valerie Jarrett, and Bill Clinton to appease the business community. Obama has
said enough to anger the CEOs, but he has failed to convey to the greater public that he is fighting for them.
Obama's unwillingness to buck Wall Street and the Business Roundtable, along with his delayed and muddled response to
the BP disaster in the Gulf, has eroded the public's confidence in his leadership. In Pew's midyear report card on Obama's
image, the greatest drop from February 2009 to this June was in the perception of Obama as a ""strong leader."" Voters will
sometimes tolerate policies they question from presidents like John Kennedy or Reagan, whom they regard as ""strong,""
but not from politicians like Jimmy Carter, whom they regard as weak.
What of the other factors behind Obama's political difficulties? There is no doubt that, if the economy were growing faster,
and if unemployment were dropping below 9 percent, Obama and the Democrats would be more popular and not fearing a
November rout. But, unfortunately, the economy's sluggish recovery cannot be completely disentangled from the White
House's weak political performance.
In January, when the White House debated how large a stimulus to propose, Christina Romer, the head of the Council of
Economic Advisors, proposed a $1.2 trillion Keynesian jolt. David Obey, the chairman of the House Budget Committee,
told The Fiscal Times that Obama's Treasury Department asked initially for a $1.4 trillion bill. But the administration
finally proposed a stimulus between $700 and $800 billion that included large tax cuts that were more likely to stimulate
saving than consumption—and spending that would be unlikely to produce many jobs until the end of Obama's first term.
In the stimulus's first year, the administration spent only $17 billion of the $139 billion allocated for
infrastructure spending.
Prominent economists, including Paul Krugman and Joseph Stiglitz, made the case that a much larger stimulus was
necessary to reverse (rather than merely reduce) the rise in unemployment, and that, if a modest stimulus failed to reduce
unemployment, Republicans would convince the public that the stimulus was toxic medication and would block additional
Keynesian measures. That argument has been proven sadly correct. Some White House advisers appear to have
underestimated the depth of the Great Recession. Others seem to have doubted the administration had the political clout
to get more from Congress.
But the White House might have gotten more if Obama had proclaimed a national economic emergency (which it was);
framed the issue in terms of rescuing the middle class from damage done by Wall Street speculators, short-sighted CEOs,
and Chinese mercantilism; and directly attacked Republicans as heartless obstructionists. When Obama belatedly made
this sort of case on the eve of the financial reform vote this year, he got a much stronger bill than anyone had anticipated.
So it's not clear that the failure to get a larger stimulus—which has ended up hurting the administration politically—wasn't
itself a result of political timidity.
The president has also suffered from an inability to explain to the public why he sought such a large stimulus and what he
thought it could accomplish. Obama's New Foundation speech at Georgetown was soon forgotten. Afterward, Obama, to
the dismay of Democrats in Congress and some of his White House aides, pretty much dropped the jobs issue. From then
to Labor Day, he devoted a July visit to Buffalo and an August stopover in southern Indiana to the issue—at a time when
the right wing was mobilizing against him. Obama didn't just fail to develop a consistent narrative about the economy; he
didn't really try.
Contrast Obama's attempt to develop a politics to justify his economic program with what Reagan did in 1982. Faced with
steadily rising unemployment, which went from 8.6 percent in January to 10.4 percent in November, Reagan and his
political staff, which included James Baker, Mike Deaver, and Ed Rollins, forged a strategy early that year calling for
voters to ""stay the course"" and blaming the current economic troubles on Democratic profligacy. ""We are clearing away
the economic wreckage that was dumped in our laps,"" Reagan declared. Democrats accused them of playing ""the blame
game,"" but the strategy, followed to the letter by the White House for ten months, worked. The Republicans were
predicted to lose as many as 50 House seats, but they lost only 26 and broke even in the Senate.
Some commentators have noted Reagan's popularity was even lower than Obama's. But, on key economic questions, he
did much better than Obama and the Democrats are currently performing—and voters expressed far greater patience with
Reagan's program. According to polls, even as the unemployment rate climbed, a narrow plurality still expressed
confidence that Reagan's program would help the economy. On the eve of the election, with the unemployment rate at a
postwar high, a New York Times/CBS News poll found that 6o percent of likely voters thought Reagan's economic
program would eventually help the country. That's a sign of a successful political operation. If Obama could command
those numbers, Democrats could seriously limit their losses in November. But Obama has not been able to develop a
narrative that could convince people to trust him and the Democrats.
Why has the White House failed to convince the public that it is fighting effectively on its behalf? The principal culprit is
clearly Barack Obama. He has a strange aversion to confrontational politics. His aversion is strange because he was
schooled in it, working as a community organizer in the 198os, under the tutelage of activists who subscribed to teachings
of the radical Saul Alinsky. But, when Obama departed for Harvard Law School in 1988, he left Alinsky and adversarial
tactics behind.
The young lawyer who returned to Chicago and won a seat in the Illinois state Senate in 1996 practiced a very different
style of politics. Obama's principal accomplishments in Springfield were bills restricting lobbying and requiring
videotaping of confessions in potential death penalty cases. He was not a typical blue-collar, bread-and-butter Chicago
Democrat, but the kind of good government liberal that represents the upscale districts of the city, seeing in politics a
higher calling and ill at ease with (although not in open opposition to) the city's Democratic machine. He was also a post-
racial politician who eschewed the hard-edged, angry rhetoric of Jesse Jackson. (That, too, is oddly reminiscent of Carter,
who partly campaigned in 1976 as the white Southern antidote to George Wallace's angry racial populism.)
Obama carried this outlook into the U.S. Senate, into his campaign for the presidency, and then, into the presidency itself.
He is a cerebral, dispassionate, post-partisan; he wants to ""end the political strategy that has been based on division,"" to
""turn the page"" on the culture wars of the 1960s and the partisan battles of the 1990s. During the campaign, his aides
jokingly referred to him as the ""black Jesus."" While he can tolerate and even brush aside conflict, he is reluctant to actively
foment it. ""In a time of crisis, we can't afford to govern out of anger,"" he declared in February 2009. During his campaign
and his first year in office, he held to a blind faith in bipartisanship, even as the Republicans voted as a bloc against his
legislation. He is, perhaps, ill-suited in these respects for an era of bruising political warfare.
His advisers have clearly reinforced these inclinations. In the campaign, they fashioned him as the outsider candidate of
""hope"" and ""change"" and have extended this strategy into the presidency itself. They see him as standing above party. In a
meeting with congressional leaders last April, senior adviser David Axelrod rejected the complaint that Obama accorded
equal blame to Democrats and Republicans with his descriptions of the ""cynical politics in Washington."" Within the White
House, top aides still speak of promoting the Obama ""brand."" Organizing for America, the administration's campaign
organization, which is supposed to be focusing on the 2010 elections, recently devoted its resources to organizing parties
across the country to celebrate Obama's forty-ninth birthday.
These efforts to elevate Obama above the hurly-burly of Washington politics have been disastrous. Obama's image as an
iconic outsider has become the screen on which Fox News, the Tea Party, radicalright bloggers, and assorted politicians
have projected the image of him as a foreigner, an Islamic radical, and a socialist. He has remained ""the other"" that he
aspired to be during the campaign, but he and his advisers no longer control how that otherness is defined.
The White House and cabinet officials he appointed have reinforced his aversion to populism. As Jonathan Alter recounts
in The Promise: President Obama, Year One, Geithner and Summers repeatedly blocked attempts to get tough on Wall
Street on the grounds that doing so would threaten the recovery itself by upsetting the bankers. For most of his first year,
Alter writes, ""Obama bought the Geithner-Summers argument that the banks were fragile and couldn't be confronted
while they remained in peril."" Its reluctance to come down on the bankers crippled the administration politically, making
it far more difficult for it to get its way with Congress on a second stimulus program that would have boosted the recovery
and Democrats' political prospects. Bad politics can trump good policy.
Populism has profound shortcomings as a worldview. It tends toward demagoguery. In its relentless focus on the middle
class, it can ignore or stigmatize those below it. It can prove hostile to a long-range scientific outlook. A more populist
Obama, for instance, might have postponed the battle for climate change legislation or national health insurance and
probably would have taken a weaker stand on immigration. But populism has been an indelible part of the American
political psyche, and those who are uncomfortable making populist appeals, like Hoover or Carter—or, more recently,
presidential candidate John Kerry—suffer the consequences at the polls.
If Obama's politics leads to a Republican takeover of one or both houses of Congress, and even to a Republican president
in 2012, then much of what Obama has accomplished could be undone. It's unlikely that a new Republican president and
Congress would actually repeal the health care or the financial reform bill. But the former could be starved of public funds
and deprived of regulatory oversight; and the latter could be neutered by a hostile treasury secretary and by weak or
hostile presidential appointees to the Securities and Exchange Commission or the new Consumer Financial Protection
Agency. Reform legislation needs administrations and congresses committed to reform. That is where politics has to come
in; and that's where the Obama administration, with its aversion to populism, has fallen short.

ith a victory like this..
The direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians
have preconditions - dictated by Israel.
By At.tiye Elder: Tags: Israel news M:ddist East peace
Two years ago, a basketball tournament was held at Tel Aviv University with the participation of student teams from 14
cOuntries, including a Palestinian team from the occupied territories. The games were purportedly held ""without
preconditions,"" and every team put its best players on the court and aimed to win.
But unsurprisingly, the Shin Ben security service permitted only seven Palestinian players, including bench players, to
enter Israel. Some of the key players on the team were compelled to stay at home. After several losses (by 30 to 40
points), when it was the Palestinians turn to face a team from one of the Israeli colleges, their coach announced that he
had decided to spare his players another humiliation, and requested that the game be canceled.
The illuminating movie ""Friendship Games,"" to be shown tonight on the Yes Docu channel (directed by Ram Levy, along
with Ibtisam IVIara'ana, Duki Dror and Yoav Shamir), documents the tournament, which was the initiative of Ed Peskowitz,
an American Jew and co-owner of the Atlanta Hawks basketball team in the NBA. The camera follows the Israeli coach to
the Palestinian locker room. After a long while, he tells his players that in order to even out the teams, two of them will join
the other side. He tells two of the Israeli bench players, including one known as Fats(); to don the shirts of the Palestinian
team. The game ends with a decisive victory for the Israeli team and a strong sense of missed opportunity..
The direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians, like the basketball game, have preconditions. Not the
conditions demanded by the Palestinians, but conditions dictated by Israel. The refusal to freeze Israeli building in East
Jerusalem is a precondition, just like the demand to freeze it. The refusal to resume negotiations from the point where
talks between the previous prime minister, Ehud Olmert, and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas left off after the
Annapolis conference is no less a precondition than the demand to resume talks from square one.
The head referee, the president of the United States, has twisted the arms of his colleagues in the Quartet and is dragging
Abbas to Washington. Barack °barna decided that the negotiations will be held without any commitment regarding
building in East Jerusalem, and will be opened without even a declaration of principles stating that the talks will be held on
the basis of a general formula, like peace and security for Israel and a state along the 1967 borders for the Palestinians.
It's time to jump into the fountain in Rabin Square and cheer: The Palestinians have been shafted!
If Benjamin Netanyahu's aim is to play around as much as possible with the ball, and sometimes kick the opponent, then
he can really chalk up another victory. But Israel's success in the negotiations, like the success of the student team in the
tournament, is not measured by the terms ""victory"" or ""defeat."" What is victory over a weak Palestinian team worth, if it
was won in friendly games that ended with virtually no interaction between the participants? What is a political process
with the Palestinians worth if it erodes Abbas' standing and leads nowhere?
What have we to gain from humiliating our partner before his constituency on the way to the negotiating table? If Israel's
approach on every one of the core issues is that winning is everything, there's no point in bothering so many VIPs with
another unnecessary summit. Let's assume that we'll succeed, with the help of the Jewish power around Obama, to twist
Abbas' arm some more and extract, for example, an agreement in which he concedes sovereignty over the Temple
Mount. How many hours would such an agreement last?
All we need is a few more ""victories"" like the invitation to the launch of direct negotiations, ""without preconditions,"" and
we'll lose our last partners to a settlement that will prevent Israel from turning into an apartheid state or a Palestinian state
(the binational model is a nightmare, as far as I'm concerned).
What will we do if Abbas announces that he's had enough of losing in purportedly friendly games, and that he's decided
the time has come to step down? Will we declare another victory and invite Hamas leader Khaled Meshal and Iranian
president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to the party?

Editor's Note: The following is
the new epilogue from Max
Blumenthal's book, Republic
Gomorrah, now out in paperback
(Basic/Nation Books, 2009).
""He will tell you
that he wants a
strong authority to
take from him the
crushing
responsibility of
thinking for
himself Since the
Republic is weak,
he is led to break
the law out of love
for obedience. But
is it really strong
authority that he
wishes? In reality
he demands
rigorous order for
others, and for
himself disorder
without
responsibility."" --
Jean-Paul Sartre,
""Anti-Semite and
Jew""
I am not sure when I first detected
the noxious fumes that would
envelop the conservative
movement in the Obama era. It
might have been early on, in
April 2009, when I visited a
series of gun shows in rural
California and Nevada. Perusing
tables piled high with high-
caliber semi-automatic weapons
and chatting with anyone in my
vicinity, I heard urgent warnings
of mass roundups, concentration
camps, and a socialist
government in Washington.
""These people that are purchasing
these guns are people that are
worried about what's going on in
this country,"" a gun dealer told
me outside a show in Reno.
""Good luck Obama,"" a young gun
enthusiast remarked to me. ""We
outnumber him 100 to 1."" At this
time, the Tea Party movement
had not even registered on the
national media's radar.
In September 2009, I led a panel
discussion about this book inside
an auditorium filled with nearly
100 students and faculty at the
University of California-
Riverside. Beside me sat Jonathan
Walton, an African-American
professor of religious studies and
prolific writer, and Mark Takano,
an erudite, openly gay former
Democratic congressional
candidate and local community
college trustee. In the middle of
our discussion, a dozen College
Republicans stormed the front of
the stage with signs denouncing
me as a ""left-wing hack"" while a
hysterical young man leaped from
the crowd, blowing kisses
mockingly at Takano while
heckling Walton as a ""racist.""
Afterward, university police
officers insisted on escorting me
to my ride after the right-wing
heckler attempted to follow me as
he shouted threats.
Who was this stalker? Just a
concerned citizen worried about
taxes? His name was Ryan Sorba
and he was an operative of a
heavily funded national
conservative youth outfit, the
Intercollegiate Studies Institute.
Besides founding dozens of
Republican youth groups across
the country, Sorba has devoted an
exceptional amount of energy to
his interest in homosexuals. His
intellectual output consists of a
tract titled The Born Gay Hoax,
arguing that homosexuality is at
once a curable disease and a
bogus trend manufactured by
academic leftists. Adding to his
credentials, Sorba has a history of
run-ins with the law, he explained
when I called him about the
order.
My encounter with this
aggressive right-wing cadre
seemed a strange, isolated event.
But the hostility turned out to be
symptomatic of the intensifying
campaign to delegitimize
President Obama and his allies in
Congress. The Right's days of
rage were only beginning.
Through his first year in office,
Obama seemed oblivious to the
threat of the far right. He
campaigned against partisanship,
declaring that there were ""no red
states"" and no ""conservative
America."" Apparently, he thought
it was merely a contrivance or
myth that there were people who
rejected science, demonized gays,
assailed minority and women's
rights -- or that they genuinely
believed in what they said.
Speaking of changing
Washington, Obama seemed to
think that the entire history of
politics since the rise of Reagan
and the Right and their strategies
of polarization was not deeply
rooted but a superficial problem
attributable to certain ""divisive""
personalities, easily wiped away
with gestures toward
bipartisanship. His view of the
parties was that they were simply
mirror images sharing
fundamental beliefs but separated
by ""partisans."" The skilled and
devoted community organizer
could bring them together.
Many of his supporters in the
media, often part and parcel of
political wars over the years,
reinforced and amplified his
innocence, proclaiming he was
the one at last who could ""bridge•
the partisan divide."" Andrew
Sullivan, a disaffected
conservative who once called
critics of George W. Bush
policies ""fifth columnists"" but
now fervently supporting Obama,
wrote that the new president was
destined to become ""a liberal
Reagan who can reunite
America."" This optimism
pervaded the Obama White
House as the president and his
aides sought out Republicans
willing to vote for his programs.
After all, why couldn't we all just
get along?
In his autobiographical book The
Audacity of Hope, Obama
highlighted a key component of
his political strategy: ""I serve as a
blank screen on which people of
vastly different political stripes
project their own views."" Once he
was elected, conservatives
concluded that they could reverse
Obama's strength by transforming
him into a human tableau for the
most fearsome images they could
conjure.
Obama's multiracial background
was crucial in cultivating
resentment among the shock
troops. Those who rejected
Obama's legitimacy to serve as
president on the basis of his
background gave birth to the
""Birther"" movement that sought
to challenge his citizenship. The
movement's most visible figure,
and therefore the most eccentric,
was Orly Taitz, a dentist and self-
trained lawyer who had
immigrated from the former
Soviet republican of Moldova to
Israel before settling in the
conservative bastion of Orange
County, California. Convinced by
claims on the far-right Web site
WorldNetDaily that Obama
planned to create a ""civilian
national security force,"" Taitz
told me she ""realized that Obama
was another Stalin--it's a cross
between Stalinist USSR and
Hitler's Germany.""
After becoming transfixed by
online conspiracy theories
claiming Obama's family had
forged his birth certificate in
Hawaii, Taitz snapped into
action. She filed a lawsuit in
November 2008 with California
Secretary of State Debra Bowen
demanding an investigation into
Obama's eligibility to serve as
president. Taitz's plaintiff in the
case was Wiley Drake, an Orange
County radio preacher and former
second vice president of the
Southern Baptist Convention who
once publicly prayed for Obama's
death. While her lawsuit went
nowhere, and subsequent suits
earned her angry rebukes from
judges, Taitz became an instant
media sensation, delivering
heavily accented screeds against
Obama before friendly
interviewers from Sean Haimity
to CNN's Lou Dobbs, who Taitz
called her ""greatest supporter""
and who was eventually fired as
an indirect result of his hosting of
her.
In March 2009, Texas Rep.
Randy Neugebauer signed on to a
Birther bill proposing that future
presidential candidates must
prove their citizenship before
becoming eligible to campaign.
The Birther movement had found
its voice in goverment and made
an indelible impact on the
Republican grassroots. By June
2009, 28 percent of Republican
respondents to a Kos/Research
2000 poll said they thought
Obama wasn't born in the United
States, while 30 percent ""weren't
sure."" ""Obama should be in the
Big House,"" Taitz shrieked to me,
""not the White House!""
When Obama announced health
care reform as the first major
initiative of his administration,
the conservative movement
activated a campaign of
demonization -- transformational
politics -- designed to turn Obama
into the ""Other,"" making him
seem as unfamiliar, and therefore
as threatening, as possible. When
the president urged the Congress
to deliver a health care reform bill
in 2009, the Right staged a living
theater of political hatred,
Obama's dream of bipartisanship
transformed into a nightmarish
version of ""Marat/Sade."" On
September 12, 2009, tens of
thousands of far-right activists
belonging to a loose
confederation of anti-government
groups called the Tea Party
Patriots converged on
Washington's National Mall for a
giant protest against the Obama
health care plan. The date was
significant: Fox News's top-
ranked talk show host Glenn
Beck had declared the birth of the
""9-12 Project"" to restore the sense
of unity -- and siege mentality --
that Americans experienced on
September 11, 2001. But this
time, Obama -- not Osama -- was
the enemy.
While covering the rally, I
witnessed sign after sign
declaring Obama a greater danger
to America's security than al-
Qaida; demonstrators held images
that juxtaposed Obama's face
with images of evildoers from
Hitler to Pol Pot to Bin Laden;
others carried signs questioning
Obama's status as a U.S. citizen.
""We can fight al-Qaida, we can't
kill Obama,"" said an aging
demonstrator. Another told me,
""Obama is the biggest Nazi in the
world,"" pointing to placards he
had fashioned depicting Obama
and House Majority Leader
Nancy Pelosi in SS outfits.
According to another activist,
Obama's agenda was similar to
Hitler's: ""Hitler took over the
banking industry, did he not? And
Hitler had his own personal secret
service police. [The community-
organizing group] ACORN is an
extension of that.""
The seemingly incongruous Tea
Party propaganda recalled signs
waved by right-wing Jewish
settlers during rallies against
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin and his support of the
peace process, portraying him as
an SS officer and as the French
collaborator Marshall Petain. In
1995, amid the provocative
atmosphere, a young right-wing
Jewish zealot assassinated Rabin.
The Israeli tragedy was a
cautionary example of targeted
hatred leading to violence.
Members of the Tea Party
""Patriots"" did not seem to care
that their rhetoric was irrational,
or that comparing Obama to
Hitler and Stalin was
contradictory and obviously
hyperbolic. Their motives were
entirely negative. By purging
government of the multicultural
evil that had seized power
through illicit means (several
activists told me they believed
ACORN helped Obama steal the
election), they were convinced
that a mythical golden American
yesteryear would return. They
had no interest in building
anything new or even articulating
an agenda, much less discussing
the merits of policies. The Tea
Party's primary concern was
cultural purification -- freedom
from, not freedom to. Against the
dark image of the president and
his liberal allies, Tea Party
activists defined themselves as
the children of light. The racial
subtext was always transparent.
The Tea Party's strategy rested on
a guerrilla campaign of chaos and
sabotage designed not only to
intimidate Democrats but also to
disorient independent voters who
might have supported health care
reform. The Tea Partiers were
convinced this would be an easy
feat, since they believed the
majority of the country was on
their side -- that they represented
the ""Real America."" At the 9-12
rally Matt Kibbe, one of the
march organizers, told the crowd
that ABC News was reporting
that 1 million to 1.5 million
people were in attendance,
something ABC denied, saying
""ABCNews.com reported an
approximate figure of 60,000 to
70,000 protesters."" Then Armey
led the crowd in a chant of
""Freedom works! Freedom
works!"" Unknown to most of the
Tea Partiers, they were intoning
the name of a corporate-funded
Beltway advocacy group, not the
battle cry of Mel Gibson William
Wallace in Braveheart.
Contrary to its image as a
grassroots movement mobilized
to stifle the machinations of
Washington elites, the Tea Party
movement was the creation of a
constellation of industry-funded
conservative groups with close
Republican ties. The movement's
leading puppet-master was Dick
Armey, who directed resources
and talking points to the Tea
Party ""Patriots"" from his
Washington, D.C.-based
advocacy group, FreedomWorks.
Among the corporate clients of
Armey's lobbying firm, which he
was forced to leave as a result of
his involvement in the Tea
Parties, was the pharmaceutical
giant Bristol Myers Squibb, a
company with a clear interest in
defeating health care reform.
(Armey's other ""real American""
clients included the Marxist terror
cult, People's Mojahedin of Iran,
which received funding and
assistance from Saddam Hussein
in order to launch terrorist strikes
throughout the 1990's against
Iranian civilian targets.) Armey
collected a consulting fee of
$250,000 directly from
FreedomWorks and $300,000
from allied astroturf front groups.
FreedomWorks paid out much of
its money to an assortment of
Republican political consultants.
If Armey was the Tea Party king,
Sarah PalM was eager to be
crowned the Tea Party queen.
Just days after Obama's
inauguration, Palin abruptly quit
her job as Alaskan governor to
vie for the honor. PalM's motives
for quitting became clear when
she inked a lucrative deal to write
her political memoir Going
Rogue, signed on as a regular
contributor to Fox News, and
received $1 million an episode for
a reality show on cable television,
""Sarah Palin's Alaska."" PalM's
book tour, which sent her through
Middle America in a luxuriously
outfitted bus, resembled both a
presidential campaign and a
traveling carnival.
Whether or not PalM intends to
run for president, her growing
media presence has magnified her
influence within the Republican
Party. Yet the ever-expanding
Palin phenomenon was greeted
with hostility by Republican
politicos desperately seeking to
expand the party's base after the
drubbing in 2008. Former
McCain campaign manager Steve
Schmidt warned that Palin's
nomination in 2012 would be
""catastrophic"" for the GOP. His
doomsday prediction was backed
by an October Gallup poll
revealing her as one of the most
polarizing and unpopular political
figures in the country with a
disapproval rating of over 50
percent. Unfortunately for
Schmidt and other party
pragmatists, those who approve
of Palin represent the heartbeat of
the Republican Party, its most
fervent activists, and cannot be
dissuaded from following her,
even if she is leading the party off
a cliff.
A November 2009 special
congressional election in New
York's heavily Republican 23rd
district was the first major test of
Palin's power. Along with a
parade of nationally recognized
conservatives, Palin endorsed
Doug Hoffman, an unknown far-
right third-party candidate closely
allied with the Tea Party, helping
to force a popular moderate
Republican politician, Dede
Scozzafava, from the race. In the
end, Palin's ideological purge in
upstate New York led to an
improbable Democratic victory,
the first in that district in more
than 100 years. After the disaster
Palin and her allies claimed
victory, insisting they had at least
hastened the purge of
ideologically impure Republicans
from the party. She went on to
endorse Rand Paul, the son of
right-wing libertarian Rep. Ron
Paul and a candidate in
Kentucky's GOP senatorial
primary, while Dick Cheney went
out of his way to endorse Rand's
regular Republican opponent,
Trey Grayson, the Kentucky
secretary of state.
Following the Tea Party script of
avoiding social issues like
abortion and gay marriage in
order to obscure the large
presence of the Christian Right
within the movement's ranks, the
self-described ""hardcore pro-
lifer"" Palin recast herself as a
libertarian concerned primarily
with issues of ""economic
freedom."" She claimed the
Democratic ""cap and trade"" plan
to limit carbon emissions would
harm the livelihood of blue-collar
workers, and she assailed health
care reform as a Trojan Horse for
""socialism"" (though she admitted
her family ""used to hustle over
the border"" to take advantage of
Canada's single-payer health care
system). But no Palin attack had
as much effect as the one she
blasted out on her Facebook page
claiming the Obama health care
plan included a provision for
""death panels"" that would
recommend euthanasia for
severely ill patients like her
Down syndrome-afflicted son,
Trig. With the click of a button,
Palin transformed the tone of the
health care debate from rancorous
to poisonous.
The source of Palin's ""death
panels"" smear was a practiced
propagandist, former New York
Lieutenant Governor Betsy
McCaughey. When President Bill
Clinton introduced health care
reform during his first term,
McCaughey falsely claimed in an
article published in the New
Republic and widely circulated by
Republicans, that the plan would
force consumers to drop their
private plans and buy into the
government's program (the article
would go on to win a National
Magazine Award and then be
retracted years later by the New
Republic's editors). Now she was
back in the spotlight, pushing a
rumor that would be voted by the
non-partisan fact-checking Web
site Politifact.com as ""the lie of
2009."" McCaughey's latest
innuendo was boosted by the cult
of political crank Lyndon
LaRouche, which mobilized to
push the rumor into the
mainstream.
In June 2009, one of LaRouche's
top lieutenants publicly
confronted Ezekiel Emanuel, the
National Institute of Health's
chief bioethicist and brother of
White House chief of staff Rahm
Emanuel, accusing him of
seeking to reintroduce Hitler's T-
4 program to kill the handicapped
through health care reform.
""President Obama has put in
place a reform apparatus reviving
the euthanasia of Hitler Germany
in 1939, that began the genocide
there,"" LaRouche staffer Anton
Chaitkin charged. Soon,
LaRouche's followers were on
street corners around the country
with posters depicting Obama
with a Hitler moustache. At a
town hall forum on health care
reform hosted by Democratic
Rep. Barney Frank, a LaRouche
follower waved one of the
Obama-as-Hitler posters and
demanded, ""Why do you continue
to support a Nazi policy, as
Obama has expressly supported
this policy?""
Two months later, after Palin
whispered the rumor on
Facebook, prominent
conservatives from former
Speaker of the House Newt
Gingrich to ranking Senate
Finance Committee member
Charles Grassley parroted her
claims before audiences of
indignant Tea Partiers. Not to be
outdone, Glenn Beck devoted an
extended rant on his show to the
reality of death panels. Echoing
the LaRouche cultists, Beck
accused Ezekiel Emanuel of ""the
devaluing of human life, putting a
price on each individual."" He
thundered, ""The death panel is
not a firing squad. Rationing is
inevitable and they know it!""
The death panel rumor served a
variety of functions, all useful to
the movement, but not necessarily
to the Republican Party. Most
importantly, the rumor resonated
both with hard-core libertarians
who resented the very existence
of the federal government and
Christian Right activists who
viewed the legalization of
abortion as a slippery slope to
government-sponsored
euthanasia. The hysteria it
engendered helped repair the rift
exposed by the Terri Schiavo
charade in 2005, when the
evangelical conservative James
Dobson publicly clashed with
Armey, the libertarian leader,
over the right of the government
to interfere in a private family
matter of life and death.
The slurring of Obama as a sort
of sleeper agent crypto-Muslim
helped bring the neoconservatives
back into the fray. The new neo-
con generation was led by Dick
Cheney's daughter, Liz, who
founded an anti-Obama advocacy
group, Keep America Safe, by
leveraging donations from pro-
Israel sources. Asked by CNN's
Larry King about the Birther
movement that was challenging
Obama's status as an American
citizen, Liz Cheney remarked,
""One of the reasons you see
people so concerned about this is
people are uncomfortable with
having for the first time ever, I
think, a president who seems so
reluctant to defend the nation
overseas."" With the libertarians,
Christian Right, and the neo-cons
seated around the same table,
united in resentment of the alien
president, the conservative
movement was whole again.
The experiments in ""Terror
Management Theory"" of Sheldon
Solomon, professor of
psychology at Skidmore College,
Jeff Greenberg, professor of
psychologist at the Unviersity of
Arizona, and Tom Pyszczynski,
professor of psychology at the
University of Colorado, have
demonstrated the connection
between fear of death and
intensification of conservative
attitudes. The findings help
explain the effectiveness of the
death panel rumor and
insinuations by conservative
figures that Obama was not truly
American and somehow
sympathetic to Islamic terrorists.
Indeed, these seemingly irrational
smears were guided by tactical
reasoning, calculated to agitate
voters with constant reminders of
their own mortality. Whether or
not Independents responded, the
rhetoric of death kept the Tea
Party crowd in a persistent state
of panic and rage, ensuring a
standing army ready to fan out to
rallies and town halls at the first
sign of liberal malfeasance.
Obama's first year in office was
marked by more than raucous
protests; there were several
disturbing murders committed by
far-right extremists. In April
2009, a 22-year-old neo-Nazi
wannabe named Richard
Poplawsi mowed down a SWAT
team of Pittsburgh cops, killing
three. Poplawski's best friend told
reporters the young killer ""grew
angry recently over fears Obama
would outlaw guns."" Later it was
discovered that Poplawski had
posted a video clip to a neo-Nazi
Web site portraying Fox's Glenn
Beck contemplating the existence
of concentration camps. (After a
characteristically thorough
investigation, Beck conceded
they were not real.) On another
occasion, the killer posted a video
promoting Tea Party rallies. A
month after the Pittsburgh
bloodbath, Scott Roeder, a
supporter of the militant anti-
abortion group Operation Rescue,
shot Dr. George Tiller to death
while he prayed at his church in
Wichita, Kansas. Tiller was
declared fair game by the anti-
abortion movement because of
his role as Kansas's only late-term
abortion provider. During at least
28 episodes of Bill O'Reilly's
""O'Reilly Factor,"" O'Reilly had
referred to Tiller as ""Tiller the
baby killer,"" a criminal guilty of
""Nazi stuff."" ""I wouldn't want to
be [Tiller] if there is a Judgment
Day,"" O'Reilly proclaimed.
In August 2009, a middle-aged
professional named George
Sodini walked into a health club
in suburban Pittsburgh and
gunned down three women. The
mainstream press explained
Sodini's motives away by homing
in on passages in his online
diaries describing his loneliness,
inability to convince women to
have sex with him, and descent
into chronic masturbation. Nearly
every major media outlet omitted
or ignored a long deranged entry
in which Sodini projected his
sexual frustration onto Obama,
whom he seemed to view as a
symbol of black male virility and
predation.
The day after Obama's election
victory, Sodini wrote: ""Good luck
to Obama! He will be successful.
The liberal media LOVES him.
Amerika has chosen The Black
Man. Good! In light of this I got
ideas outside of Obama's plans
for the economy and such. Here it
is: Every black man should get a
young white girl ... Kinda a
reverse indentured servitude
thing. Every daddy know when
he sends his little girl to college,
she be ... real good. I saw it. 'Not
my little girl', daddy says! (Yeah
right!!) Black dudes have thier
[sic] choice of best white??
[ellipses in original].""
In another posting to an anti-
Clinton forum in 1994, during the
height of the Republicans'
Whitewater investigation, Sodini
revealed that he had purchased a
bumper sticker reading, ""Stop
Socialism, Impeach Clinton,""
from a National Review ad. A
year later, Sodini ranted on an
anti-government militia site, ""I
am convinced that more drastic
action is required to bring the
country back to the Constitutional
order that it was 200 years ago. I
don't think any group of political
leaders will achieve this for us.""
Whether or not Sodini's murder
spree was motivated by his
political passions, he was
pathologically death-driven and
fixated on the phantasmagoria of
right-wing imagery. In his final
diary entry, Sodini proclaimed,
""Death lives!""
More than any other media figure
of the Obama era, Glenn Beck
encouraged the campaign of
racial demonization and
conspiracy that consumed the Tea
Party ""Patriots."" During a
broadcast of ""Fox and Friends,""
Beck opined that Obama ""has
exposed himself over and over
and over again as a guy who has a
deep-seated hatred for white
people, or the white culture."" As
evidence, Beck pointed to White
House green-jobs czar Van Jones,
an African American former
community organizer who was
eventually forced to resign as a
direct result of Beck's crusade.
From there, Beck targeted another
black Obama adviser, Valerie
Jarrett, highlighting her ties to
ACORN while upholding her and
Jones as evidence of Obama's
""socialist"" agenda. In another
broadcast, Beck played an audio
clip of unidentified African
Americans referring to ""Obama
money"" as they collected welfare
checks in Detroit. Then he
showed footage of members of a
Kansas City-based youth group
practicing a step show, a
traditional African-American
group dance apparently
unfamiliar enough to Beck and
his transfixed audience that he
felt at liberty to claim the footage
as evidence that ""Obama's SS""
was being trained across inner-
city America.
In September 2009, Beck
relentlessly targeted ACORN, the
Right's new favorite hobgoblin,
admitting that he intended to use
the poor people's advocacy group
to distract his viewers from the
health care debate. ""Trust me,""
Beck said, ""Everybody now says
they're going to be talking about
health care. I don't think so."" (His
statement was reminiscent of
Rush Limbaugh's scandal-
mongering remark during the
early Clinton administration:
""Whitewater is about health
care."") Beck promptly cued up a
series of hidden camera videos
shot by conservative youth
activists James O'Keefe and
Hannah Giles inside ACORN
field offices. In the videos,
O'Keefe baited African-American
staffers into making statements
explaining that Giles, who
claimed she was a prostitute,
could obtain low-income housing.
O'Keefe edited in images of
himself clad in an outlandish
pimp costume to create the
impression that he was dressed
that way during the meetings with
ACORN; however, Giles later
admitted her partner had lied
about wearing his costume to
farther ineriminate ACORN. In
the end. ACORN was exonerated
of all criminal wrongdoing while
in a separate incident O'Keefe
was arrested and charged with a
federal crime after he and several
conservative pals disguised
themselves as telephone
repairmen and attempted to
wiretap phone lines in the office
of Senator Mary 'Landrieu of
Louisiana. Like Ryan Sorba,
O'Keefe and his posse were
movement cadres paid and
directed by well-funded
conservative outfits; O'Keefe had
been trained by the Leadership
Institute, the right-wing youth
Froup that nurtured leadinG, lights
like Jack Abriunoff, Karl Rove,
Ralph Reed, and Jeff Gannon.
While O'Keefe and his buddies
plea-bargained with prosecutors,
Beck basked in his formula for
success. His show earned the
hithest ratings at Fox News,
topping network franchises like
O'Reilly and Sean Hannity. In the
process. Beck's opinions became
firmly implanted in the nervous
systems of Tea Party activists.
""Glenn Beck has taught us
everything we know,"" a
demonstrator at the 9-12 rally told
Me. ""He's opened our eyes to so
much.""
But unlike the right-wing radio
warhorses who helped usher in
Newt Gin<trich's Republican
counter-revolution of 1994, Beck
was not an authentic product of
the movement. When Rush
Limbaugh first began dominating
the AM airwaves, Beck was
mired in the world of mid-level
commercial radio, delivering
corny yarns about lesbians and
celebrity trash in hopes of
becoming the next Howard Stem.
By night, as he has tirelessly
recounted, he medicated his
anxiety with cocaine and alcohol,
destroying his first marriage in
the process. ""We remember
Glenn from the womanizing, the
drinking, the drugs. Everybody
who knew him at the time saw
what a: complete mess he was,"" a
shock jock from Tampa, Florida,
who called himself Bubba the
Love Sponge remarked to me
during a broadcast of his
nationally syndicated show.
Like Dusty Rhodes, the pseudo-
populist demagogue of Elia
Kazan's 1957 film, A Face in the
Crowd. Beck was a self-
destructive drifter Who might
have been crumpled up with a
bottle of Mad Dog 20/20 in an
alleyway or been locked away in
,a prison cell had fame not found
him first. Beck was only able to
stabilize his life when he made
his escape from freedom.,
marrying a conservative Mormon,
converting to her religion, and
transmuting his urge to abuse
drugs into conservative radio
diatribes. When Beck first broke
into television On CNN's
Headline News Channel, he
struggled to articulate a coherent
political world view. If he
distinguished himself from other
big-time conservative .hosts in
any way, he did so through
strained and often snide attempts
at humor, remnants of his failed
radio career. Nevertheless, with
help from his liberal agent,
Matthew Hiltzik, Beck snagged a
primetime slot at Fox News in
early 2009. Around this same
time, Beck began promoting the
work of an arcane Mormon
conspiracy-peddler named W.
Clean Skousen, whom he
described as his political lodestar.
Suddenly, Beck had something
more to offer than irritable mental
gestures.
Thanks to Beck's designation of
Skousen's pseudohistorical tract
The 5000 Year Leap as ""required
reading"" on the Web site of his 9-
12 Project, and his promotion of
the book on his show, the
previously obscure Skousen.
became the Hidden imam of the
Tea Party movement. By the
summer of 2009, Skousen's Leap
was among the top 10 books on
Amazon.com and a fixture on
literature tables at Tea Party
gatherings. It went from selling a
puny couple of thousand copies in
2007 to selling over 200,000
copies in 2009. Just why the book
generated such an instant appeal
is difficult to understand. It is
little more than a slapdash of
quotes from the Founding
Fathers, often taken out of
context and deliberately
oversimplified, to explain why
America is the greatest nation in
history. in the process, Skousen
claims that church and state
separation is un-American, that
""coercive taxation"" is communist,
and that marriage is the
underpinning of a free society.
Benjamin Franklin., who wrote at
length on the merits of ""amours""
with ""old women,"" and who
famously solicited prostitutes and
fathered a son of out of wedlock,
was the ultimate authority
Skousen quoted on the
importance of marriage.
Though Skousen claims the
Founders as the world's foremost
source of eternal wisdom, he
buttressed his points with fringe
sources like the conspiracist
Norman Dodd's screeds about the
Illuminati. According. to Skousen,
Dodd claimed that ""powerful
influences congregating in the
United States"" like the
Rockefellers and the Rothschilds
had forced the United States into
World War I. Skousen published
Dodd's manifestoes in his obscure
journal Freemen's Digest, which
he founded for the express
purpose of propagating
conspiracies.
Skousen's paranoid politics were
an outgrowth of his participation.
in extreme anti-communist
groups during the 1950s. He
boasted of a close friendship with
then-FBI director J. Edgar
Hoover and said he provided him
with research on communist
plots, claims disputed by FBI
historians. (During a recent
interview. Skousen's son, Paul,
told me that contrary to rumors of
Hoover's cross-dressing and
homosexual dalliances, he would
set the top cop up on blind dates
with live women.) Skousen was
fired from his job as Salt Lake
City's police chief for, in the
words of the city's conservative
Mormon mayor, ""conduct[ing]
hi.s office as chief of police in
exactly the same manner in which
the communists operate their
government."" From there,
Skousen sailed off to the far
shores of the Right-peddling
conspiracy tracts like The Naked
Communist-, and earning
condemnation from his beloved
FBI, which accused him in an
internal memo of ""promoting
[his] own anti-communism for
obvious financial purposes.""
Skousen's vocal support for the
far-right John Birch Society's
claim that communists controlled
President Dwight Eisenhower
cost him the support of the
corporate backers who had paid
for his Red-bashing lecture tours.
He went off the radar for several
years, returning during the late
1960s to accuse the Jewish
Rothschild family of secretly
bankrolling everyone from Ho
Chi Minh to the civil rights.
movement. By the late 1970s,
even the Church of Latter Day
Saints distanced itself from
Skousen and his conspiracy
theories. His work fell through
the margins and might have
disappeared entirely had Beck not
revived it, turning The 5000 Year
Leap into the bible of the Tea
Party movement. Journalist
Alexander Zaitchik observed in
his authoritative profile of
Skousen on Salon.com that
Skousen's renewed influence
through Beck and the Tea Party
'suggests that the modern base of
the Republican Party is headed to
a very strange place.""
Besides influencing Beck,
Skousen's teachings inspired one
of the Tea Party movement's most
visible grassroots celebrities,
retired Sheriff Richard Mack. I
met Mack in February at a far-
right rally just outside of
Montgomery, Alabama. On a
makeshift stage towed into the
middle of a rodeo arena by a
pickup truck, Mack recalled with
reverence his mentorship by
Skousen, who he said taught him
everything he needed to know
about the Constitution. Mack
urged his spellbound audience to
stockpile ammo and store food.
""If you control the food supply,""
Mack warned, ""you control the
people. And that's the first step to
slavery.""
Already a hero to conservatives
for successfully suing the Clinton
administration over the provision
in the Brady Handgun Violence
Prevention Act requiring law
enforcement to conduct criminal
background checks of gun
purchasers, Mack reemerged in
the Obama era as the archetypal
local lawman who vowed to resist
the tyrannical federal
government. Along with a few
dozen former and active military
and law enforcement personnel,
Mack helped form a self-styled
Tea Party militia called the
Oathkeepers. Galvanized by their
fear of creeping socialism, the
Oathkeepers solemnly swore to
refuse tyrannical federal orders
such as cooperating with foreign
troops and forcing Americans
into concentration camps.
Because the group's members
trained for combat, the vow came
with suggestion of armed
resistance.
Besides Mack, the Oathkeepers
attracted a coterie of militia
movement retreads into its ranks.
The most well-established figure
was Mike Vanderboegh, a
longtime militia fanatic who
published a booklet in the mid-
1990s entitled Strategy and
Tactics for a Militia Civil War,
calling for sniper attacks on ""war
criminals, secret policemen, rats.""
With Obama in office,
Vandeboegh churned out anti-
government screeds on right-wing
blogs with renewed passion and
supported his efforts by cashing
in the $1,300 in federal disability
compensation he received each
month.
For all the energy the far right
exerted in its campaign to
strangle Obama's agenda, it was a
Democrat who posed the greatest
threat to the passage of health
care reform. Representative Bart
Stupak of Michigan had been in
office since 1993, placing him
among the senior leadership of
the so-called centrist Blue Dog
Democrats. When health care
reform was introduced in
Congress, Stupak became the
leader of an informal caucus of
anti-abortion Democrats, making
him the de facto swing vote on
the House version of the bill. By
extension, Stupak was the point
man in the campaign to ensure
that the bill would not allow
federal funding for abortion for
low-income women.
But after close consultation with
leaders of the U.S. Conference of
Catholic Bishops, Stupak went a
step further. He introduced a
draconian amendment to block
women from paying for abortions
from even their own private
insurance plans. The amendment,
which passed the House but was
shut down in the Senate, became
a key sticking point in health care
negotiations. 'He's a big hero
now in the pro-life community,""
former Bush Catholic issues
adviser Deal Hudson told me in
November 2009. ""Thanks to him,
this is the first time I can
remember the pro-life Democrats
having any power.""
To the chagrin of the
Republicans, Stupak entertained
offers of compromise from the
Democratic leadership.
According to Hudson, the
Catholic Bishops were keen to
see health care reform pass, but
only if the bill contained a clear
provision forbidding patients
from spending federal money on
abortion. Finally, in March, after
pressure from House Majority
Leader Nancy Pelosi, Obam.a
agreed to sign an executive order
forbidding the federal funding of
abortion. Stupak had been
mollified. Now he and his anti-
abortion caucus pledged to
deliver the swing votes the
Democrats needed to pass the
bill. As soon as reports seeped out
declaring the imminent passage
of health care reform, major
right-wing blogs like
RedState.org churned out virulent
denunciations of Stupak, calling
him a traitor and sellout. The blog
comment sections filled up with
dozens of diatribes referring to
Stupak in language previously
reserved for Dr. George Tiller:
""Bart the Baby-Killer.""
On March 20, thousands of Tea
Party activists surrounded the
Capitol's Longworth Building in
expectation of Obama's pep talk
to the House Democrats and the
health care vote. Democratic
Representative john Lewis, a
hero of the civil rights movement,
and Representative Barney Frank,
the first openly gay member of
Congress, passed through the
crowd on their way inside the
Capitol. Thsligger!"" a demonstrator
barked at Lewis. Another called
Frank a ""faggot,"" eliciting
laughter and cheers from nearby
protesters. Meanwhile, as another
African-American Democrat,
Representative Emanuel Cleaver,
ascended the Capitol steps, a
protester who had been screaming
at Lewis and Frank spat on his
face.
With the demonstration carried
on into the night, cries of ""Kill
the bill!'' drifted into calls for
violence. ""I would gladly stand
with any of you men here and
take these fascists down,"" a man
in camouflage battle dress
uniform proclaimed in front of an
amateur videographer, pointing
toward the Capitol. ""You haven't
heard the last of me!""
The next day, Republican
members of Congress emerged
from the Longworth Building to
salute the Tea Partiers. The
demonstrators cheered wildly for
their proxies on the inside.
Finally, after hours of
impassioned speeches on the
House floor, the bill passed. But
the drama was hardly over.
Republican Representative Joe
Pitts, an anti-abortion Catholic
who co-authored Stupak's
original amendment, demanded a
motion to bring it back to the
floor for a vote, a transparent
exercise in grandstanding that
was certain to fail. In response,
Stupak rushed to the podium with
a stinging rebuke to Pitts and the
Republicans. ""The motion to
commit does not support life,""
Stupak declared. ""It is the
Democrats who have stood up....""
Heckling from the Republican
side interrupted his statement. As
Stupak looked around the House
chamber, Rep. Randy
Neugebauer, a right-wing
Republican from Texas who
openly supported the Birther
movement, began shouting at him
from the backbench, ""Baby
killer!"" Other Republicans joined
in, parroting base insults.
While the Republicans sank their
heads in defeat, some more
militant devotees of the Tea Party
movement called for a right-wing
Kristallnacht. ""If you wish to
send a message that Pelosi and
her party cannot fail to hear,
break their windows,""
Vanderboegh of the Oathkeepers
wrote on a far-right blog hours
after the bill passed. ""Break them
NOW. Break them and run to
break again."" Within three days,
windows and doors at Democratic
Party headquarters in New York,
Kansas and Arizona had been
shattered.
Meanwhile, at least 10
Democratic members of Congress
reported receiving death threats.
Images of nooses were faxed to
the offices of Stupak and James
Clyburn, an African-American
congressman from South
Carolina. Representative Anthony
Weiner, an especially vocal
proponent of health care reform,
received a menacing letter filled
with white powder. The brother
of Representative Torn Perriello,
another health care supporter, had
his home gas line deliberately
sabotaged after a local Tea Party
organizer posted his address
online (he had meant to post the
congressman's) and encouraged
activists to ""drop by"" to express
their anger about Perriello's
recent vote. In Tucson, Arizona,
the windows of Democratic
Representative Gabrielle
Giffbrds' office were shattered by
shots from a pellet gun. And a
brick was thrown through the
window of Representative Louise
Slaughter's office in New York as
her voicemail filled with threats
of impending sniper attacks.
After the Passage of the health
care bill, the Tea Party floated
into a gray zone between
authoritarianism and anarchy.
Crusading to restore a holy social
order, they promoted disorder.
Claiming to protect democracy,
they smashed windows of elected
representatives. Warning of death
panels, they called in death
threats. With the atmosphere of
violence thickening, Palin took to
her Twitter account to issue a
battle cry: ""Don't Retreat,
Instead—RELOAD!"" Thus
concluded the first phase of the
Obama era that was to usher in a
peaceable kingdom of
bipartisanship.

5842,"Middle EastCongratulations on the resumption of direct talks. As evidenced by your activity over the
past several weeks your involvement in the peace process inevitably has deepened as the
need for high-level U.S. intervention has grown. I believe that is a positive result. But
the more fundamental issue remains what your role can and should be going forward in
order to maximize chances of diplomatic success.
I. . State of Play
As the U.S. embarks on the next stage in the Israeli-Palestinian process, it faces a series
of tactical and strategic challenges regarding policy, politics and personality.
1. At a policy level, the meager results of indirect talks and difficulties in transitioning to
direct talks have underscored the lack of trust between the two sides as well as
existing substantive gaps. With direct talks begin in the coming days, one obstacles
will have been removed, but several remain. Some or all of these may have been
resolved in connection with gaining agreement to direct talks.
a. How to handle the renewal or non-renewal of Israel's settlement moratorium?
b. What is the goal of the direct talks and is there a consensus on this matter
between the parties? A comprehensive agreement on permanent (CAPS) that
covers all the details? A framework agreement on permanent status (FAPS)
that outlines the governing parameters, along the lines of the 2000 Clinton
parameters? Or, less ambitiously, a short (one or two page) statement of
principles?
c. What role will the U.S. play? Will George or another U.S. official be present
in all meetings? Will Netanyahu accept that? Is there an argument for
allowing the two sides to deal with one another without any intermediary, at
least for a while, so that they do not seek to play to the U.S.?
d. What will the U.S. do in the event of an impasse or breakdown? Should it
present bridging proposals and, if so, when?
e. How much work should be done, in parallel and simultaneously with the
direct talks, between the U.S. and the Palestinians on the one hand and the
U.S. and Israel on the other?
Beyond those questions, I am persuaded the most important factor is and is likely to
remain what Netanyahu is prepared to do. You have witnessed first-hand how
difficult it can be to deal with the Palestinians and the Arab world more generally;
how fragile is Abbas's political position; how indecisive they can be. Still, at bottom,
we have a relatively clear sense of their positions on the core issues should we ever
reach a moment of truth. That is not the case with Netanyahu who either does not
know himself or is not prepared to share and who, until now, has neither felt the
urgency to reach a deal nor the discomfort of the status quo.
Assuming Bibi can be convinced of the benefits of a deal along lines acceptable to the
Palestinians, this will not occur solely on the basis of his talks with Abbas, whom he
likes but does not truly respect and who he fears will not be in a position to deliver.
Rather, it will happen only if he feels that (1) it is under the leadership of a U.S.
administration he genuinely trusts; (2) he is convinced that the combination of the
agreement and U.S. assurances meets his core needs in terms of Israeli security and
international recognition of its Jewish character; and (3) he feels that, again with U.S.
help, he can sell it to his people and survive -- or even thrive -- politically.
Getting Bibi to accept the core compromises will not be enough, of course. Other
basic elements of the strategy must involve reaching out effectively to the Israeli
public and ensuring strong, vocal Arab support for a U.S.- sponsored deal without
which Abbas cannot say yes and Israelis will lack the incentive to do so. But the
point is that a prerequisite for a successful peace effort is for the U.S. to convince the
prime minister -- through various forms of overt persuasion and implicit pressure -- to
make the necessary compromises. At the end of the day, if Bibi is to make a deal, it
will be a deal with the U.S. as much as with the Palestinians.
2. At a political level, the past year has clearly demonstrated the degree to which the
U.S. has been hamstrung by its low ratings in Israel and among important segments of
the domestic Jewish constituency. This is a critical dimension not for electoral
reasons, but because the U.S.'s best chance of influencing Bibi is to build support for
a deal in Israel and at home among those who care most. That capacity has been
improved to some extent as a result of the successful July visit by Netanyahu and the
string of military/security deals between our two countries. But we must be honest:
there sill is a long way to go. If anything, the recent Obama/Bibi illustrated a new,
potentially perverse dynamic: the U.S. president at this juncture needs the Israeli
prime minister to validate his pro-Israeli credentials more than the Israeli prime
minister needs the U.S. president to vouch for his pro-peace ones.
3. At the level of personalities, George, with all his skill and perseverance, cannot by
himself secure serious concessions from the parties by himself. In recent discussions,
both Israelis and Palestinians described him as someone they respected but to whom
they would not make major concessions. This is the curse of the day-to-day
negotiator. When they are ready to deal, they will only deal with the players they
perceive with authority. It was not different for Dennis during the Clinton
Administration. This does not mean that Mitchell does not have a crucial role going
forward. Indeed, he can be empowered by your more active involvement.
The president faces a different but no less difficult problem. He is not trusted in
Israel and, though the July meeting might have altered the situation somewhat, not
trusted by Bibi. Domestically, he faces a reservoir of skepticism on this issue which
reflects many factors, including inexcusable prejudice, but which could obstruct his
effectiveness both as an interlocutor and as a salesman. Besides, as we learned during
WJC's presidency, it would be a mistake for Obama to get too deeply invested in
negotiations prior to the end-point; he does not have the time and should not expend
the political capital prematurely. To do so, moreover, would automatically be to
devalue the role of anyone beneath him, thus making the peace process as a whole
excessively dependent on his involvement.
Your Role
Under these circumstances, in my view, your deeper involvement is both essential and
potentially highly beneficial. It should be a selective involvement; Mitchell still must be
the day-to-day negotiator and others also must play a part. In particular, I would not
recommend you get overly mired in the details of the direct talks or the set of questions I
described above (about their format, goal, U.S. role, etc) other than at critical junctures.
Nor would I advise you to get pulled into a Christopher-style shuttle diplomacy which
would quickly depreciate your value.
Rather, by injecting yourself strategically at the right time and in the right way, you could
fill the gaps identified above. This is because you are uniquely placed to address the
need both for a higher-level mediator and for someone who enjoys considerable
credibility in Israel and the U.S. (Bibi reportedly told someone recently he was prepared
to deal substantively with Obama and with you).
Your role would be twofold
1. To serve as the higher-level interlocutor on matters offinal status. To a large
degree, Abbas's positions are already known; they will have to be further explored
and he will have to be pushed, and you should engage him. But we probably know
his zone of possible agreement. Not so with Bibi and, I believe, you are ideally suited
to begin a series of in-depth conversations aimed at understanding his key concerns,
how they can be met, what he would need from us and others, and how far, at the end
of the day, he is prepared to go with the Palestinians if his security and other needs
are met. Bibi knows and trusts you; in fact, you are almost certainly the high-level
U.S. official he trusts most. If you succeed in taking him into your confidence and
work with him over time, you could pave the way for an Israeli-U.S. understanding
that would underpin an Israeli-Palestinian agreement. At times, this will require
being tough and pushing back against some of his most extreme demands (the
militarily questionable request for a very long term Israeli presence in the Jordan
Valley being one of them) and proposing more rational alternatives. But the point is
that without getting Bibi to trust and level with us, without him feeling both what he
has to lose but also what he has to gain, this process is unlikely to go anywhere.
To repeat, this should not be at Mitchell's expense. It should be a parallel,
reinforcing process in which you would deal one-on-one with Abbas and Netanyahu
at periodic intervals, for extensive periods of time.
2. To help restore the US. 's image and credibility in Israel and among important
domestic constituencies. You have the history, background and credentials to do so
here and in Israel and thus to overcome some of the suspicion with which Obama
must contend. Over time, through a series of visits and public statements, you would
seek to make the case for a peace agreement in positive terms, focusing on what
benefits it would bring to Israelis rather than on the costs they would incur: secure
and recognized borders; stronger security ties to the U.S. and others; an end to the
conflict; normal relations with the Arab world; and strengthened international
legitimacy.
III. Potential Downsides and Responses
1. Dragging you into the weeds of negotiations. A risk exists that, though repeated
meetings with Bibi and Abbas, you will be drawn into detailed discussions over the
nature of the territorial compromise, the precise security arrangements, etc. This
would be unhelpful both to the process and to you. There is a fine line between
discussing the principles that should guide the final outcome and the precise details of
that outcome, but it will be important not to cross it. Your role should be to extract
from Bibi important understandings and parameters (e.g., security arrangements on
the Jordan valley that minimize infringements on Palestinian sovereignty and
minimize the duration of any residual Israeli presence) and then have your respective
negotiators work out the details
2. Disempowering George. A related danger is to render George powerless by creating
the sense that everything can and should be dealt with through you. Besides
potentially leading him to step down, this outcome would not serve your interests for
the reasons just cited, your effectiveness being a function of your remaining
somewhat removed from the day-to-day specifics of the talks. In fact, as I see it, this
process could and should end up strengthening George's presently hand by clarifying
it. Once you and Bibi will have reached agreement on broad principles, the two of
you will provide instructions to your respective negotiators to find solutions that
reflect them. In that sense, both George and his counterpart will have a stronger and
clearer mandate than currently is the case.
3. Involving you in a failed enterprise. Of all the potential downsides, this is the most
significant one and ought not to be dismissed lightly. Failure is a real possibility.
Palestinians are in disarray. The Arab world is profoundly divided, with forthcoming
successions in Egypt and Saudi Arabia that will weaken two of the states upon which
we most rely. And a serious questionmark hovers over Bibi's politics, his head and
his heart. As a result, a powerful argument could be made that you would be better
off keeping at arms' length from this process, especially given how much else is on
your plate. That said, I disagree for the following reasons:
a. By not getting involved, you risk the worst of two worlds: being associated
with a failure (which, by virtue of your position, you inevitably would be) and
being criticized for not having been engaged in an effort to avert it.
b. Over the past year and a half, you have been involved -- traveling to the
region; seeking to convince Abbas to enter into talks; commenting on the
settlement freeze in Jerusalem -- and you will not be able to escape that kind
of involvement in the future. The problem is that your engagement has
appeared to be sporadic rather than strategic -- that you've been deployed
when it has been deemed necessary to get out of an impasse rather than in
order to implement a long term, well thought-out plan. I do not think that has
served you well.
c. While one cannot by any means be confident of success, I believe an
agreement is possible but that it only has a chance if we can work effectively
to bring Bibi into a position where he believes that the costs of a historical
compromise are outweighed by its benefits.
d. If we don't try all we can over the next year or year and a half, you will in all
likelihood be forced to deal extensively with the Middle East -- albeit not in a
peacemaking but in a crisis-managing mode. Without movement on the
peace process, Abbas could depart, Fayyad's state-building plan could be gone
in smoke, hostilities might break out between Israel, Syria and Hizbollah and
the U.S. would have to deal with Iran in an even less hospitable regional

""minister in a skirt""
http://mobile.nytimes.com/a rticle?a=644869
North Korea Takes to Twitter and YouTube By CHOE SANG-HUN The New York Times August 17, 2010
SEOUL, South Korea - North Korea has taken its propaganda war against South Korea and the United States to a new
frontier: YouTube and Twitter.
In the last month, North Korea has posted a series of video clips on YouTube brimming with satire and vitriol against
leaders in South Korea and the United States.
In one clip, it called Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton a ""minister in a skirt"" and Secretary of Defense Robert M.
Gates a ""war maniac,"" while depicting the South Korean defense minister, Kim Tae-young, as a ""servile dog"" that likes to
be patted by ""its American master.""
Such language used to be standard in North Korea's cold-war-era propaganda. Its revival is testimony to the increased
chill in relations between the Koreas in recent months.
In the past week, North Korea also began operating a Twitter account under the name uriminzok, or ""our nation.""
Both the Twitter and YouTube accounts are owned by a user named ""uriminzokkiri."" The Web site
www.uriminzokkiri.com is run by the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea, a propaganda agency in
Pyongyang.
Lee Jong-joo, a spokeswoman for the Unification Ministry in Seoul, said, ""It is clear that these accounts carry the same
propaganda as the North's official news media, but we have not been able to find out who operates them.""
The two Koreas agreed to stop their psychological war after their first summit meeting in 2000. But South Korea
resumed propaganda radio broadcasts in May, when it accused the North of torpedoing one of its warships, killing 46
sailors.
North Korea, which denies involvement, has vowed to retaliate. It appears to have found a way with Twitter and
YouTube, with their intended audience clearly South Koreans. (North Korea keeps its people isolated from the outside
world.)
""YouTube and Twitter gave North Korea a high-tech detour for its propaganda,"" said Paik Hak-soon, an analyst at Sjong
Institute. ""But fundamentally, it's not new technology but rather political tension that drives the North to lash out
desperately in the face of mounting international pressure.""
During the cold war era, South Korea punished people caught listening to North Korean broadcasts. Several years ago,
during the brief era of its ""sunshine policy"" of engaging the North, the South allowed its people access to North Korean
Web sites. But today, when a computer user in South Korea clicks on an item on the North Korean Twitter account, a
government warning against ""illegal content"" pops up.
These blocks have triggered criticism here that the Seoul government does not trust its people to form their own
opinions about the totalitarian North.
But the government says the North is using the Internet to spread conspiracy theories about who was behind the sinking
of the South Korean warship, including one claim that an American submarine did so to foster a militant mood in the
South.
The Twitter account, which provides links to the North Korean Web site, had 928 followers as of Monday. But a few
YouTube video clips uploaded by the North commanded thousands of views.
In one such clip, North Korea attacked Yu Myung-hwan, the South Korean foreign minister, who recently criticized ""pro-
North Korean youths"" who voted for the opposition in the June local elections, saying, ""If they like the North so much,
they should go and live under Kim Jong-il.""
The clip's narrator calls Mr. Yu a ""pro-American flunky"" and advised Mr. Yu to earn a living ""mopping the floor of the
Pentagon.""
Another clip claimed that North Korea would prevail in a war with the ""American imperialists"" because it was armed
with nuclear-fusion technology; because of its juche, or ideology of ""self-reliance""; and because of a philosophical
treatise written by Kim II-sung, the North's founding president and the father of Kim Jong-il, who died in 1994.
""I don't think this propaganda from the North will have any significant impact among South Koreans,"" said Yoo Ho-yeol,
an expert on North Korea at Korea University here. ""People watch this for fun, not to be influenced.""","['North', 'Korea', 'SEOUL', 'South', 'Korea', 'North', 'Korea', 'South', 'Korea', 'United', 'States', 'North', 'Korea', 'South', 'Korea', 'United', 'States', 'North', 'Korea', 'Koreas', 'North', 'Korea', 'Pyongyang', 'Seoul', 'Koreas', 'South', 'Korea', 'North', 'Korea', 'North', 'Korea', 'North', 'Korea', 'South', 'Korea', 'North', 'South', 'South', 'Korea', 'Seoul', 'North', 'South', 'North', 'Korea', 'North', 'Korea', 'North', 'Korea']"

Does Thomas Friedman Have to Talk to ""Senior Economic Policy Makers"" to Get So
Many Things Wrong?
Dean Baker is co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington, DC.
Wednesday, 18 August 2010 04:04
Thomas Friedman begins his oiece 1Q(44v by telling readers that: ""over the past few weeks I've had a chance to
speak with senior economic policy makers in America and Germany."" This might lead readers to believe that
he is about to share some great insights that would only be possible for someone with special access to these
senior economic policy makers.
Readers with this expectation will be seriously disappointed. There is nothing here that is more insightful than
what can be found on the Washington Post's editorial pages on an average workday. Friedman rehashes the
usual cliches, with the usual lack of thought. In doing so, he gets both the story of the recent past and the
present seriously wrong.
Starting with the past, he badly misrepresents the prior business cycle:
""we've just ended more than a decade of debt-fueled growth during which we borrowed money from China to
give ourselves a tax cut and more entitlements but did nothing to curtail spending or make long-term
investments in new growth engines.""
The main problem facing the U.S. economy of the last decade was a lack of demand. This was in large part due
to the fact that China lent to us. China's lending was its policy of propping up the value of the dollar in order to
maintain its export market in the United States. (At the start of the decade, the Clinton administration had also
tried to promote an over-valued dollar.) The over-valued -U.S. dollar made imports from China and other
countries very cheap in the United States and made our exports expensive in other countries. This led to a large
and growing trade deficit over most of the business cycle. The trade deficit replaced domestic demand,
preventing the economy from approaching normal levels of employment (even with the boost from the housing
bubble) until just before the crash.
There is no reason whatsoever to believe that China's decision to prop up the dollar was in any way affected by
the Bush tax cuts. In other words, neither the Bush tax cuts nor the growth in entitlements had anything to do
with our borrowing from China. The issue was China's decision to lend and thereby prop up the dollar. Given
the weakness of demand through most of the decade, these expenses could have been easily filled by domestic
production without borrowing from abroad.
Friedman does no better when he shifts the discussion from the past to the present. He refers to businesses'
reluctance to hire as the result of ""unusual uncertainty,"" a phrase attributed to Federal Reserve Board Chairman
Ben Bemanke. Of course there is no reluctance to hire, there is simply a lack of demand for labor. A reluctance
to hire would be reflected in an increasing number of hours per worker, as employers sought to meet their
demand for labor by working the existing workforce more hours.
This is not happening. There is a modest uptick in hours from the low point of the downturn, but the increase
in hours per worker is certainly no more rapid than in other recessions and the average workweek is still far
shorter in just about every sector than it was before the downturn.
Later he tells readers:
""America's solvency inflection point is coinciding with a technological one. Thanks to Internet diffusion, the
rise of cloud computing, social networking and the shift from laptops and desktops to hand-held iPads and
iF'hones, technology is destroying older, less skilled jobs that paid a decent wage at a faster pace than ever
while spinning off more new skilled jobs that pay a decent wage but require more education than ever.""
This is a great story -- social networking is soaring, IPads are everywhere -- does Friedman have any evidence
whatsoever that this development has increased the demand for educated workers and reduced the demand for
less educated workers? If so, this would be the place in his column to present the evidence. Otherwise, readers
might think that the 4.7 percent unemployment rate for college grads (nearly triple the pre-recession level),
coupled with a decline in their real wages over the decade, implies a reduced demand for the labor of highly
educated workers as well as less educated workers.
Friedman's proposed fix also seems a bit wide of the mark. He insists:
""There is only one way to deal with this challenge: more innovation to stimulate new industries and jobs that
can pay workers $40 an hour, coupled with a huge initiative to train more Americans to win these jobs over
their global competitors. There is no other way.""
We better hope there is another way. A wage of $40 an hour would put a worker well over the 90th percentile
on the wage distribution. Even if we double the number of jobs in this pay range -- an incredible
accomplishment -- what happens to the other 80 percent of the workforce?
Friedman then warns us of the challenge from Europe by getting Germany's past and present wrong:
""Keeping up with Germany won't be easy. A decade ago Germany was the 'sick man of Europe.' No more. The
Germans pulled together. Labor gave up wage hikes and allowed businesses to improve competitiveness and
worker flexibility, while the government subsidized firms to keep skilled workers on the job in the downturn.""
Germany clearly has done sorne changes that benefited its economy, like work sharing, and some that haven't,
but its past as the ""sick man of Europe"" is an invention of Friedman or his highly placed sources. Germany
always ran a trade surplus. That is the most basic measure of a country's competitiveness: foreigners are buying
its goods. Germany's unemployment rate in 2.000 ayeravd 7
.,5_percept, not hugely different than its current 7.0
percent rate.
The story here is that Friedman seems to have completely missed the basics of the current economic crisis in
spite of his weeks of conversing with senior economic policy makers. The current crisis is due to a lack of
demand pure and simple. If we generate demand either through more expansionary Fed monetary policy,
greater fiscal stimulus, or increased exports due to a falling dollar, there is no reason to believe that the
economy will not return to high levels of employment. Certainly Friedman has presented no evidence that
increased demand will not generate increased employment as it always has.
The longer term debt problem is overwhelmingly a health care story. Apparently Mr. Friedman's sources don't
have access to documents like the Medicare trustees report, which imply that U.S. health care costs will be
controlled and there will be no serious long-term deficit problem. This may prove -Wrong, but it seems that it
would have at least been worth noting in his column. Of course, if we have not fixed our health care system,
we can always achieve huge saving by retyinq on the more efficient health care systems in other countries.
If Friedman's intention was to scare us, he succeeded. After all, if senior economic policy makers in the U.S.
and Germany are as badly misinformed as Friedman implies, then we can expect some very had times ahead.","['China', 'Washington', ',', 'DC', 'America', 'Germany', 'China', 'U.S.', 'China', 'China', 'United', 'States', 'China', 'United', 'States', 'China', 'China', 'China', 'America', 'Europe', 'Germany', 'Germany', 'Germany', 'Europe', 'Germany', 'Europe', 'Germany', 'Germany', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'Germany']"

It May have been a nightmarish year for Pakistan but it has been a pretty good one for the country's inscrutable chief of
army staff, the most powerful man in the Land of the Pure, General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani.
For a start, the army's response to the floods has compared well to the usual corrupt incompetence of Pakistan's civilian
politicians, guided by their chateau-hopping president, Asif Ali Zardari (while minister for investment, he was nicknamed
""Mr 10 Per Cent""; he has now been upgraded to ""Mr 110 Per Cent""). This has led to discussion in army circles about
whether it is time to drop the civilian fig leaf and return the country to the loving embrace of its military. So serious is this
threat, that one of the country's most senior and well-connected journalists. Najam Sethi, editor-in-chief of the Friday
Times, went on the record this month to warn that elements in the army were plotting yet another coup.""( know this is
definitely being discussed,"" he said.
Then there was the news that Kayani was going to be allowed to keep his job for a second term: ""an extraordinary
situation requires an extraordinary decision to overcome it"", explained a brigadier, writing in the Nation newspaper.
Kayani, a former head of Pakistan's notorious intelligence agency, the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISO, can now continue
to run the army, and by default Pakistan's foreign policy, until November 2013.
But Kayani's biggest triumph this year, arguably the greatest of his career, was his visit to Kabul in July as the honoured
guest of the Afghan president, Hamid Karzai. The visit marked an important thawing in Pak-Afghan relations, which
have been glacial ever since Karzai came to power in 2001. It also coincided with the sacking of Amrullah Saleh,
Karzai's pro-Indian and rabidly anti-ISI former security chief. Saleh is a tough Tajik who rose to prominence as a
mujahedin protege of Ahmed Shah Massoud, the Indian-backed ""Lion of Panjshir"". The Taliban, and their sponsors in
the ISI, had regarded Saleh as their fiercest opponent, something Saleh was enormously proud of.
When I had dinner with him in Kabul in May, he spoke at length of his frustration with the ineffectiveness of Karzai's
government in taking the fight to the Taliban, and the extent to which the ISI was managing to aid, arm and train its
puppet insurgents in North Waziristan and Balochistan. Saleh's sacking gave notice of an important change of direction
by Karzai. As Bruce Riedel, Barack Obama's Af-Pak adviser, said when the news broke, ""it means that Karzai is already
planning for a post-American Afghanistan"". •
It seems that Kayani and Karzai are discussing some sort of accommodation between the Afghan government and ISI-
sponsored elements in the Taliban, maybe those of Sirajuddin Haqqani, which could give over much of the Pashtun
south to pro-Pakistan Taliban, but preserve Karzai in power in Kabul after the US withdrawal. The expulsion of India,
Pakistan's great regional rival, from Afghanistan, or at least the closing of its four regional consulates, would be a top
priority for the ISI in return for any deal that kept Karzai in power.
With the US toppling of the Taliban after the 11 September 2001 attacks, Pakistan's influence disappeared abruptly from
Afghanistan and
India quickly filled the vacuum. To the ISI's horror, in the early years of this decade, India provided reconstruction
assistance and training worth roughly £835m in total. It also built roads, sanitation projects, the new Afghan parliament
and free medical facilities across the country. It even offered to help train the Afghan army. Nato refused. As General
Stanley McChrystal put it in a report last year, ""while Indian activities largely benefit the Afghan people, increasing Indian
influence in Afghanistan is likely to exacerbate regional tensions and encourage Pakistani countermeasures"".
McChrystal was right. The Pakistanis have always been paranoid about the small Indian presence in Afghanistan. ""We
have strong evidence [that India is] using Afghanistan against Pakistan's interests to destabilise Pakistan,"" a foreign
ministry spokesman claimed in March. Pakistan's military establishment, terrified of the economic superpower emerging
to the south, believes it would be suicide to accept an Indian presence in what it regards as its Afghan backyard - a
potential point of retreat for the army in the event of an Indian invasion, something Pakistani analysts refer to as vital
""strategic depth"".
According to Indian diplomatic sources, there are still fewer than 3,600 Indians in Afghanistan; there are only ten Indian
diplomatic officers, as opposed to nearly 150 in the UK embassy. Yet the horror of being encircled has led the ISI to risk
Pakistan's relationship with its main strategic ally, the US, in order to keep the Taliban in play and its leadership under
ISI patronage in Quetta - a policy Kayani developed while head of the IS!. Karzai's new deal with the Pakistanis, and his
clear intention to try to reach some accommodation with their proxies among the Taliban, therefore represents a major
strategic victory for Kayani and Pakistan's military, as well as a grave diplomatic defeat for India.
Pakistan's support for the Taliban today is only the most recent chapter of an old story of complicity between jihadi
movements and the Pakistani state. Since the days of the anti-Soviet mujahedin, Pakistan's army saw violent Islamic
groups as an ingenious and cost-effective means of both dominating Afghanistan (which they finally achieved with the
retreat of the Soviets in 1987) and bogging down the Hindu-dominated Indian army in Kashmir (which they managed
with great effect from 1990 onwards).
The former ISI director and Dick Dastardly lookalike Hamid Gul, who was largely responsible for developing the strategy,
once said to me: ""If the jihadis go out and contain India, tying down one rnillion men of their army on their own soil, for a
legitimate cause, why should we not support them?"" Next to Gul in his Islamabad living room lay a piece of the Berlin
Wall presented to him by the city's people for ""delivering the first blow"" to the Soviet empire through his use of jihadis in
the 1980s. The WikiLeaks documents suggest he is still busy liaising with jihadis in his ""retirement"".
The Pakistani military top brass were long convinced that they could control the militants they have nurtured. In a taped
conversation between President Pervez Musharraf and Muhammad Aziz Khan, his chief of general staff, that India
released in 1999, Aziz said the army had the jihadis by their ""tooti"" (balls). Yet the Islamists have increasingly followed
their own agendas, sending suicide bombers out against not just Pakistan's religious minorities and political leaders, but
even the IS! headquarters. Nonetheless, many in the army still believe the jihadis are a more practical defence against
Indian hegemony than nuclear weapons. For them, supporting Islamist groups is not an ideological or religious whim, so
much as a practical and patriotic imperative - a vital survival strategy for a Pakistani state.
The army and ISI continued this duplicitous and risky policy after 11 September 2001 despite Musharrafs public
promises to the contrary. The speed with which the US lost interest in Afghanistan after its invasion and embarked on
plans to invade Iraq convinced the Pakistani army that the Washington had no long-term commitment to Karzai's
regime. This led to the generals keeping the Taliban in reserve, to be used to reinstal a pro-Pakistani regime in Kabul
once the American gaze had turned elsewhere.
So it was that the .ISI gave refuge to the leadership of the Taliban after it fled from Afghanistan in 2001. Mullah
Mohammed Omar was kept in an IS! safehouse in Quetta; his militia was lodged in the sprawling suburb of
Pashtunabad. There, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar presided over the Taliban military committee and war chest.
Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, the leader of Hizb-e-lslami, was lured back from exile in Iran and allowed to operate freely
outside Peshawar, while Jalaluddin Haqqani, one of the most violent Taliban commanders, was given sanctuary in North
Waziristan. Other groups were despatched to safehouses in Balochistan.
By 2004, the US had filmed Pakistani army trucks delivering Taliban fighters at the Afghan border and recovering them
a few days later; wireless monitoring at the US base at Bagram picked up Taliban commanders arranging with Pakistani
army officers at the border for safe passage as they came in and out of Afghanistan. Western intelligence agencies
concluded that the ISI was running a full training programme for the Afghan Taliban, turning a blind eye as they raised
funds in the Gulf and allowing them to import materiel, mainly via Dubai. By 2005 the Taliban, with covert Pakistani
support, were launching a full-scale assault on Nato troops in Afghanistan and being given covering fire as they returned
to their bases in Pakistan.
At the same time, Taliban attacks on Indian interests in Afghanistan intensified, beginning the process of turning the
Afghan conflict, like that in Kashmir, into what it is today: an lndo-Pak proxy war. The Indian embassy in Kabul was twice
bombed - in July 2008 and October 2009 - as were two city-centre hotels thought to have been used by the Research
and Analysis Wing (Raw), the Indian intelligence agency. Seven Indian civilians and two Indian military officers died in
the blasts.
The degree to which the ISI has been controlling the Afghan Taliban has only just become clear, and not just in the
documents published by WikiLeaks. A report by Matt Waldman of the Carr Centre for Human Rights at Harvard, based
on interviews with ten former senior Taliban commanders, closely documents how the IS! ""orchestrates, sustains and
strongly influences"" the Taliban and shows how the !SI is even represented on the Taliban's supreme leadership
council, the Quetta Shura.
Meanwhile, in the Punjab, Hafiz Mohammad Saeed, founder of Lashkar-e-Toiba, and the man believed to have been
behind the 2008 Bombay attacks, has been allowed to continue operating from Muridke, near Lahore. ""The powerful
western world is terrorising Muslims,"" he told a conference in Islamabad this year. ""We are being invaded, manipulated
and looted. We must fight the evil trio of America, Israel and India. Suicide missions are in accordance with Islam. In
fact, a suicide attack is the best form of jihad.""
At the same time as Pursuing its policy of selectively using jihadis, Pakistan has appeased the US by giving generous
assistance to the CIA in arresting foreign Arab al-Qaeda personnel. A major assault was also launched against both the
militants who took over the Lal Masjid and the ultra-radical Pakistan Taliban who took over the Swat Valley and
announced their intention of turning the country into an Islamic Emirate. In the course of these operations and others in
the Federally Administered Tribal Areas, more than 1,500 Pakistani soldiers and policemen were killed; another 250,000
people were made homeless in the Pak army assault on Bajaur. The IS1 has even been prepared to arrest any members
of the Afghan Taliban who didn't follow orders. Hence the seizure in Karachi, in February, of the Taliban second-in-
command, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, along with aboutia dozen other senior Taliban whom the ISI regarded as
infringing on their hospitality by opening talks with the Karzai administration via the Saudis, without ISI clearance.
Yet, even though the Pakistani army has conducted major offensives in six of the tribal areas, the seventh, North
Waziristan, has been left alone, as it is home to the ISI's favourite proxies: Haqqani and Hekmatyar. Similarly, Pakistan's
foot-dragging response to the 2008 attacks on Bombay, and the lack of response to the attacks on minority faith groups
in Pakistan over the past few months, show that the Janus-faced policy remains in place. This summer, the chief
minister of the Punjab, Shahbaz Sharif, was quoted heatedly denying that there were any militant groups working in the
Pakistani Punjab, or that the Punjabi Taliban even existed. There are still, in the eyes of many in the Pakistani
establishment, good Taliban and bad Taliban, useful militants and expendable ones.
In their eyes, the ongoing defeat of Nato in Afghanistan, with US and British troops suffering record casualties last
month, is a vindication of its long-term strategy. Islamabad has succeeded in regaining influence in Afghanistan and
Delhi has been checked. But India will not take this lying down. Already the Indian press has reported attempts to -
resuscitate the Northern Alliance as a contingency against the Taliban's takeover of the south, and here India is working
in conjuction with Russia, Iran and the central Asian ""stans"". The Indian national security adviser, Shivshankar Menon,
was despatched to Afghanistan in March, and the foreign minister, S M Krishna, has visited Tehran. Post-American
Afghanistan is looking increasingly likely to be divided between the Tajik, Uzbek and Hazara north and the Pashtun
south, either formally, with a partition, or more likely, to slip into inter-ethnic civil war, with India supporting and arming
the north and Pakistan the south.
As diplomacy gathers pace, the Afghan Taliban, who already control over 70 per cent of the country. continue to
increase their power. The most worrying development has been the spread of Taliban units to the previously peaceful
north, where they have taken over pockets of Pathan settlement around Kunduz and Badakhshan. The death of the
British aid worker Karen Woo on 5 August was a direct result.
In Pakistan. too, jihadi activity is growing. Last year there were 87 suicide attacks across the country, killing roughly
3,000 people and the ISI this week stated that, for the first time in the nation's history, it regarded home-grown Islamic
militants to be a bigger threat to the integrity of the nation than India. Yet the army continues to obsess about India. In a
recent speech, Kayani emphasised that although the army knows the dangers of militancy, it was against Indian attacks
that he was principally focused. At a time when Pakistan's economy is in crisis, electricity supply increasingly erratic and
the educational system in complete breakdown, Kayani has secured a huge increase in the country's defence budget.
It is not a pretty picture: growing violence everywhere, increasing Indo-Pak tensions and a defeat for western interests in
the region. Worst of all, because the Pakistani army regards this as a major triumph, it is unlikely to change its policy any
time soon.

Obama was too cautious in fearful times
By Martin Wolf
Published: Au• ust 31 2010 22:48 j Last updated: August 31 2010 22:48
Suppose that the US presidential election of 1932 had, in fact, taken place in 1930, at an early stage in the Great
Depression. Suppose, too, that Franklin Delano Roosevelt had won then, though not by the landslide of 1932. How
different subsequent events might have been. The president might have watched helplessly as output and employment
collapsed. The decades of Democratic dominance might not have happened.
On such chances the wheel of history turns. But this time was different: the crisis brought Barack Obama to power close
to the beginning of the economic collapse. I (among others) then argued that policy needed to be hugely aggressive. Alas,
it was not. I noted on February 4 2009, at the beginning of the new presidency: ""Instead of an overwhelming fiscal
stimulus, what is emerging is too small, too wasteful and too ill-focused."" A week later, I asked: ""Has Barack Obama's
presidency already failed? In normal times, this would be a ludicrous question. But these are not normal times. They are
times of great danger. Today, the new US administration can disown responsibility for its inheritance; tomorrow, it will own
it. Today, it can offer solutions; tomorrow it will have become the problem. Today, it is in control of events; tomorrow,
events will take control of it. Doing too little is now far riskier than doing too much."" This was right.
The direction of policy was not wrong: policymakers — though not all economists — had learnt a great deal from the 1930s.
Sensible people knew that aggressive monetary and fiscal expansion was needed, together with reconstruction of the
financial sector.
But, as Larry Summers, Mr Obama's chief economic adviser, had said: ""When markets overshoot, policymakers must
overshoot too"". Unfortunately, the administration failed to follow his excellent advice. This has allowed opponents to claim
that policy has been ineffective when it has merely been inadequate.
In consequence, the administration has lost credibility with the public and the chances of a renewed fiscal expansion have
disappeared. With the Federal Reserve cautious, too, the likelihood of a lengthy period of weak growth and heavy
joblessness is high. So, too, are the chances of domestic and global political friction.
True, the idea that the policies adopted in the last few months of the Bush administration and the first months of this one
were far better than nothing is weirdly controversial in the US. A recent paper by Alan Blinder, former vice-chairman of the
Fed, and Mark Zandi of Moody's argues that such critics are wrong. They use a standard macro-economic model to
assess what would have happened without any intervention, without the financial interventions (including monetary policy)
and without the fiscal action. They conclude that the peak to trough decline in gross domestic product would have been
close to 12 per cent with no policy response, compared to an actual decline of just 4 per cent (see chart). Similarly, the
unemployment rate would have peaked at 16.5 per cent, instead of the actual 10 per cent. The bigger collapse would also
have meant a fiscal deficit of $2,600bn in fiscal year 2011. The outcome is also disastrous with the modest fiscal response
but no financial •olic res•onse. It is a little better the other way round.
The implication that the modest stimulus package of February 2009 — a mere 5.7 per cent of 2009 GDP, spread over
several years — made a positive contribution is supported by the analysis of the Congressional Budget Office: it argues
that in 2010, US GDP will be between 1.5 per cent and 4.1 per cent higher and the unemployment rate between 0.7 and
1.8 percentage points lower, as a result of the package.
Panglossians who believe the private economy is always in equilibrium, unless governments intervene, disagree. I wish
there were some way to run this experiment without hurting hundreds of millions of people. But I find the idea that allowing
the collapse of much of the financial system, avoiding unconventional monetary policy and struggling to close the fiscal
deficit would have been consistent with a more rapid and sustained recovery quite bizarre.
A fascinating perspective does come, however, from comparisons with what happened in other advanced countries. The
recession in US output (and so demand) has been relatively small, but the decline in employment has been exceptionally
large, as a result of an extraordinary surge in US productivity (see charts). This contrast between what would happen to
output and what would happen to employment was missed in the initial Congressional Budget Office analysis of the
stimulus.
Since the US was the epicentre of the financial crisis, the relatively small decline in output is remarkable. Moreover, since
fiscal and monetary stimuli bear directly on demand and output, not jobs, this is a policy success. At the same time, the
enthusiasm with which US managers laid off workers is also extraordinary. No doubt, some of this is due to the collapse in
construction. But some of it must be due to the ease with which US companies can lay off workers and the incentives for
managers to maintain profits in a downturn at the expense of jobs.
Debate is emerging on how much of the surge in unemployment is structural. My answer, from European experience, is
that one way to ensure it becomes structural is to let it linger. In the short run, the simplest way to prevent that from
happening is to expand demand and so output. Since there is huge slack in the labour market, not the slightest threat of
inflation — far more a risk of deflation — and no constraint from bond or foreign exchange markets on further monetary and
fiscal stimulus, these are the policies that have to be pursued. Yet, alas, the Fed seems to have decided to fall asleep and
the administration has lost the initiative.
So what is going to happen? I assume that, after the midterm elections, resurgent Republicans will offer new tax cuts and
ignore the fiscal deficits. They will pretend that this has nothing to do with any reviled stimulus, though it is much the same
thing — increasing fiscal deficits, thereby offsetting private frugality. That would put the administration on the spot. It would
have to choose between vetoing the tax cuts and accepting them, so allowing the Republicans to get the credit for their
""yacht and mansion-led"" recovery. Any recovery is better than none. But it could have been much better than this. Those
who were cautious when they should have been bold will pay a big price.

Neera Tanden: How °barna Can Win the Battle Over the Economy
What Will It Tate For the Left to Rally Behind Obama Again?
Tanden: Why Liberal Dissatisfaction With Obarna Is Way Overblown
Last week, as Democratic candidates across the country reached out to female voters in the final swing
before Election Day. the White House released a report on how
The report highlights the Obama's administration's efforts and accomplishments on behalf of
.‘vomen's economic success—small business expansion that helps female business owners, jobs tax credits
that help women (and lnera) find jobs, and laws to enforce equal pay for equal work„ among other
initiatives. Yet the report passed with little fanfare and even less media attention—like so many other
aspects of the president's remarkably pro-woman policy agenda.
It's almost tragic how this agenda has fallen under the radar during Obama's first two years in office. We
hear too often about abortion's controversial role in the year-long health care negotiations—but not
enough about other women-centered issues that, after being promoted by activists for years, have finally
made it into legislation. These go beyond the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. The American Reinvestment
and Recovery Act dramatically expanded child care provisions and Head Start. The health cafe bill
contained over $i billion to support nurses visiting new and expectant mothers at home, a program that
women's groups and economists alike have championed as a smart investment. An even bigger victory is
the CLASS Act, also part of the health care bill, which provides a basic cash benefit to people (often
women) who are taking care of the elderly at home.
Yet I can probably count on my hand the number of people, including women, who actually know about
these new laws. Amid the din of bad news about the economy and misinformation about health care
reform, these policies don't stand a chance, sadly, of getting much media coverage. it doesn't help that the
Democrats haven't done enough to shine a public spotlight on them.
But they could soon be lost in an even deeper abyss: The rampant individualism and free-market
fundamentalism support-ed by the Republican Party, which seems on the 1
.Drecipice of controlling -die
House and possibly the Senate, could undo these initiatives entirely. What's more, the new Republiicpm
wave could mute the voice of women and their most important advocates on the national stage.
The Ten Parties, fueled by wealthy multimillionaires, are running extreme candidates—including
women like Sharron Angie and Christine O'Donnell—who want to get rid of policies that help women the
most. If the health care bill gets repealed, for instance, the new provisions for !ong-term care would go out
the window, making decades worth of advocacy work moot.
But the Tea Parties threaten women in other ways, too. .ff the Republicans take back the _House, the
Democratic Party will lose one of its most powerful women: Speaker Nanc,
„' Pelosi, who currently has more
clout than any woman on the other side of the aisle, Meanwhile, Republicans like Sarah Palin and Nikki
Haley will only gain political power—and, with that .power, attract more attention to their extreme views.
If these Republicans become the nation's loudest voices of seemingly strong women, that could portend
for a shift among younger women's allegiances toward the Republican Party and its platform.
Already, despite the stark realities about what Republicans will likely take away from women once. they are
in power, we are seeing rumbling of such a change: After forming the backbone of Democratic majorities
for years, working-class women are wobbling in theii support the the Obama administration. According to
a fron. last week, while femaie college graduates savor Democratic over
Republican control (56 percent to 36 percent), women With only some college or a vocational education
are running almost even k A • '
Perhaps, in their growing economic anxiety, this group of women wafits to throw out incumbents they
perceive have not sufficiently focused on their economic progress. But, of course, if the media paid more
attention to Obama's pro-woman agenda—and both advocates and policymakers did more to broadcast
it—these key voters would know that the Democrats, not Republicans, are the politicians who have their
interests in mind.
Democrats can't let this continue—they can't allow Republicans to brand themselves as the party of strong
female leaders, or allow women to gradually become a constituency of the right. That's why it's critical to
have standout women in the party. If Pelosi loses, is there a powerful enough Democratic woman to
compete with these Republicans in the national spotlight? There's Hillary Clinton who, as Secretary of
State, has sent a powerful signal to the country and the world about the importance of female leadership in
the Obama administration, But, as a technically non-partisan international figure, Hillary won't be able to
do public battle with the rising right,
Perhaps a Governor Sink—if she wins—in Florida could be among a new class of strong female Democrats.
The °barna administration would also do well to elevate v.,/onien in the exe.cutive branch and turn public
attention to those who are already there.
In addition to •presenting women as the face of the patty, Democrats must focus on issues like long-term
care, child care, and equal pay, all of which could rise to the legislatle fore in the coming months.
Republicans will likely directly attack or cut beck investments in these initiatives. When this happens, the
White House (and Democrats more broadly) would be wise to e.:;olain what ili niean for women if these
i •
nitiatives are gutted or lost—and to fight tooth and nail to make s-a•.e that doesn't happen.
If it doesn't take these steps, the Democratic Party could lose ts grasr on a cr3-ni‘al. Pveii central 7-,eit of its

do nothing to value families.

To say that the American people are angry is an understatement. The political brain of Americans today reflects a volatile
mixture of fear and fury, and when you mix those together, you get an explosion. The only question at this point is how to
mitigate the damage when the bomb detonates in November.
The bad news is that it's too late for Democrats to do what would have been both good policy and good politics (and what
the House actually did do), namely to pass a major jobs bill when it was clear that the private sector couldn't keep
Americans employed. The ""Obama Doctrine"" should have been that Americans who want to work and have the ability to
contribute to our productivity as a nation should have the right to work, and that if the private sector can't meet the
demand for jobs, we have plenty of roads and bridges to fix, new energy sources to develop and manufacture, and
schools to build and renovate so our kids and workers returning for training can compete in the 21st century global
economy. From having spent much of the last four years testing messages on a range of issues, from immigration to
taxes and deficits, I can say with some certainty that nothing John Boehner or Eric Cantor could say could come within 30
points of generating the enthusiasm -- particularly among swing voters -- of a message that began, ""We don't have a
shortage of work ethic in this country, we have a shortage of work."" That message resonates across the political
spectrum. And it isn't even the strongest message we've tested in the last weeks or months that beats back the toughest
deficit-cutting language the other side can muster.
But it's too late for that. The administration opted for an alternative doctrine, which Larry Summers enunciated on This
Week several months ago: that unemployment is going to remain high for the foreseeable future and eventually come
down -- as if there's nothing we can do about it -- and that they will push here and there for small symbolic measures
whose symbolism tends to escape people who are out of work. It's hard to be excited by symbolism when your children
are hungry or the bank is repossessing your home -- although you didn't do anything to deserve it -- while the people who
did are once again making out like bandits.
Although the situation looks bleak for Democrats in November, it ain't over 'til it's over. Republicans are shooting
themselves in the foot all over the country, running Tea Party candidates who are so far to the right you can't see Middle
America from their porch. And some endangered Democrats will likely see victory in November from theirs if they
understand the public mood and speak to it.
What is that public mood? It can be characterized by a single phrase -- populist anger -- and it cuts across partisan lines.
On the right, it is alloyed with racial anxiety and prejudice. On the left, it is alloyed with tremendous disappointment at
what could have been if we had the kind of bold leadership for which times like these cry out. And among people in the
vast political center, populist anger is alloyed with anxiety and uncertainty -- about their jobs, their homes, and their
children's future.
How to Create a Populist Explosion: A Tragedy in Two Acts
So how did we get here? The story can be told as a tragedy in two acts.
Act I: The GOP Sets the Country on a Course of Economic Destruction and the President Calls for Truth and
Reconciliation without the Truth Part
• A strong economic downturn devolves into a Great Recession, as the stock market crashes and major banks fail.
By October 2008, upper middle class moderate Republicans in the suburbs are so frightened by what's happening
to their assets that they're willing to give Democrats a chance.
• A Republican administration that believes in neither government nor regulation creates a 700 billion bank bailout
with no accountability. Unlike Republicans, who would say ""no"" in a situation like this and let a Great Recession
turn into a Great Depression, Democrats do the right thing, but they don't make it clear from the start that these
are Bush Bailouts and remind Americans, over and over, that the cause of all the bankruptcies is the bankruptcy
of Republican ideology.
• A charismatic young president raises people's hopes and expectations, as he uniquely can. Americans are
frightened, but they are willing and waiting to hear an alternative narrative to ""government is the problem, not the
solution"" and a path back to economic recovery and security.
• The White House refuses to tell the American people three stories they desperately need to hear.
• The first is why the economy has gone into the ditch, and who did it. The president is steadfast in his position that
we should ""look forward, not backward,"" even as the GOP is blocking his every initiative to clean up its mess. As
conservative attacks on him and Democrats increase, he refuses to indict the Republicans in Congress or
President Bush for having destroyed our economy and putting one in eight Americans out of work and one in five
either behind on their mortgage or in the process of having their homes foreclosed by the same bankers who
gambled them away. Why did he need to tell the American people who was responsible for their misery -- and to
repeat it again and again? Because otherwise, if the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression didn't
subside within a year and half, voters would start to associate it with him and his party. This is Neuroscience 101 -
- it's how mental associations are formed. But the president never even uttered George W. Bush's name in his
first year in office, and the first time he did mention Bush was to appoint him, along with former President Clinton,
to co-lead American relief efforts in Haiti. The president doesn't like putting antagonists in any of his stories, but if
forced to, he would cite unnamed ""naysayers,"" ""Washington politics as usual,"" or ""Congress,"" which was
counterproductive given that Congress was held by his party. The guiding belief at the White House implicit in this
messaging strategy was that Americans have a good grasp on economics and good memories:
• The second story the American people needed to hear from the president was why deficit spending is essential
when the economy is spiraling downward. It's not a hard story to tell, even in a sound bite. But one of the best
educators to occupy the Oval Office in decades chose not to educate -- he actually did it once, with prodding, but
never repeated what was a superb explanation --- nor did he remind voters every time his opponents attacked
him for deficit spending that they had left him with a 1.2 trillion dollar deficit on the day he walked into office
because of their unpaid-for tax cuts to millionaires and unpaid-for war on Iraq that called on no one to sacrifice
except our soldiers and their families (and our kids and grandkids, who will be paying off this war for generations).
A year later, with Democrats on the ropes, the president started to tell that story. It was the right move, but
appeared defensive because it hadn't been part of his guiding narrative from the start.
• The third story the president needed to offer was an alternative narrative on government. The president and his
party were about to offer effective government as a solution to multiple problems after 30 years of solid branding
by conservatives since Ronald Reagan about how government is the problem. But the narrative never came.
• The White House and Democratic Congress pass what virtually all economists outside the Goldman Sachs-to-
Washington pipeline consider a half-stimulus that they predict will likely produce half-results. It fulfilled its promise.
But the equally predictable political result was a discrediting of the concept of government intervention to
stimulate the economy in the eyes of the public -- enough to scare off Democratic lawmakers from doing what
they learned about Keynesian economics in intro economics for the indefinite future. Instead of blasting the
Republicans for having hurled the country toward an abyss that would now take drastic measures to avert and
warning the American people that this could easily be the first of two or three trillion-dollar packages that might be
needed to get Americans back to work and to get the gears of the economy grinding again before we could start
returning to the kinds of surpluses Bill Clinton had left the last time a Democrat was in the White House, the
president chose to compromise with a party that was so unpopular when he took office that only 20 percent of
voters at that point would even admit to a pollster that they considered themselves Republicans -- the lowest point
for the GOP since the rise of public opinion polling 50 years earlier.
• The economy continues its free-fall, shedding 700,000 jobs a month. Meanwhile, Democrats don't take the kind of
dramatic steps necessary to stop the bleeding. Americans are becoming desperate, but they remain hopeful that
this new president will turn things around, and that perhaps the jobs provisions of the new ""stimulus"" act will do
cauterize the wound. Meanwhile, the stimulus is being portrayed by Republicans as a mixture of pork and fat, and
no one is effectively answering the charges, creating increasingly negative associations to an act that was never
adequately crafted or sold.
• The logical follow-up to a bill designed to pull the economy out of a ditch is to make such a bill unnecessary in the
future, by attacking Wall Street for having thrown us into crisis and passing strong legislation to rein in the
excesses that created the economic meltdown. This would have sealed the American people's loyalty to the new
president and Congress. (Heading into November, this is, in fact, the most popular piece of legislation the
Democrats have passed, but it took them nearly a year and a half to get there, and by then, neither the president
nor the Democratic Congress enjoyed the good will of the average American.) Instead, the same banks that
received bailouts are foreclosing in record rates on the homeowners whose payroll taxes funded the bailouts but
don't seem to get the same kind of attention to their needs from the federal government. Adding insult to injury,
the banks double and triple credit card interest rates to as high as 30 percent, including on people's existing credit
card debt -- while continuing to receive no-interest loans from the federal government.
• Despite talk of accountability, no one is fired (except one auto executive), virtually no one is prosecuted or even
investigated as far as anyone knows, and banks that received bailouts flaunt record bonuses.
Act II: An Anemic Economy Meets an Anemic Health Care Plan
• The public has been clamoring for health care reform. Over 40 million people don't have health insurance at all,
and the 85 percent of voters who do have health care have seen their costs double during the Bush years at the
same time as real income has declined. Effective narratives on health care are widely available that win by a 2:1
margin against the toughest Harry-and-Louise anti-reform language from the other side. The opposition knows it,
as evident in a leaked memo by Republican wordsmith Frank Luntz, who warns that this will be an uphill climb for
opponents of reform, who would do well to accept some major elements of it.
• But instead of using any of the well-tested narratives that were highly effective during the campaign or devising
any new ones of its own, the administration decides to try to ""sell"" health care without a narrative. (I wrote about
this in detail a year ago and will not repeat that history here, except in telegraphic form.) The president refuses to
state where he stands on any of the substantive debates about health reform for a year, such as whether we
should have a ""public option"" (a term so ill-conceived it's hard to believe the public supported it anyway; imagine
the support it might have received if it had been called instead ""the one health care plan the health insurance
companies don't get to control""). Instead, the White House uses phrases such as ""bending the cost curve"" while
conservatives flood the airwaves with evocative phrases such as ""government takeover,"" ""a bureaucrat between
you and your doctor,"" and ""death panels.""
• Instead of using Big Pharma and the health insurance industry as the villains of the health care story, which would
explain why we need an overhaul rather than a Band-Aid, the White House once again offers a story without
protagonists or antagonists, and cuts secret deals with both industries that become public.
• Over interminable months of trying to get the votes of the same Republicans who fought against Medicare for
seniors for 30 years until the program was just too popular to keep attacking it and who are still trying to gut Social
Security despite its popularity, the public then watches what George Will describes as the ""serial bribery"" of
Republican and Democratic Senators alike, as each gets to take his or her turn as the 60th vote.
• At the 11th hour, as a compromise plan is finally going to pass, the president nixes the idea of a Medicare-like
alternative Americans can choose over a health-insurance industry plan if they so desire, despite 60 percent of
even swing voters wanting it included in the bill.
• Instead of being the signature bill that demonstrates both that Democrats can govern effectively and that
government can be a force for good for working and middle class Americans (who have just been told that the
better plans they've negotiated or been offered for years by their employers are ""Cadillacs"" that are going to be
taxed out of existence), the entire process proves to the average American that government can't do anything
right and scares moderate Democrats away from voting for any other bill that would ever put them on the record
supporting government or spending.
• ""Government"" hits an all-time low in the polls, matching the popularity of big corporations, CEOs, and bailouts.
• Populist anger emerges as the primary emotion across the political spectrum, and the president's job approval
with swing voters drops into the high thirties.
• Following the conventional wisdom, Democrats return to their all-too-familiar defensive crouch, and conclude that
when in trouble, tack right. On health care, the president and his Cabinet fan out all over television to ""reassure""
the public on health care that abortion won't be covered (thanks for the reassurance, but most of us didn't find that
reassuring), that domestic partners won't be covered, and that immigrants won't be covered. None of these issues
needed to be conceded. (I know this because I tested messages on them, and well- messaged progressive
positions on them would have boosted the popularity of the bill with swing voters.)
• The White House starts adopting failed conservative policies and talking points that leave the public utterly
confused about where the president, and by extension, his party, stands on the central issues of the day. The
president talks about cutting deficits and increasing spending in the same breath, using the metaphor of families
tightening their belt in tough times, which only strengthens resolve against stimulating a faltering economy;
pledges support for massively expanding offshore drilling and ""clean coal"" (which doesn't exist, by the way) in a
speech on climate change; and sends in 1200 additional National Guards to Arizona as an apparent reward for
passing ""No Latino Left Behind,"" while publicly objecting to the legislation.
• The underlying psychological assumption of these moves is that if you mix policies from the right and left in equal
parts, you win the center. In fact, no one has ever won the center that way. It appears weak, opportunistic, and
incoherent to the average swing voter, which is particularly problematic at a time when people in the center
desperately want to know that their leaders have a vision and a coherent plan for what to do (which is why both
FDR and Ronald Reagan were so effective in moving voters in the center). It doesn't win any votes on the right.
But it does have one predictable effect: It sucks the motivation out of your base, who feel demoralized and
betrayed (if they're part of the ""professional left"") or less likely to vote (if they're average voters who don't follow
politics carefully but just don't feel very enthusiastic anymore, even if they don't really know why).
• Capping it all off, the BP disaster occurs two weeks after the president has adopted the ""drill here, drill now,"" ""all
of the above"" position of the Republican Party and the oil companies. This could have been the perfect
opportunity to go on the offensive, contrast what Democrats stand for (common sense, protection of our safety,
the land we leave our children, and key American industries and jobs, and sticking up for ordinary Americans
against big businesses and their lobbyists) with what Republicans stand for; and connect the dots between what
happened on Wall Street (with regulators owned and operated by the companies they were supposed to regulate)
and what happened in the Gulf (where precisely the same thing happened). Instead, the administration finds itself
on the defensive, increasingly sounding like a subsidiary of BP, allowing BP to call the shots and control
information for weeks, defending increasingly hard-to-believe statistics, and issuing press releases that appear
indistinguishable from those issued by BP but are inconsistent with assessments of independent scientists.
Where Do We Go from Here?
So that is where we find ourselves today: a Democratic Party and Democratic base that is demoralized and unlikely to
vote in high numbers in November; a Republican Party that is selling replanted Bushes with tremendous enthusiasm; and
a vast political center filled with voters who are utterly confused and unsure who to turn to but certain that things aren't
going well.
In January 2009 no one could have predicted that Democrats would be in this predicament today. Perhaps Democrats
might lose a few seats lost in an off-year election, but certainly no more than that. We had just seen -- and the American
public knew we had just seen -- the most disastrous performance by a president and party in living history, and the
American people had elected a tremendously charismatic young president with enormous Democratic majorities in both
houses of Congress. They had given the president and Congress a strong mandate for whatever kind of change was
necessary to get us out of economic free-fall and to put Americans back to work.
But there were red flags already by the end of Obama's first week in office that led me to offer the following advice to the
new administration: Tell the story of how we got in this mess or you'll own it. Tell a coherent story about deficit spending.
Re-brand government because there's only one story out there now (Reagan's), and it's not one that supports a
progressive agenda. Never let attacks go unanswered, because doing so only emboldens your opposition and leads the
public to believe that you have no answers to them. And if you throw a bipartisan party and no one comes, don't throw
another one. All of what followed has been as predictable as it has been unfortunate. A year and a half later, the White
House hasn't consistently done any of these things, although the President is now intermittently doing some of them, and
when he does, he does them well.
The question today is whether Democrats can channel the populist anger we are seeing around the country this late in the
game. The answer is that we'd better try. Having recently tested messages on economics and jobs, including how to talk
about deficits and taxes -- widely assumed to be Democrats' Achilles Heel, particularly now -- there is little question that if
Democrats and progressives from center to left simply say what they believe in ways that are evocative, values-driven,
and speak to people's worries and 'anger, many stand a good chance of surviving November, particularly when their
opponents have nothing to say other than warmed-over rhetoric about cutting taxes to millionaires and multinationals and
fiscal restraint except where it cuts into profits of their campaign contributors. Even the most evocative boilerplate
conservative messages fall flat against honest messages that speak to the need to get Americans working again. And on
issue after issue, no message is more resonant right now than one that sides with working and middle class Americans
and small business owners against special interests, big business, and their lobbyists.
But actions speak louder than words, and Americans want to see action. It may be too late for the kind of jobs bill we
should have seen a year and a half ago, but it isn't too late for Democrats to go on the offensive against the Republicans -
- virtually all of them -- who opposed extending unemployment insurance to millions of Americans who were thrown out of
work by the Republicans' corporate sponsors. It isn't too late for Democrats to contrast their support for the highly popular
aid to state and local governments that just saved the jobs of hundreds of thousands of teachers, firefighters, and police
all over the country with Republicans' desire to throw them out onto the street. It isn't too late to make a voting issue out of
the bill the Republicans are stalling that would give small businesses a fighting chance in an economy stacked against
them, and to make clear that one party stands for small businesses, which create 75 percent of the new jobs in this
country, and the other party stands for big businesses that outsource American jobs and offshore their profits to avoid
paying their fair share of American taxes. It's not too late to pass a bill that would limit credit card interest rates to a
reasonable percent above the rate at which credit is made available to credit card companies. It's not too late to pass the
first badly need ""fix"" to the health care reform act to demonstrate to Americans that Democrats mean it when they say this
was just the first step, namely a law that stops insurance companies from increasing their premiums by 40 percent while
cutting the size of their networks by 50-75 percent, which violates the principles of affordability and choice that were so
essential to efforts to sell health care reform to the public. It's not too late to vow to change the rules of the Senate to
prevent the use of the filibuster to give every special interest veto power over every important piece of legislation. It's not
too late to introduce legislation that's been on hold in both the House and Senate to guarantee fair elections, so that the
voice of everyday Americans is heard over the voice of the special interests that finance political campaigns.
On every one of these issues, a strong populist message trounces anything the other side can say. But Democrats need
to play offense. They need to take up-or-down votes on bill after bill, including those they expect the other side to block,
knowing that every one of those votes has the leverage of a campaign ad behind it. They need to change the narrative
from what sounds to the average American like a whiny and impotent one -- ""the Republicans won't let us do it"" -- to a
narrative of strength in numbers shared with their constituents. And they need to make every election a choice between
two well-articulated approaches to governance -- and to offer their articulation of both sides' positions and values.
That leads to a final point. What Democrats have needed to offer the American people is a clear narrative about what and
who led our country to the mess in which we find ourselves today and a clear vision of what and who will lead us out. That
narrative would have laid a roadmap for our elected officials and voters alike, rather than making each legislative issue a
seemingly discrete turn onto a dirt road. That narrative might have included -- and should include today -- some key
elements: that if the economy is tumbling, it's the role of leadership and government to stop the free-fall; that if Wall Street
is gambling with our financial security, our homes, and our jobs, true leaders do not sit back helplessly and wax eloquent
aboUt the free market, they take away the dice; that if the private sector can't create jobs for people who want to work,
then we'll put Americans back to work rebuilding our roads, bridges, and schools; that if Big Oil is preventing us from
competing with China's wind and solar energy programs, then we'll eliminate the tax breaks that lead to dysfunctional
investments in 19th century fuels and have a public-private partnership with companies that will create the clean, safe
fuels of the 21st century and the millions of good American jobs that will follow.
That's what Democrats stand for. It's time they said it.

SouthCom's announcement:
USS IWO JIMA DEPLOYS TO HAITI AS TROPICAL STORM APPROACHES
MIAMI - U.S. Southern Command directed the amphibious ship USS Iwo Jima (LHD 7) to steam toward Haiti today in
preparation for the forecasted arrival of tropical storm Tomas later this week.
Iwo Jima will deploy to Haiti from Suriname, where it arrived Thursday on its final country visit for Continuing Promise
2010, a four-month, humanitarian civic assistance deployment to eight nations in the Caribbean region. The ship is
scheduled to arrive in Haiti later this week.
Large amphibious ships, like Iwo Jima, resemble small aircraft carriers and include the ability to support helicopter and
landing craft operations to quickly move personnel and cargo, making it an ideal platform to support humanitarian-relief
missions on short notice.
A crew of 1,600 military and civilian medical, engineering, aviation, logistical and other support personnel are embarked
aboard Iwo Jima, including U.S. Navy engineers, a contingent of 500 Marines with logistical-support expertise,
volunteers from the U.S. Public Health Service and various non-governmental organizations (NG0s), as well as medical,
dental and engineering professionals from Europe, North America and South America.
Eight CH-46 Sea Knight, medium-lift, dual-rotor helicopters; two MH-60 Knight Hawk helicopters and two amphibious
landing craft units (ICU's) are on Iwo Jima to support the ship's operations.
Iwo Jima is a Wasp-class amphibious ship capable of speeds in excess of
20 knots that can provide robust ship-to-shore, as well as shore-to-shore logistics support during contingencies ranging
from traditional military operations to humanitarian and disaster-relief missions.
Because of the Caribbean region's history of severe-weather events during the peak months of the hurricane season, the
ship has remained in the area throughout its present deployment, ready to support U.S.
disaster relief efforts when directed.
Iwo Jima was in Port-de-Paix, Haiti, from July 24 through Aug. 3. It was the first stop on CP10 and the crew provided
medical assistance to more than 4,000 Haitian citizens, performed 32 surgeries, completed six engineering projects, and
delivered 231 pallets of humanitarian-assistance supplies donated by NG0s.
In September 2008, the amphibious ship USS Kearsarge deployed to Haiti to support U.S. relief efforts after a succession
of storms (Fay, Gustav, Hanna and Ike) devastated the country. Kearsarge provided robust air and sealift support,
delivering 3.3 million pounds of food, water and other aid to communities impacted by the disasters.

Remarks to staff of the Royal Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs
and, separately, to members of the Norwegian Institute of International Affairs
Ambassador Chas W. Freeman, Jr. (USFS, Ret.)
1 September 2010, Oslo, Norway
You have asked me to speak to current American policies in the Middle East, with an emphasis on the prospects for
peace in the Holy Land. You have further suggested that I touch on the relationship of the Gulf Arabs, especially Saudi
Arabia, to this. It is both an honor and a challenge to address this subject in this capital / at this ministry.
The declaration of principles worked out in Oslo seventeen years ago was the last direct negotiation between Israelis and
Palestinian Arabs to reach consequential, positive results. The Oslo accords were a real step toward peace, not another
deceptive pseudo-event in an endlessly unproductive, so-called ""peace process."" And if that one step forward in Oslo in
1993 was followed by several steps backwards, there is a great deal to be learned from how and why that happened.
There can be no doubt about the importance of today's topic. The ongoing conflict in the Holy Land increasingly disturbs
the world's conscience as well as its tranquility. The Israel-Palestine issue began as a struggle in the context of European
colonialism. In the post-colonial era, tension between Israelis and the Palestinians they dispossessed became, by
degrees, the principal source of radicalization and instability in the Arab East and then the Arab world as a whole. It
stimulated escalating terrorism against Israelis at home and their allies abroad. Since the end of the Cold War, the
interaction between Israel and its captive Palestinian population has emerged as the fountainhead of global strife. It is
increasingly difficult to distinguish this strife from a war of religions or a conflict of civilizations.
For better or ill, my own country, the United States has played and continues to play the key international part in this
contest. American policies, more than those of any other external actor, have the capacity to stoke or stifle the hatreds in
the Middle East and to spread or reverse their infection of the wider world. American policies and actions in the Middle
East thus affect much more than that region.
Yet, as I will argue, the United States has been obsessed with process rather than substance. It has failed to involve
parties who are essential to peace. It has acted on Israel's behalf to preempt rather than enlist international and regional
support for peace. It has defined the issues in ways that preclude rather than promote progress. Its concept of a ""peace
process"" has therefore become the handmaiden of Israeli expansionism rather than a driver for peace. There are
alternatives to tomorrow's diplomatic peace pageant on the Potomac. And, as Norway has shown, there is a role for
powers other than America in crafting peace in the Holy Land.
Over thirty years ago, at Camp David, Jimmy Carter pushed Israel through the door to peace that Egypt's Anwar Sadat
had opened. Twenty years ago, the first Bush administration pressed Israel to the negotiating table with Palestinian
leaders, setting the stage for their clandestine meetings in Oslo. The capacity of the United States to rally other
governments behind a cause that it espouses may have atrophied, but American power remains far greater than that of
any other nation. Nowhere is this more evident than in the Middle East.
For more than four decades, Israel has been able to rely on aid from the United States to dominate its region militarily and
to sustain its economic prosperity. It has counted on its leverage in American politics to block the application of
international law and to protect itself from the political repercussions of its policies and actions. Unquestioning American
support has enabled Israel to put the seizure of ever more land ahead of the achievement of a modus vivendi with the
Palestinians or other Arabs. Neither violent resistance from the dispossessed nor objections from abroad have brought
successive Israeli governments to question, let alone alter the priority they assign to land over peace.
Ironically, Palestinians too have developed a dependency relationship with America. This has locked them into a political
framework over which Israel exercises decisive influence. They have been powerless to end occupation, pogroms, ethnic
cleansing, and other humiliations by Jewish soldiers and settlers. Nor have they been able to prevent their progressive
confinement in checkpoint-encircled ghettos on the West Bank and the great open-air prison of Gaza.
Despite this appalling record of failure, the American monopoly on the management of the search for peace in Palestine
remains unchallenged. Since the end of the Cold War, Russia — once a contender for countervailing influence in the
region — has lapsed into impotence. The former colonial powers of the European Union, having earlier laid the basis for
conflict in the region, have largely sat on their hands while ringing them, content to let America take the lead. China,
India, and other Asian powers have prudently kept their political and military distance. In the region itself, Iran has
postured and exploited the Palestinian cause without doing anything to advance it. Until recently, Turkey remained aloof.
On rare occasions, as in the case of the 1973 Arab oil embargo, the Arabs have backed their verbal opposition to Israel
with action. Egypt and Jordan have settled into an unpopular coexistence with Israel that is now sustained only by U.S.
subventions. Saudi Arabia has twice taken the initiative to offer Israel diplomatic concessions if it were to conclude
arrangements for peaceful coexistence with the Palestinians. But, overall, Arab governments have earned the contempt
of the Palestinians and their own people for their lack of serious engagement. For the most part, Arab leaders have
timorously demanded that America solve the Israel-Palestine problem for them, while obsequiously courting American
protection against Israel, each other, Iran, and — in some cases — their own increasingly frustrated and angry subjects and
citizens.
Islam charges rulers with the duty to defend the faithful and to uphold justice. It demands that they embody
righteousness. The resentment of mostly Muslim Arabs at their governing elites' failure to meet these standards
generates sympathy for terrorism directed not just at Israel but at both the United States and Arab governments
associated with it.
The perpetrators of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attack on the United States saw it in part as reprisal for American
complicity in Israeli cruelties to Palestinians and other Arabs. They justified it as a strike against Washington's protection
of Arab governments willing to overlook American contributions to Muslim suffering. Washington's response to the attack
included suspending its efforts to make peace in the Holy Land as well as invading and occupying Afghanistan and
Iraq. All three actions inadvertently strengthened the terrorist case for further attacks on America and its allies. The
armed struggle between Americans and Muslim radicals has already spilled over to Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia, and other
countries. Authoritative voices in Israel now call for adding Iran to the list of countries at war with America. They are
echoed by Zionist and neo-conservative spokesmen in the United States,
The widening involvement of Americans in combat in Muslim lands has inflamed anti-American passions and catalyzed a
metastasis of terrorism. It has caused a growing majority of the world's 1.6 billion Muslims to see the United States as a
menace to their faith, their way of life, their homelands, and their personal security. American populists and European
xenophobes have meanwhile undercut liberal and centrist Muslim arguments against the intolerance that empowers
terrorism by equating terrorism and its extremist advocates with Islam and its followers. The current outburst of bigoted
demagoguery over the construction of an Islamic cultural center and mosque in New York is merely the most recent
illustration of this. It suggests that the blatant racism and Islamophobia of contemporary Israeli politics is contagious. It
rules out the global alliances against religious extremists that are essential to encompass their political defeat.
President Obama's inability to break this pattern must be an enormous personal disappointment to him. He came into
office committed to crafting a new relationship with the Arab and Muslim worlds. His first interview with the international
media was with Arab satellite television. He reached out publicly and privately to Iran. He addressed the Turkish
parliament with persuasive empathy. He traveled to a great center of Islamic learning in Cairo to deliver a remarkably
eloquent message of conciliation to Muslims everywhere. He made it clear that he understood the centrality of injustices
in the Holy Land to Muslim estrangement from the West. He promised a responsible withdrawal from Iraq and a judicious
recrafting of strategy in Afghanistan. Few doubt Mr. Obama's sincerity. Yet none of his initiatives has led to policy
change anyone can detect, let alone believe in
It is not for me to analyze or explain the wide gaps between rhetoric and achievement in the Obama Administration's
stewardship of so many aspects of my country's affairs. American voters will render their first formal verdict on this two
months from tomorrow, on the 2nd of November. The situation in the Holy Land, Iraq, Afghanistan, and adjacent areas is
only part of what they will consider as they do so. But I do think it worthwhile briefly to examine some of the changes in
the situation that ensure that many policies that once helped us to get by in the Middle East will no longer do this.
Let me begin with the ""peace process,"" a hardy perennial of America's diplomatic repertoire that the Obama
Administration will put back on public display tomorrow. In the Cold War, the appearance of an earnest and ""even-
handed"" American search for peace in the Holy Land was the price of U.S. access and influence in the Middle East. It
provided political cover for conservative Arab governments to set aside their anger at American backing of Israel so as to
stand with America and the Western bloc against Soviet Communism. It kept American relations with Israel and the
Arabs from becoming a zero-sum game. It mobilized domestic Jewish support for incumbent presidents. Of course, there
hasn't been an American-led ""peace process"" in the Middle East for at least a decade. Still the conceit of a ""peace
process"" became an essential political convenience for all concerned. No one could bear to admit that the ""peace
process"" had expired. It therefore lived on in phantom form.
Even when there was no ""peace process,"" the possibility of resurrecting one provided hope to the gullible, cover to the
guileful, beguilement for the press, an excuse for doing nothing to those gaining from the status quo, and — last but far
from least — lifetime employment for career ""peace processors."" The perpetual processing of peace without the
requirement to produce it has been especially appreciated by Israeli leaders. It has enabled them to behave like
magicians, riveting foreign attention on meaningless distractions as they systematically removed Palestinians from their
homes, settled half a million or more Jews in newly vacated areas of the occupied territories, and annexed a widening
swath of land to a Jerusalem they insist belongs only to Israel.
Palestinian leaders with legitimacy problems have also had reason to collaborate in the search for a ""peace process."" It's
not just that there has been no obviously better way to end their people's suffering. Playing ""peace process"" charades
justifies the international patronage and Israeli backing these leaders need to retain their status in the occupied
territories. It ensures that they have media access and high-level visiting rights in Washington. Meanwhile, for American
leaders, engagement in some sort of Middle East ""peace process"" has been essential to credibility in the Arab and Islamic
worlds, as well as with the ever-generous American Jewish community. Polls show that most American Jews are
impatient for peace. Despite all the evidence to the contrary, they are eager to believe in the willingness of the
government of Israel to trade land for it.
Previous ""peace processes"" have exploited all these impulses. In practice, however, these diplomatic distractions have
served to obscure Israeli actions and evasions that were more often prejudicial to peace than helpful in achieving
it. Behind all the blather, the rumble of bulldozers has never stopped. Given this history, it has taken a year and a half of
relentless effort by U.S. Special Envoy George Mitchell to persuade the parties even to meet directly to talk about talks as
they first did here in Oslo, seventeen years ago. When the curtain goes up on the diplomatic show in Washington
tomorrow, will the players put on a different skit? There are many reasons to doubt that they will.
One is that the Obama administration has engaged the same aging impresarios who staged all the previously failed
""peace processes"" to produce and direct this one with no agreed script. The last time these guys staged such an ill-
prepared meeting, at Camp David in 2000, it cost both heads of delegation, Ehud Barak and Yasser Arafat, their political
authority. It led not to peace but to escalating violence. The parties are showing up this time to minimize President
Obama's political embarrassment in advance of midterm elections in the United States, not to address his agenda — still
less to address each other's agendas. These are indeed difficulties. But the problems with this latest — and possibly final
— iteration of the perpetually ineffectual ""peace process"" are more fundamental.
The Likud Party charter flatly rejects the establishment of a Palestinian Arab state west of the Jordan River and stipulates
that: ""The Palestinians can run their lives freely in the framework of self-rule, but not as an independent and sovereign
state."" This Israeli government is committed to that charter as well as to the Jewish holy war for land in Palestine. It has
no interest in trading land it covets for a peace that might thwart further territorial expansion. It considers itself unbound
by the applicable UN resolutions, agreements from past peace talks, the ""Roadmap,"" or the premise of the ""two-state
solution.""
The Palestinians are desperate for the dignity and security that only the end of the Israeli occupation can provide. But the
authority of Palestinian negotiators to negotiate rests on their recognition by Israel and the United States, not on their
standing in the occupied territories, Gaza, or the Palestinian diaspora. Fatah is the ruling faction in part of Palestine. Its
authority to govern was repudiated by voters in the last Palestinian elections. The Mahmoud Abbas administration retains
power by grace of the Israeli occupation authorities and the United States, which prefer it to the government empowered
by the Palestinian people at the polls. Mr. Abbas's constitutional term of office has long since expired. He presides over
a parliament whose most influential members are locked up in Israeli jails. It is not clear for whom he, his faction, or his
administration can now speak.
So the talks that begin tomorrow promise to be a case of the disinterested going through the motions of negotiating with
the mandate-less. The parties to these talks seek to mollify an America that has severely lessened international
credibility. The United States government had to borrow the modest reputations for objectivity of others — the EU, Russia,
and the UN — to be able to convene this discussion. It will be held under the auspices of an American president who was
publicly humiliated by Israel's prime minister on the issue that is at the center of the Israel-Palestine dispute — Israel's
continuing seizure and colonization of Arab land.
Vague promises of a Palestinian state within a year now waft through the air. But the ""peace process"" has always
sneered at deadlines, even much, much firmer ones. A more definitive promise of an independent Palestine within a year
was made at Annapolis three years ago. Analogous promises of Palestinian self-determination have preceded or resulted
from previous meetings over the decades, beginning with the Camp David accords of 1979. Many in this audience will
recall the five-year deadline fixed at Oslo. The talks about talks that begin tomorrow can yield concrete results only if the
international community is prepared this time to insist on the one-year deadline put forward for recognizing a Palestinian
state. Even then there will be no peace unless long-neglected issues are addressed.
Peace is a pattern of stability acceptable to those with the capacity to disturb it by violence. It is almost impossible to
impose. It cannot become a reality, still less be sustained, if those who must accept it are excluded from it. This reality
directs our attention to who is not at this gathering in Washington and what must be done to remedy the problems these
absences create.
Obviously, the party that won the democratically expressed mandate of the Palestinian people to represent them — Hamas
— is not there. Yet there can be no peace without its buy-in. Egypt and Jordan have been invited as observers. Yet they
have nothing to add to the separate peace agreements each long ago made with Israel. (Both these agreements were
explicitly premised on grudging Israeli undertakings to accept Palestinian self-determination. The Jewish state quickly
finessed both.) Activists from the Jewish diaspora disproportionately staff the American delegation. A failure to reconcile
either American Jews or the Palestine diaspora to peace would doom any accord. But the Palestinian diaspora will be
represented in Washington only in tenuous theory, not in fact.
Other Arabs, including the Arab League and the author of its peace initiative, Saudi Arabia, will not be at the talks
tomorrow. The reasons for this are both simple and complex. At one level they reflect both a conviction that this latest
installment of the ""peace process"" is just another in a long series of public entertainments for the American electorate and
also a lack of confidence in the authenticity of the Palestinian delegation. At another level, they result from the way the
United States has defined the problems to be solved and the indifference to Arab interests and views this definition
evidences. Then too, they reflect disconnects in political culture and negotiating style between Israelis, Arabs, and
Americans.
To begin with, neither Israel nor the conveners of this proposed new ""peace process"" have officially acknowledged or
responded to the Arab peace initiative of 2002. This offered normalization of relations with the Jewish state, should Israel
make peace with the Palestinians. Instead, the United States and the Quartet have seemed to pocket the Arab offer,
ignore its precondition that Israelis come to terms with Palestinians, and gone on to levy new demands.
In this connection, making Arab recognition of Israel's ""right to exist"" the central purpose of the ""peace process"" offends
Arabs on many levels. In framing the issue this way, Israel and the United States appear to be asking for something well
beyond pragmatic accommodation of the reality of a Jewish state in the Middle East. To the Arabs, Americans now seem
to be insisting on Arab endorsement of the idea of the state of Israel, the means by which that state was established, and
the manner in which it has comported itself. Must Arabs really embrace Zionism before Israel can cease expansion and
accept peace?
Arabs and Muslims familiar with European history can accept that European anti-Semitism justified the establishment of a
homeland for traumatized European Jews. But asking them even implicitly to agree that the forcible eviction of
Palestinian Arabs was a morally appropriate means to this end is both a nonstarter and seriously off-putting. So is asking
them to affirm that resistance to such displacement was and is sinful. Similarly, the Arabs see the demand that they
recognize a Jewish state with no fixed borders as a clever attempt to extract their endorsement of Israel's unilateral
expansion at Palestinian expense.
The lack of appeal in this approach has been compounded by a longstanding American habit of treating Arab concerns
about Israel as a form of anti-Semitism and tuning them out. Instead of hearing out and addressing Arab views, U.S.
peace processors have repeatedly focused on soliciting Arab acts of kindness toward Israel. They argue that gestures of
acceptance can help Israelis overcome their Holocaust-inspired political neuroses and take risks for peace.
Each time this notion of Arab diplomacy as psychotherapy for Israelis has been trotted out, it has been met with
incredulity. To most in the region, it encapsulates the contrast between Washington's sympathy and solicitude for Israelis
and its condescendingly exploitative view of Arabs. Some see it as a barely disguised appeal for a policy of appeasement
of Israel. Still others suspect an attempt to construct a ""peace process"" in which Arabs begin to supply Israel with gifts of
carrots so that Americans can continue to avoid applying sticks to it.
The effort to encourage Arab generosity as an offset to American political pusillanimity vis-a-vis Israel is ludicrously
unpersuasive. It has failed so many times that it should be obvious that it will not work. Yet it was a central element of
George Mitchell's mandate for ""peace process"" diplomacy. And it appears to have resurfaced as part of the proposed
follow-up to tomorrow's meeting between the parties in Washington. It should be no puzzle why the Saudis and other
Arabs could not be persuaded to join this gathering.
As a last thought before turning to what must be done, let me make a quick comment on a relevant cultural factor. Arabic
has two quite different words that are both translated as ""negotiation,"" making a distinction that doesn't exist in either
English or Hebrew. One word, ""musaawama,"" refers to the no-holds-barred bargaining process that takes place in
bazaars between strangers who may never see each other again and who therefore feel no obligation not to scam each
other. Another, ""mufaawadhat,"" describes the dignified formal discussions about matters of honor and high principle that
take place on a basis of mutual respect and equality between statesmen who seek a continuing relationship.
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat's travel to Jerusalem was a grand act of statesmanship to initiate a process of
mufaawadhat — relationship-building between leaders and their polities. So was the Arab peace initiative of 2002. It
called for a response in kind. The West muttered approvingly but did not act. After a while, Israel responded with
intermittent, somewhat oblique suggestions of willingness to haggle over terms. But an offer to bicker over the terms on
which a grand gesture has been granted is, not surprisingly, seen as insultingly unresponsive.
I cite this not to suggest that non-Arabs should adopt Arabic canons of thought, but to make a point about diplomatic
effectiveness. To move a negotiating partner in a desired direction, one must understand how that partner understands
things and help him to see a way forward that will bring him to an end he has been persuaded to want. One of the
reasons we can't seem to move things as we desire in the Middle East is that we don't make much effort to understand
how others reason and how they rank their interests. In the case of the Israel-Palestine conundrum, we Americans are
long on empathy and expertise about Israel and very, very short on these for the various Arab parties. The essential
militarism of U.S. policies in the Middle East adds to our difficulties. We have become skilled at killing Arabs. We have
forgotten how to listen to them or persuade them.
I am not myself an ""Arabist,"" but I am old enough to remember when there were more than a few such people in the
American diplomatic service. These were officers who had devoted themselves to the cultivation of understanding and
empathy with Arab leaders so as to be able to convince these leaders that it was in their own interest to do things we saw
as in our interest. If we still have such people, we are hiding them well; we are certainly not applying their skills in our
Middle East diplomacy.
This brings me to a few thoughts about the Western and Arab interests at stake in the Holy Land and their implications for
what must be done.
In foreign affairs, interests are the measure of all things. My assumption is that Americans and Norwegians, indeed
Europeans in general, share common interests that require peace in the Holy Land. To my mind, these interests include -
but are, of course, not limited to — gaining security and acceptance for a democratic state of Israel; eliminating the gross
injustices and daily humiliations that foster Arab terrorism against Israel and its foreign allies and supporters, as well as
friendly Arab regimes; and reversing the global spread of religious strife and prejudice, including, very likely, a revival of
anti-Semitism in the West if current trends are not arrested. None of these aspirations can be fulfilled without an end to
the Israeli occupation and freedom for Palestinians.
Arab states, like Saudi Arabia, also have compelling reasons to want relief from occupation as well as self-determination
for Palestinians. They may not be concerned to preserve Israel's democracy, as we are, but they share an urgent interest
in ending the radicalization of their own populations, curbing the spread of Islamist terrorism, and eliminating the tensions
with the West that the conflict in the Holy Land fuels. These are the concerns that have driven them to propose peace, as
they very clearly did eight years ago. For related reasons, Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah has made inter-faith dialogue
and the promotion of religious tolerance a main focus of his domestic and international policy.
As the custodian of two of Islam's three sacred places of pilgrimage — Mecca and Medina — Saudi Arabia has long
transcended its own notorious religious narrow-mindedness to hold the holy places in its charge open to Muslims of all
sects and persuasions. This experience, joined with Islamic piety, reinforces a Saudi insistence on the exemption of
religious pilgrimage to Jerusalem from political interference or manipulation. The Ottoman Turks were careful to ensure
freedom of access for worship to adherents of the three Abrahamic faiths when they administered the city. It is an interest
that Jews, Christians, and Muslims share.
There is, in short, far greater congruity between Western and Arab interests affecting the Israel-Palestine dispute than is
generally recognized. This can be the basis for creative diplomacy. The fact that this has not occurred reflects
pathologies of political life in the United States that paralyze the American diplomatic imagination. Tomorrow's meeting
may well demonstrate that, the election of Barack Obama notwithstanding, the United States is still unfit to manage the
achievement of peace between Israel and the Arabs. If so, it is in the American interest as well as everyone else's that
others become the path-breakers, enlisting the United States as best they can in support of what they achieve, but not
expecting America to overcome its incapacity to lead.
Here, I think, there is a lesson to be drawn from the Norwegian experience in the 1990s. The Clinton Administration was
happy to organize the public relations for the Oslo accords but did not take ownership of them. It did little to protect them
from subversion and overthrow, and nothing to insist on their implementation. Only a peace process that is protected
from Israel's ability to manipulate American politics can succeed.
This brings me to how Europeans and Arabs might work together to realize the objectives both share with most
Americans: establishing internationally recognized borders for Israel, securing freedom for the Palestinians, and ending
the stimulus to terrorism in the region and beyond it that strife in the Holy Land entails. I have only four suggestions to
present today. I expect that more ideas will emerge from the discussion period. A serious effort to cooperate with the
Arabs of the sort that Norway is uniquely capable of contriving could lead to the development of still more options for joint
or parallel action on behalf of peace.
Now to my suggestions, presented in ascending order of difficulty, from the least to the most controversial.
First, get behind the Arab peace initiative. Saudi Arab culture frowns on self-promotion and the Kingdom is less gifted
than most at public diplomacy. Political factors inhibit official Arab access to the Israeli press. The Israeli media have
published some — mostly dismissive — commentary on the Arab peace initiative but left most Israelis ignorant of its
contents and unfamiliar with its text. Why not buy space in the Israeli media to give Israelis a chance to read the Arab
League declaration and consider the opportunities it presents? I suspect the Saudis, as well as other members of the
Arab League, would consider it constructive for an outside party to do this. It might facilitate other sorts of cooperation
with them in which European capabilities can also compensate for Arab reticence. The Turks and other non-Arab
Muslims should be brought in as full participants in any such efforts. This wouldn't be bad for Europe's relations with
both. By the way, given the U.S. media's notorious one-sidedness and American ignorance about the Arab peace plan, a
well-targeted advertising campaign in the United States might not be a bad idea either.
Second, help create a Palestinian partner for peace. There can be no peace with Israel unless there are officials who
are empowered by the Palestinian people to negotiate and ratify it. Israel has worked hard to divide the Palestinians so
as to consolidate its conquest of their homeland. Saudi Arabia has several times sought to create a Palestinian peace
partner for Israel by bringing Fatah, Hamas, and other factions together. On each occasion, Israel, with U.S. support, has
acted to preclude this. Active organization of non-American Western support for diplomacy aimed at restoring a unity
government to the Palestinian Authority could make a big difference. The Obama Administration would be under strong
domestic political pressure to join Israel in blocking a joint European-Arab effort to accomplish this. Under some
circumstances, however, it might welcome being put to this test.
Third, reaffirm and enforce international law. The UN Security Council is charged with enforcing the rule of law
internationally. In the case of the Middle East, however, the Council's position at the apex of the international system has
served to erode and subvert the ideal of a rule-bound international order. Almost forty American vetoes have prevented
the application to the Israeli occupying authorities of the Geneva Conventions, the Nuremberg precedents, human rights
conventions, and relevant Security Council directives. American diplomacy on behalf of the Jewish state has silenced the
collective voice of the international community as Israel has illegally colonized and annexed broad swaths of occupied
territory, administered collective punishment to a captive people, assassinated their political leaders, massacred civilians,
barred UN investigators, defied mandatory Security Council resolutions, and otherwise engaged in scofflaw behavior,
usually with only the flimsiest of legally irrelevant excuses.
If ethnic cleansing, settlement activity, and the like are not just ""unhelpful"" but illegal, the international community should
find a way to say so, even if the UN Security Council cannot. Otherwise, the most valuable legacy of Atlantic civilization -
its vision of the rule of law — will be lost. When one side to a dispute is routinely exempted from principles, all exempt
themselves, and the law of the jungle prevails. The international community needs collectively to affirm that Israel, both
as occupier and as regional military hegemon, is legally accountable internationally for its actions. If the UN General
Assembly cannot ""unite for peace"" to do what an incapacitated Security Council cannot, member states should not shrink
from working in conference outside the UN framework. All sides in the murder and mayhem in the Holy Land and beyond
need to understand that they are not above the law. If this message is firmly delivered and enforced, there will be a better
chance for peace.
Fourth, set a deadline linked to an ultimatum. Accept that the United States will frustrate any attempt by the UN
Security Council to address the continuing impasse between Israel and the Palestinians. Organize a global conference
outside the UN system to coordinate a decision to inform the parties to the dispute that if they cannot reach agreement in
a year, one of two solutions will be imposed. Schedule a follow-up conference for a year later. The second conference
would consider whether to recommend universal recognition of a Palestinian state in the area beyond Israel's 1967
borders or recognition of Israel's achievement of de jure as well as de facto sovereignty throughout Palestine (requiring
Israel to grant all governed by it citizenship and equal rights at pain of international sanctions, boycott, and
disinvestment). Either formula would force the parties to make a serious effort to strike a deal or to face the
consequences of their recalcitrance. Either formula could be implemented directly by the states members of the
international community. Admittedly, any serious deadline would provoke a political crisis in Israel and lead to diplomatic
confrontation with the United States as well as Israel, despite the Obama Administration itself having proclaimed a one-
year deadline in order to entice the Palestinians to tomorrow's talks. Yet both Israel and the United States would benefit
immensely from peace with the Palestinians.
Time is running out. The two-state solution may already have been overtaken by Israeli land grabs and settlement
activity. Another cycle of violence is likely in the offing. If so, it will not be local or regional, but global in its reach. Israel's
actions are delegitimizing and isolating it even as they multiply the numbers of those in the region and beyond who are
determined to destroy it. Palestinian suffering is a reproach to all humanity that posturing alone cannot begin to
alleviate. It has become a cancer on the Islamic body politic. It is infecting every extremity of the globe with the rage
against injustice that incites terrorism.
It is time to try new approaches. That is why the question of whether there is a basis for expanded diplomatic cooperation
between Europeans and Arabs is such a timely one. And it is why I was pleased as well as honored to have been asked
to set the stage for a discussion of this issue.","['Middle', 'East', 'Ret', 'Oslo', 'Norway', 'Middle', 'East', 'Gulf', 'Arabs', 'Saudi', 'Arabia', 'Oslo', 'Oslo', 'Oslo', 'East', 'Israel', 'United', 'States', 'Middle', 'East', 'Middle', 'East', 'United', 'States', 'Israel', 'Potomac', 'Norway', 'America', 'Camp', 'David', 'Israel', 'Egypt', 'Israel', 'Oslo', 'United', 'States', 'Middle', 'East', 'Israel', 'United', 'States', 'Israel', 'America', 'Israel', 'West', 'Bank', 'Gaza', 'Palestine', 'Russia', 'America', 'China', 'India', 'Iran', 'Turkey', 'Israel', 'Egypt', 'Jordan', 'Israel', 'U.S.', 'Saudi', 'Arabia', 'Israel', 'America', 'Israel', 'Iran', 'Israel', 'United', 'States', 'United', 'States', 'Washington', 'Washington', 'Afghanistan', 'Iraq', 'America', 'Pakistan', 'Yemen', 'Somalia', 'Israel', 'Iran', 'America', 'United', 'States', 'United', 'States', 'New', 'York', 'Iran', 'Cairo', 'Iraq', 'Afghanistan', 'Iraq', 'Afghanistan', 'Middle', 'East', 'America', 'U.S.', 'Middle', 'East', 'Israel', 'America', 'Israel', 'Middle', 'East', 'Jerusalem', 'Israel', 'Washington', 'Middle', 'East', 'Israel', 'U.S.', 'Oslo', 'Washington', 'Camp', 'David', 'United', 'States', 'Jordan', 'River', 'Palestine', 'Israel', 'United', 'States', 'Gaza', 'Palestine', 'United', 'States', 'America', 'United', 'States', 'Russia', 'Israel', 'Palestine', 'Annapolis', 'Camp', 'David', 'Oslo', 'Washington', 'Egypt', 'Jordan', 'Israel', 'Palestine', 'Washington', 'Saudi', 'Arabia', 'United', 'States', 'Israel', 'Israel', 'United', 'States', 'Israel', 'Israel', 'United', 'States', 'Middle', 'East', 'Israel', 'Israel', 'Israel', 'Israel', 'U.S.', 'Israel', 'Washington', 'Israel', 'Israel', 'Israel', 'Washington', 'Jerusalem', 'Israel', 'Middle', 'East', 'Israel', 'U.S.', 'Middle', 'East', 'Middle', 'East', 'Israel', 'Israel', 'West', 'Saudi', 'Arabia', 'Israel', 'Saudi', 'Arabia', 'Mecca', 'Medina', '—', 'Saudi', 'Arabia', 'Jerusalem', 'United', 'States', 'United', 'States', 'Israel', 'United', 'States', 'America', 'Oslo', 'Israel', 'Israel', 'Norway', 'Kingdom', 'Europe', 'U.S.', 'United', 'States', 'Israel', 'Israel', 'Saudi', 'Arabia', 'Israel', 'Israel', 'U.S.', 'Israel', 'Middle', 'East', 'Nuremberg', 'Israel', 'Atlantic', 'Israel', 'United', 'States', 'Israel', 'Israel', 'Israel', 'Israel', 'Israel', 'United', 'States', 'Israel', 'Israel', 'United', 'States']"

Joint Interview
MS —
Jake just relayed yoLir desire to cancel tomorrow's interview. But I want to make sure you are aware of a few things that
he was not in a position to share:
1) The Israeli & Palestinian interviewers and their teams skipped returning home today with their principals at great
cost and energy in order to stay the extra day to you. One skipped traveling onward with Abbas.
2) Both the Israeli & Palestinian media outlets involved immediately announced their joint interview and are hyping its
unprecedented nature
3) Because of #2, U.S. media is fully aware that this interview is scheduled for tomorrow morning.
So three points:
1) There is an incredibly high expectation for this interview occurring and canceling, no matter the reason cited, will be
taken to mean something negative2) The point of this interview was to shape the narrative coming out of today, and
canceling will only contribute to a negative narrative in that we will be canceling on the most important figure in Israeli
media, and I do not see Channel 2 taking that well3) As positive as the symbolism of this interview was meant to be,
we run the risk of the negative symbolism by canceling.
Typically when you want to cancel something I roll with it. But I want to strenuously object to doing so in this case. I
understand you told the participants they should refrain from public comment, but first, that doesn't mean you have to
and second, you know they won't really refrain. And I am certain they will appreciate the effusive things you have to say
about them during this interview. Not to mention that the reason for canceling is something we ourselves could have
foreseen before going so far down the road, and should have - which I don't think is fair or reflects well on you.
Lastly, on a much more practical note: to get you out of this I am going to have to bribe Channel 2 with a significant and
exclusive interview when we are in Jerusalem in two weeks, and I guarantee you that will be far more painful than
tomorrow's relative short and peaceful format.

Americans Most Likely to Favor GOP
Newcomers for Congress
Three in four believe influx of new members would improve
Congress
by Jeffrey M. Jones
PRINCETON, NJ -- It appears that the best type of candidate to be this fall is a Republican challenger. Given a choice of
four hypothetical candidates of differing party affiliations and experience, Americans are most likely to prefer ""a
Republican who has not served in Congress."" Those who would prefer a Democratic candidate opt for an incumbent over
a newcomer.
These results, based on an Aug. 27-30 USA Today/Gallup poll, underscore the advantageous political environment for
Republicans and non-incumbents this midterm election season. Overall, a majority of Americans prefer a Republican
candidate (regardless of experience) to a Democrat, 53% to 40%. And a majority also prefer a non-incumbent (regardless
of party affiliation) to an incumbent, 54% to 39%.
The fact that Americans who prefer a Republican candidate want one who is new to Congress suggests that these voters
want both GOP control of Congress and the new perspectives that come from members with no prior Washington
experience. Americans who favor Democratic candidates, on the other hand, apparently are more satisfied with the type
of experienced representatives now in Congress.
One would naturally expect Democrats to prefer Democratic candidates, and Republicans to prefer Republican
candidates, and that is the case when looking at the data by party. But partisans' preferences for incumbents versus
challengers seem to be influenced by their knowledge that the Democrats currently have a majority in Congress, and thus,
more Democrats will be defending House seats this fall. Democrats are more likely to prefer a Democrat who is in
Congress to a Democrat who is not, and Republicans are more likely to prefer a Republican outside of Congress to one
who is currently serving there. Independents also show a strong preference for Republican non-incumbents.
The data do not necessarily indicate how Americans would vote in the fall when presented with a choice of two specific
candidates for Congress. This fall, voters will generally be asked to choose between one Republican and one Democratic
candidate, one of whom may be an incumbent. When asked in the same poll whether they are more likely to vote for the
Republican or the Democratic congressional candidate in their district if the elections were held today, 48% of Americans
say the Republican and 43% the Democrat.
The appeal of non-incumbents is apparent in another question in the poll that finds 75% of Americans saying Congress
would be changed for the better if ""most of the present members of Congress are replaced with new members."" Only 14%
think that would make Congress worse. This is consistent with Gallup's findings from earlier this year suggesting strong
anti-incumbent sentiment.
Americans across key demographic subgroups widely share the belief that Congress would be improved if most members
were turned out of office. However, there is a significant gap by political party, with 89% of Republicans versus 63% of
Democrats saying that replacing most members of Congress would be beneficial. Again, the difference likely stems from
Democrats' current status as the majority party in Congress.
Implications
In a year when Americans are dissatisfied with the state of the nation and give relatively low ratings to the president and
Congress, it is not politically beneficial to be either an incumbent or a member of the ruling party. That is reflected in
Americans' preference for a Republican newcomer over other types of candidates they may have a chance to vote for in
this fall's midterm congressional elections. It is also reflected in prior analysis of historical Gallup data showing greater
seat turnover in Congress when the president and Congress are unpopular.","['PRINCETON', 'Washington']"

5985,"For the (FR speech: A New American CenturyI read the Roger Cohen piece and agree that it is v smart. And I've been thinking about the need for a headline/bumper
sticker for the speech. How about ""A New American Century""? We cd take on the critics directly and right up front and
make the argument this way (a lot of this is already in the intro, but wd need to be pulled together differently).
1)We live in a new age of diplomacy - we are seeing the limits of force and we face collective problems that require
bringing together a wider array of key players rather than any one nation dictating a solution. Active diplomacy is the
only option. (This is the argument david rothkopf was making to mark landler when we thought landler was doing a
profile - it resonated v well w/ landler.)
2) The U.S. is uniquely suited to lead in these circumstances. a) In situations where many nations must be brought
together that do not trust each other, we are still seen as the most honest broker. b) In situations where many nations
are sitting around the table contemplating a common problem, someone has to step forward and take responsibility for
mobilizing action (which also includes the risk of failure). We are the nation most willing to do that, both because of our
history and our values. (Here is where S can offer personal anecdotes re nations waiting for us to do something) c) in a
world of global problems, we are the most global nation, with the greatest global reach, resources, and connections.
3) We see global leadership not only as a responsibility but also as an opportunity, b/c of our native confidence,
optimism and faith that problems can be solved. We have a chance to shape a genuinely global agenda, focusing on
development as well as traditional national security issues, and mobilizing business and civil society as well as
governments. This is our time.
The speech would then go on, as it does now, to outline all the ways in which we are building relationships and solving
problems now with traditional allies and new powers on the global landscape while building a longer term architecture
of cooperation that is both truly global and adapted to solving 21st century problems.

job than the Democrats in Congress of handling seven of nine key election issues. The parties are essentially tied on
healthcare, with the environment being the lone Democratic stren th.
The Republicans' advantage on most issues is an indication of the currently favorable political environment for the party.
Of particular note is the parity between the two parties on healthcare, an issue on which Americans historically have
viewed the Democrats as superior.
A similar USA Today/Gallup poll conducted in October 2006, just prior to Democrats' major gains in that fall's elections,
highlights the potential implications of these findings. That poll, which includes several issues measured in the current
survey, found the Democrats leading on all eight issues tested at that time, including some usual Republican strengths
like terrorism and moral values.
With Republicans now having the advantage on most issues, the party may be poised to make major gains in
congressional seats, just as the Democrats did in 2006. Indeed, Gallup tracking of registered voters' preferences in the
2010 generic ballot for Congress continues to find the Republicans ahead of the Democrats, as it has for the past five
weeks.
The Economy Matters Most
The Democrats' advantage on the issue of the environment is likely not something the party can leverage to improve its
2010 electoral fortunes, as Americans rank it at the bottom of the list in terms of its importance to their vote. Rather,
economic concerns are paramount, with a majority of Americans rating the economy, jobs, and federal spending (along
with government corruption) as extremely important.
The Republican advantages on these economic matters range from a low of +5 on jobs to a high of +15 on federal
spending. Terrorism -- the issue on which Republicans have the greatest advantage over Democrats -- is rated as very
important by 47% of Americans, putting it in the middle of the list.
Bottom Line
Republicans' perceptual advantage on most key election issues reinforces the party's advantageous positioning heading
into the stretch run of the 2010 election campaign. It is not clear whether Americans give the Republicans the edge on
these issues because they have confidence in the GOP to make progress in addressing the major problems facing the
country, or whether the ratings have more to do with the public's frustration with the incumbent Democratic Party's
performance to date.
The Democrats' hopes for improving their fortunes may hinge on convincing voters they have superior plans for jump-
starting the economy, the issue of uppermost importance in Americans' minds. That could be tough to do when, after
nearly 20 months of Democratic leadership in Congress and the White House, Americans' opinions of the economy
remain negative and have become more pessimistic in recent weeks.",['PRINCETON']

Politics & Foreign policy
Clinton's aim is true as Democrats' top gun
By Edward Luce in Washington
Published: October 12 2010 20:43 I Last updated: October 12 2010 20:43
Nobody would go so far as to call it a comeback. But Bill Clinton's appearances on the midterm election trail are starting to
turn voters' heads in a way that Barack Obama's simply are not.
Democratic operatives say that Mr Clinton, who went through in 1994 the kind of setback that pollsters say Mr Obama will
face in less than three weeks, is more effective at presenting the election as a choice between starkly different
alternatives rather than a referendum on what people think of the Obama administration.
So far the president, who has booked most of the next three weeks for campaigning, has been unable to pull that off. This
week alone, Mr Clinton has shaken up two Senate races — in Kentucky and West Virginia — with appearances that have
assisted Democratic candidates. Mr Clinton was due to speak in Las Vegas on Tuesday night to assist the embattled
Harry Reid, the Senate majority leader, and then move onto California later in the week.
""Bill Clinton is about as close to a secret weapon as the Democratic party has got,"" says Norm Ornstein, a political analyst
at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. ""He has this ability to fire up the Democratic base that almost nobody
else can do right now."" Mr Clinton's intervention in Kentucky, where Jack Conway, the Democratic candidate, is locked in
a tight race with Rand Paul, the Tea Party icon, is a good case in point.
At the weekend Mr Clinton described Mr Paul, who wants drastically to shrink the size of the US federal government and
has talked of abolishing the Federal Reserve, as a ""radical with no record to back it up"". Mr Paul, who has never run for
elected office, hit back by reminding voters of Mr Clinton's former Monica Lewinsky scandal. ""I am not sure I would trust a
man who had sex with an intern,"" said Mr Paul. ""I mean, do you think he's an honourable person?""
Mr Paul's trip down memory lane appears to have backfired. Few voters seem to care any longer about a scandal that
occurred amid what in retrospect looks like a golden age of balanced budgets, job creation and the absence of foreign
wars.
""Bill Clinton's strength is that he knows how to fight back and turn adversity into advantage,"" says Tad Devine, a veteran
Democratic operative. ""He is also able to enter an individual race, take the temperature, understand what people are
feeling and then base his appeal to voters on that.""
In the West Virginia Senate race, where Joe Manchin, the governor, is trailing John Raese, a wealthy local businessman,
Mr Clinton on Monday came out punching. Referring to Mr Raese's plush Florida vacation home, the former president
said: ""I'm here for a lot of reasons. One is that I don't think it's fair for West Virginia to have one senator and Florida to
have three.""
Acknowledging voter anger in a state where Mr Obama has 29 per cent rating, among the lowest in the country, Mr
Clinton added: 'I am old enough to know that if you make a decision when you are mad — and I am not just talking about
politics here — there is about an 80 per cent chance you will make a mistake.""
In contrast, a lot of Democrats are critical of the way Mr Obama has framed the midterm campaign, shifting from one
attack line to another without sticking to an overarching narrative. Last month, Mr Obama turned on John Boehner, the
Republican congressional leader, in what looked like a move to depict him as the voters' alternative.
More recently, Mr Obama has switched to attacking the Chamber of Commerce for allegedly funnelling foreign money into
attack ads. But it has generated a lot of criticism. ""This election is awash with undisclosed money and it's fair to point out
how disadvantaged the Democrats have been,"" says one consultant. ""But it isn't good politics at this late stage when
voters clearly want to hear about the economy.""

USAID is getting credit for making changes already. This is both the right thing to do and getting good
press where it counts. AM
Dear Friends and Colleagues:
What if we told you a little-known bureaucratic process called ""Implementation and Procurement Reform,""
IPR for short, was one of the biggest victories for poor people in years? It means more aid can go directly
through a country's own systems, making them stronger. It also means that more aid will be administered
by local organizations who know best what their own communities need.
Through IPR, USAID is putting President Obama's recent global development policy into action. The agency
has set clear targets to increase use of local country systems and organizations, which means that US
assistance will help citizens and their governments build their own capacity, instead of setting up a parallel
system as they've done in recent years. They've set clear and ambitious targets for themselves that are
laser-focused on results, and dedicated to fighting global poverty not just in the short term, but for good.
Photo: Local organizations distribute assistance after performing a needs assessment in Bihar, India.
Ian Bray/OXFAM GB
This reform will likely be criticized by some who think that putting more money in the hands of local actors
will expose USAID's programs to more risk. But this is precisely the point; only by supporting local change
agents—both inside and outside developing country governments—can we actually strengthen the hands of
people in poor countries who are working to change their own societies for the better. That means managing
risk wisely, rather than trying to avoid it altogether. And in our field research, 36 of the 39 activists we
interviewed said they want USAID to support their government's directly, because it would make it easier for
them to hold their governments accountable and prevent corruption.
What does all this mean? It means better aid, aid that strengthens the capacity of reformers in poor countries.
And for the millions of people across the world who have been demanding these reforms, USAID has shown
it is actively listening.

The Return of Ghosts: Debating the rise of Geert Wilders and
the far-right at the Nexus Symposium
On 11.18.10, By Max
The Nexus Institute's Return of Ghosts conference was inspired by the rise of far-right politician Geert Wilders in the
Netherlands
I spent last week in Amsterdam, where I participated in the ""Return of Ghosts"" symposium of the Nexus Institute, a
discussion/debate about the resurgence of neo-fascism in Europe and anti-democratic trends in the West. Besides
providing a forum for debating European politics, the symposium was the occasion for the first public appearance in
Europe by Peruvian writer Mario Vargas Llosa since he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature last month. The arrival
of Vargas Llosa, one of the world's foremost intellectuals, resulted in an overflow crowd filled with members of the Dutch
media, the country's political class, and the royal family.
Even with Vargas Llosa in the spotlight, the participants' attention was focused on Geert Wilders, the leader of the far-right
Dutch People's Party for Freedom and Democracy, which is now the third leading party in the Netherlands. With his
gathering influence, Wilders has essentially placed the Dutch coalition government in a stranglehold; the government
meets with him every Wednesday to gauge his opinions and ask for his instructions. While Wilders dictates at will to the
government, he remains independent of it, comfortably avoiding the consequences of policies he has helped to shape. It
is the perfect position for a politician whose agenda is comprised exclusively of xenophobic populism, and typical strategy
of the far-right in countries across the continent.
Wilders' base lies in the mostly Catholic south, where ironically few people have ever encountered a Muslim. He has also
generated support in the city of Groeningen, once a citadel of the communists. Seeking to expand his base, Wilders
promised to hire scores of ""animal cops"" to investigate and prosecute the abuse of animals, a clever wedge strategy in the
only country I know of that has a party dedicated exclusively to animal rights. Of course, Wilders could care less about our
furry friends. His stated goal is to end immigration not just to Holland but to all of Europe; ban the Quran (free speech is
only for the ""Judeo-Christian"" community), and severely limit the rights of Muslim citizens of Europe by, for instance,
instituting what he called a ""head rag tax"" on Muslim women. Wilders' international allies include the goosestepping neo-
Nazis of the English Defense League, the far-right pogromist Pam Geller, the Belgian neo-fascist party Vlaams Belang,
and a substantial portion of the US neocon elite. Over the course of just a few years, he has become perhaps the most
influential Islamophobe in the world.
But does this make Wilders a fascist? Rob Riemen, the director of the Nexus Institute, thinks so. Riemen has just
published a book entitled ""De Eeuwige Terugkeer Van Het Fascisme,"" or ""The Eternal Return of Fascism"" (I eagerly await
its English translation), dedicated to highlighting the danger of Wilders' eerily familiar brand of right-wing populism. In the
book, Riemen urges readers to compare Wilders' politics to the early incarnations of European fascism, not to the
genocidal terminal stage fascism of late World War II. He calls the parallels between Wilders and the early fascists ""one-
and-one."" In an economic and civilizational crisis like the kind the Netherlands is facing, Riemen warns that reactionary
figures like Wilders can easily seize power while centrist elements stand by politely and passively, refusing to call a spade
a spade. Where Wilders' ascendancy will lead is unknown, but if he is not stopped in his tracks, Riemen is certain the
B6
story will not end well. In the week after its publication, Riemen's book flew off the shelves, selling 5000 copies while
generating heated reactions from across the spectrum of debate.
Riemen told me that despite the public enthusiasm for his book, his characterization of Wilders has been attacked as ""un-
Dutch."" In Dutch culture, as in so many others, open confrontation is avoided at all cost. Political disagreement is
welcomed only if it is expressed in a collegial manner, as though nothing more than reputations were at stake. So the
Dutch cultural elite generally goes along to get along. The resistance Riemen has met since he called Wilders out seemed
to have alarmed and frustrated him. Why was it so difficult for liberal elements in the Netherlands to recognize the clear
resonances of fascism in Wilders' political style? he wondered. And why did they seem more concerned with regulating
the terms of debate than with forming a united front against the far-right? Once the symposium opened and I was able to
see the Dutch elite in action, I began to understand Riemen's indignation.
The symposium began with a speech by Vargas Llosa, a complex personality who has allied himself with center-right
parties in Spain and elsewhere but whose politics remain fundamentally rooted in cultural liberalism. Vargas Llosa's
differences with leaders of the left, which he used to belong to, exploded over the issue of free trade. He is an ardent neo-
liberal and reviles Latin populists like Hugo Chavez and 011anta Humala who advocate protectionism and industrial
nationalization.
Vargas Llosa decorated his speech with literary metaphors and natural imagery to describe the challenges of democracy,
particularly in Europe. But the body of the address was devoted to the supposed threat Islamic extremism posed to
Western civilization. Vargas Llosa singled out suicide bombing as the most dangerous phenomenon, pointing to the
Madrid and London bombings by al-Qaida inspired operatives, while curiously not mentioning suicide attacks by secular
groups like the Tamil Tigers and the Kurdish PKK, or the nationalistic suicide terror by Palestinian militants (Vargas Llosa
declared in his speech that ""Israel deserves to be treated like any other nation,"" and has been harshly critical of the state
in the past).
During the first panel, which I participated in, Fania Oz-Salzberger, an Israeli professor of history and the daughter of
famed author Amos Oz, boasted to crowd of Israel's ""vibrant democracy."" She was enthusiastically seconded by Mitchell
Cohen, a former editor of Dissent who has devoted considerable energy to assailing anti-Zionist Jews, writing that ""the
dominant species of anti-Semitism encourages anti-Zionism."" I found it odd that neither expressed any concern over the
almost endless stream of anti-democratic laws passing through the Knesset, or by the general authoritarian, anti-liberal
trend in Israeli society. Oz-Salzberger went on to announce to a smattering of applause that ""Geert Wilders and politicians
like him are not welcomed by Israelis.""
Yet Wilders is one of Israel's most frequent guests, having visited the country over 40 times in 20 years. In fact, he claims
that his views on Islam and Arabs were forged while living on an Israeli moshav. ""Nowhere did I have the special feeling of
solidarity that I get when I land at Ben Gurion airport,"" he once said. Wilders reportedly receives heavy support from Dutch
financial backers of Israel, and has met with a range of Israeli officials. His closest allies lie within the extremist settler
movement, prompting him to call for the forced transfer of Palestinians to Jordan. Members of the liberal Zionist
intelligensia like Oz-Salzberger may not not want Wilders around, but who in Israel is listening to them? Israel's
mainstream leadership echoes Wilders' crudest talking points on a regular basis, while the Zionist left clings to a dwindling
handful of Knesset seats and watches passively — even resentfully — as a rag-tag band of leftist radicals fights for
equality for all. Consider a recent statement by former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, who is seen as a centrist within the
Israeli political spectrum: ""The origin of terrorism is within Islam,"" Olmert declared this month.
The pro-Israel position of the new breed of European far-rightists has to be recognized as much more than a convenient
political tactic. Of course, saying you ""stand with Israel,"" as Wilders so often does, is an easy way to insulate yourself from
charges of anti-Semitism. But the extreme right is also attracted to Israel because the country represents its highest
ideals. While some critics see Israel as a racist apartheid state, people like Wilders see Israel as a racist apartheid state
— and they like it. They richly enjoy when Israel mows down Arab Muslims by the dozens and tells the world to go to hell;
they admire Israel's settler culture; and most of all, they yearn to live in a land like Israel that privileges its ethnic majority
above all others to the point that it systematically humiliates and dispossesses the swarthy racial outclass. The endgame
of the far-right is to make Europe less tolerant and more Israeli.
After the Italian philosopher Paolo Flores D'Arcais proclaimed that Italy was no longer a democratic country, citing PM
Silvio Berlusconi's control over 90 percent of the country's media, the government's deep seated corruption and the Prime
Minister's repeated attempts to impose onerous restrictions on journalistic freedom, Riemen asked me if the United States
was a democracy given the the rapidly rising influence of corporations over the media and elections. After two panelists
had described Israel as a vibrant democracy while another labeled Italy a non-democratic quasi-dictatorship, I decided
that our definition of democracy was subjective at best. So I sidestepped the question and outlined a few of the greatest
blows to American democracy, from the elimination of the Fairness Doctrine to the Telecommunications Deregulation Act
to the Citizens United SCOTUS decision. Later in the evening, D'Arcais would remark to me with amazement that he
never knew American media was ever regulated in the first place.
During the 20 minutes or so when students of Tilburg University were able to question the panel, one student asked
whether suicide terror was a uniquely Islamic phenomenon, apparently referring to Vargas Llosa's address. I responded
that it of course was not, citing the example of secular groups like the Tamil Tigers which brought the tactic into practice
the second suicide. I recommended the audience review the research of Robert Pape, the University of Chicago political
scientist who demonstrated a clear connection between the American and Israeli occupation of Middle Eastern countries
and the motivations of suicide bombers. Oz-Salzberger jumped in, proclaiming that occupation has little or nothing to do
with the motives of suicide bombers. She did not marshal any evidence to support her point, possibly because our time
was so limited. It would have been hard to do so, however, without supporting the fundamental argument of Wilders about
Islam's inherent violence — or the even sillier theory by the Israeli filmmaker/professional hasbarist Pierre Rehov that
suicide bombers are motivated by sexual repression.
Next, the Dutch panel took the stage. The main attraction was Frits Bolkstein, the longtime leader of the People's Party for
Freedom and Democracy who employed Wilders as his parliamentary aide, providing him a stepping stone to his political
career. He was a silver haired curmudgeon from aristocratic stock who reminded me instantly of the ""paleocon"" characters
I've met while covering white nationalist conventions like American Renaissance.
""Everything went wrong when the government became impressed in the 90's with the idea of the 'good stranger,""
Bolkstein declared. ""If the previous governments had tightened their immigration laws, there would not have been a Mr.
Wilders.""
The only member of the panel to mount a significant challenge to Bolkstein was the Tilburg University professor Paul
Frissen, who argued that the rule of law and basic standards of democracy protects ""the right to be fundamentalist."" The
other panelists either gave Bolkstein's xenophobia a pass or attempted to surpass his resentment of Muslims. After
Bolkstein lightly criticized Wilders' call for banning the Quran, remarking that ""what he says about Islam is nonsense""
because it contradicts the freedom of religion, AB Klink, a former Dutch senator and ex-Minister of Health, chimed in.""It's
not nonsense because Islam is so different in its cultural values than ours,"" Klink claimed.
Then, when Bolkstein called for shutting down Islamic schools, Frissen reminded him that state-supported Christian
schools in the Dutch Bible belt teach theocratic concepts as well. Meindert Fennema, the political biographer of Wilders,
entered the debate to demand that all religious schools be closed. ""I'm against all forms of religious teaching!"" he proudly
exclaimed, sending gales of applause through the audience. ""How can you call yourself a liberal?"" Frissen asked with a
tone of exasperation. Fennema ignored him.
During question time, a young freelance writer from India named Natasha Ginwala asked Bolkstein to answer for the
""ghost of neo-colonialism,"" which ""the African people never voted for."" She mentioned the exploitative deals forced on
developing countries by transnational oil companies, possibly alluding to Bolkstein's role as a manager at Royal Dutch
Shell in authoritarian countries like El Salvador, Indonesia, and Honduras during the 1970's (I'm sure nothing unseemly
happened during Bo!stein's tenure in these places). Bolkstein's responded bluntly, ""If these countries try to be self-
sufficient it just doesn't work!""
After the symposium, I talked to Ginwala and a group of her friends, who were mostly immigrant students. They were
appalled by the ignorance of the Dutch panelists. ""None of them knew the first thing about Islam,"" an Arab student
remarked. ""They couldn't even pretend to understand what Muslims actually believe."" Ginwala added, ""How can Bolkstein
tell me my country can't be self-sufficient? I come from India. It's one of the most diversified economies on the planet.""
I was not in Amsterdam long enough to do any formal reporting. However, I did notice that all of the immigrants I spoke to
were closely and nervously following the rise of the right. At the airport, while waiting to board my flight, I talked to a 20-
something security guard named Muhammad who seemed almost as bored as I was. Muhammad had spent his whole life
in Amsterdam, but his parents were from Cairo, Egypt. He told me he wanted to take his girlfriend on a trip to New York
City and Miami someday. When I brought up the topic of Wilders, he scoffed at his perception of Muslims. ""Most of us
aren't even religious,"" Muhammad said. ""When I hear him talking about Muslims wanting to take over, I just laugh. I'm like,
is this guy serious?""
But he did not underestimate Wilders' appeal. ""Everything he does and everything he says, it seems like it's carefully
planned. He obviously knows what he's doing. And they let him get away with it,"" Muhammad remarked. ""Look, I'm just a
citizen, I'm nobody, but if I say something about Christians or Jews that the government doesn't like, I'll be punished. But
when Wilders, who is a public official, says all the things he says about Muslims, nothing happens to him. Instead, more
and more people are voting for him.""","['Amsterdam', 'Netherlands', 'Amsterdam', 'Europe', 'Europe', 'Netherlands', 'Groeningen', 'Holland', 'Europe', 'Europe', 'US', 'Netherlands', 'Netherlands', 'Spain', 'Europe', 'Madrid', 'London', 'Israel', 'Israel', 'Israel', 'Ben', 'Gurion', 'Israel', 'Jordan', 'Israel', 'Israel', 'Israel', 'Israel', 'Israel', 'Israel', 'Israel', 'Israel', 'Europe', 'Italy', 'United', 'States', 'Israel', 'Italy', 'Quran', 'India', 'El', 'Salvador', 'Indonesia', 'Honduras', 'India', 'Amsterdam', 'Amsterdam', 'Cairo', 'Egypt', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Miami']"

Daily Herald Editorial Board
Published: 8/26/2010 12:05 AM
Today marks a watershed moment in our nation's history.
Know what it is? Any plans to celebrate the occasion? Ninety years ago this day, the United States
secretary of state signed into law the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution giving women the right
to vote.
That significant moment in history securing that basic civil right for one of the two genders in
existence came after a more than 70-year struggle that saw pioneering ""radical"" women jailed and
physically abused as they fought for justice.
Ninety years ago today. Not all that long ago, really. We still have women among us who lived during
a time when this basic but powerful activity was prohibited. Denied to their mothers and
grandmothers, older sisters and aunts.
Illinois played a pivotal role in the struggle, and Illinois and suburban women continue to mark our
history, politics and policy. And they should continue to by exercising their right, speaking out and
working to change policies that affect us all.
Illinois did not allow women to vote in presidential and local elections until 1913 and, according to
votingwomen.org, Illinois, Michigan and Wisconsin were the first three states to ratify the 19th
Amendment on June 10, 1919.
From the start, Illinois and its suburbs have been home to pioneering women. Libertyville's Clara
Colby is listed as the first woman to vote, having cast a ballot for a new town hall while, papers at the
time reported, her husband stayed home to ""scrub clothes in the laundry.""
There is Jane Addams, the Cedarville, III., native social worker and suffragist who founded Chicago's
Hull House and was one of the first women to win a Nobel Peace Prize.
And Illinois has elected 14 female members of Congress. The first was Chicago Republican Winnifred
S. Huck, only the third woman elected to Congress, just two years after the 19th Amendment
ratification. Huck was the first wife and mother elected to Congress. Republican Ruth Hanna
McCormick worked as a Springfield lobbyist who helped pass the law allowing Illinois women to vote
in some elections in 1913 before she moved on to Congress. Democrat Emily Taft Douglas, an early
leader of the League of Women Voters and an internationalist who was the wife of former U.S. Sen.
Paul Douglas and a cousin to President William H. Taft, beat isolationist Republican Stephen Day in
1945, according to the Women in Congress website.
In more recent times, Rockford Republican Lynn Martin moved from Congress to Labor Secretary
and Chicago Democrat Carol Moseley Braun became the first black woman in the U.S. Senate. Now,
of course, we also have Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who hails from Park Ridge. In the suburban
trenches all along the way, women have been leading and agitating for change. Former Democratic
state Rep. Eugenia Chapman of Arlington Heights is credited with helping start community colleges in
Illinois. Republican Giddy Dyer of Hinsdale joined her in supporting the Equal Rights Amendment and
also passed DuPage County's first clean air ordinance. Chapman worked with Republican Virginia B.
Macdonald of Arlington Heights to establish a women's center at Harper College. And omit goes.
Nice, you say, but big deal? Indeed, they were a big deal and, indeed, women shaping our lives still
are a big deal. Men, can you imagine your life without women? Women, can you imagine your life
without other women? American women have come a long way in 90 years and society is the better
for it. Women vote in greater numbers than men and have for years, nationally and in Illinois. They
very well can and should vote, write laws, lead and play even more influential roles in what the next
90 years, and beyond, may bring us all.","['United', 'States', 'Illinois', 'Illinois', 'Illinois', 'Illinois', 'Michigan', 'Wisconsin', 'Illinois', 'Libertyville', 'Cedarville', 'Illinois', 'Chicago', 'Springfield', 'Illinois', 'U.S.', 'Rockford', 'Chicago', 'Park', 'Ridge', 'Arlington', 'Heights', 'Illinois', 'Hinsdale', 'DuPage', 'County', 'Arlington', 'Heights', 'Illinois']"

A poisoned process holds little hope
By David Gardner
Published: August 25 2010 22:46 1 Last updated: August 25 2010 22:46
„
As the caravans of Middle East peace negotiators rumble into Washington next week for the umpteenth time, the
pervasive cynicism and sense of deja vu all over again is overwhelming — and with good reason.
The Middle East peace process long ago turned into a tortured charade of pure process while events on the ground — in
particular the relentless and strategic Israeli colonisation of occupied Palestinian land — pull in the opposite direction to
peace. ""We have all been colluding in a gigantic confidence trick,"" is how one Arab minister puts it, ""and here we go
again.""
While many factors had combined to hand veto powers to rejectionists on both sides, the heart of the question remains
the continuing Israeli occupation. It is essential to remember that the biggest single increase of Jewish settlers on Arab
and — a 50 per cent rise — took place in 1992-96 under the governments of peace-makers Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon
Peres at.the high-water mark of the Oslo peace accords. Many Israelis will point to the perfidy of the late Yassir Arafat,
who wanted to talk peace but keep the option of armed resistance dangerously in play. But what killed Oslo was the
occupation. The second intifada that erupted a decade ago was essentially the Oslo war.
A decade on, the Israeli settlement enterprise has turned the occupied West Bank into a discontiguous scattering of
cantons, walled in by a security barrier built on yet more annexed Arab land and criss-crossed by segregated Israeli roads
linking the settlements. Last month, B'Tselem, the Israeli human rights group, published a study showing Israel has now
taken 42 per cent of the West Bank, with 300,000 settlers there and another 200,000 in East Jerusalem. The siege of
Gaza has turned that sliver of land into a vast, open-air prison.
The main feature of the present situationi is the disconnect between the high politics of the utterly discredited peace
process and these — in Israeli parlance — ""facts on the ground"".
At last month's White House summit, where Barack Obama and Benjamin Netanyahu massaged their long estrangement
into a political armistice, the US president praised the Israeli prime minister as a leader ""willing to take risks for peace"".
But there is no evidence for this whatsoever. True, in June last year, in response to Mr Obama's Cairo speech denying
any legitimacy to Israel's settlements, Mr Netanyahu forced himself to utter the words ""Palestinian state"" — but he
surrounded them with barbed-wire caveats that voided them of meaning.
Indeed, the words all sides use — peace, resolution, security, and so on — may be the same; but what each side means by
them is different.
The mainstream Palestinian leaders, President Mahmoud Abbas and Salem Fayyad, the prime minister, and the Quartet
made up of the US, the European Union, the UN and Russia, talk of a negotiated resolution. This means two states living
in peace and security, and a Palestinian homeland on the 22 per cent of Mandate Palestine taken by Israel in the 1967
Arab-Israeli war. East Jerusalem would serve as the capital of the West Bank and Gaza, with marginal land swaps to
preserve some Israeli settlements near Jerusalem. But what does Mr Netanyahu mean?
He has been most clear on what he does not mean. For a start, he has set his face against any concessions on
Jerusalem. He wants to keep most settlements except for the far-flung ""ideological"" ones and the 100-plus ""outposts""
established as pawns to be traded once the chess game began. His idea of a demilitarised Palestinian state is more like a
sort of supra-municipal administration than a self-determined, independent government.
Will he surprise us, on the hackneyed Nixon and China principle that holds it is politicians of the right who most easily
close difficult deals? There is little to suggest that:
The thinking of Mr Netanyahu, son of a celebrated promoter of Greater Israel, has always been profoundly irredentist.
While his nationalist Likud faces the constraints of being in coalition with an assortment of ultra-rightist and ultra-orthodox
parties as well as Labour, that was plainly his choice; the centrist Kadima party was (and remains) an alternative. To be
fair, Israel's electoral system — with a low threshold for entry into the Knesset that makes multi-party coalitions inevitable —
means lobbies such as the settlers can take the national interest hostage. But Mr Netanyahu magnifies this by his choice
of partners and by diligently firing up the ultra-hawks in the pro-Israel lobby in the US.
As risks he. has taken for peace, Exhibit A is the much-hyped moratorium on settlement-building, which expires next
month and has, in any case, been speciously interpreted. While the bulldozers to build settlements have been idling,
moreover, the bulldozers demolishing Palestinian homes have been roaring: the rate of demolition in and around
Jerusalem has doubled this year, while the army has just razed the village of al-Farisiye in the Jordan Valley, in line with
Mr Netanyahu's strategically obsolete obsession with keeping the valley as Israel's eastern border.
As diplomacy struggles to keep alive the viability of a two-state solution, three rival systems of control have crystallised in
the occupied territories that would make up a future Palestinian homeland: the settlements; the crimped Palestinian
Authority of Mr Abbas and Mr Fayyad; and then Hamas, which Israel and its Arab and western allies have tried and failed
to marginalise. Time is short for a negotiated outcome; it may even have run out.
The outlines of a deal are clear, in the (Bill) Clinton parameters of 2000 and Arab Peace initiative of 2002, endorsed by 22
Arab and 57 Muslim countries (as well as Hamas, as part of the 2007 Mecca accord). There has to be an end to the
occupation, and the US and Quartet cannot just allude to this; they must demand it.

Interview / Why Israel should end its policy of
nuclear ambiguity
An interview with Avner Cohen, expert on nonproliferation
issues and author of the forthcoming book ""The Worst-Kept
Secret: Israel's Bargain with the Bomb.""
By Nia.
tasha Mozwvava Tags: Israel news
Avner Cohen is a senior fellow of the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the Monterey Institute of
International Studies. He is the author of ""Israel and the Bomb"" and the forthcoming ""The Worst-Kept Secret: Israel's
Bargain with the Bomb.""
Avner Cohen, you claim that the time has come for Israel to abandon its policy of nuclear ambiguity. Why now,
and why would that be good for Israel?
""Nuclear ambiguity is a cornerstone of Israeli strategic thinking. It was born many years ago, and sealed as part of a
comprehensive deal with the United States in 1969. It was appropriate at the time, but today. in my opinion, it is not just
anachronistic, but foolish and anti-democratic. Even in realpolitik terms, it is an 'own goal' for Israel. In my view, it
undermines genuine Israeli interests, including the need to gain recognition and legitimacy and to be counted among the
responsible states in this strategic field.""
Are you sure the pressure on Israel is so severe? If Israel is criticized over its nuclear program, its usually
marginal. The brunt of the criticism is over its treatment of the Palestinians. •
""Israel received tacit consent for its nuclear program from the Western world because it appeared to be a small, just state'
surrounded by enemies, and the memory of the Holocaust was still fresh. Israel's image was different then.
""In the long term, the more Israel appears to reject peace and to be the one that opposes a two-state solution, the more it
will be perceived as a regional bully that possesses nuclear weapons. So the world will be a lot less forgiving on the
nuclear issue. The situation of ambiguity, in which you don't have real legitimacy, is not a good place to be.""
The United States has called on Israel to join the nonproliferation treaty, but during Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's visit to Washington, U.S. President Barack Obama said he recognizes the special nature of the
threats Israel faces, and these threats warrant special security measures.
The Americans want to appear just and fair because the issue is seen in Israel as completely sacred. They want to look
as though they respect that. This agreement [with the U.S.] has been passed along from president to president, but I don't
believe this issue is as sacred to Americans as it is to Israelis.""
Do you give credence to the slippery slope theory, under which abandoning ambiguity would lead to demands
that Israel disarm?
""Those are cliches used by the defense establishment. Nobody 'demands that Israel make such an announcement without
first doing the preparatory work among its allies and the Arab states. This great fear of a slippery slope is ridiculous. Israel
has its own interests; nobody can coerce it to do things.""
What about the claim that ambiguity is what keeps the Arab states from feeling a need to launch an arms race
against Israel?
""I don't dismiss that claim out of hand, and if, after study and thought, this fear turns out to be warranted, I would be
prepared to wait. But in some ways, ambiguity is insulting to the Arabs. The claim you mention treats Arabs as though
they were children: If they are told that Israel doesn't admit to it, that frees them of the need to deal with the reality. I
believe the Arab countries don't want to play a game of make-believe, but rather want to discuss the topic directly and
realistically.""
You say, basically, that Iran is imitating Israel's nuclear behavior. That comparison would certainly rankle Israel
supporters.
""But the way Iran has advanced toward nuclear capability is not via announcements and tests, but rather by rumors. It can
even remain within the bounds of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. If that rankles anybody, let it rankle.
""If Iran is not attacked, it will want to achieve a status of ambiguity; I see this as nearly certain. The international
community thus has another reason not to accept the idea of ambiguity as legitimate. The norm that a state with a nuclear
weapon must say so clearly is part of the nonproliferation regime. The longer Iran continues down this path, the less
patience the world will have for Israel.""
How do you envision the scenario of 'coming out of the nuclear closet?'
""Censorship plays a very central role in the enforcement of nuclear ambiguity. So long as there is a [military] censor, it is
very hard to alter ambiguity. If censorship didn't exist, israeli newspapers would be able to write about the subject more
openly.
""Another issue is the need for a law that addresses the nuclear topic. There is a Shin Bet [security service] law, but there
is no law for the Mossad and no law for the Israel Atomic Energy Commission. This is a very problematic situation.
""On the international level, it's a sensitive subject that demands preparatory work. Ultimately, I see a political statement by
Israel's government in which the prime minister would find the right way to put this subject on the table. He would talk
about the historical background and the responsible way Israel has dealt with this topic. With a few rare exceptions, these
weapons have no military use; Israel views them as a means of deterrence. I don't think Israel would need to go into detail
regarding how many [bombs] it has or exactly what it has.
""Israel has a right to the bomb no less than New Delhi, or even the United States. Ambiguity creates a sense that we are
sinners, as though we had done something so terrible that we can't tell the awful truth - and I don't think it is so awful. This
is a country that the world has viewed as a nuclear state for a long time, and the time has come for it to say something
positive on this huge, complicated and awe-inspiring topic...
""All these states are ultimately committed under the treaty they signed to achieve a world without nuclear weapons.
Whether that will happen in our lifetimes I can't say.""
You say ambiguity undermines Israeli democracy and prevents debate on matters of life and death, such as the
question of whose finger will be on the button. Do you think the Israeli public is ready for such a discussion?
""There has been very little creative thinking in this area, and ambiguity is one of the stifling factors that have produced an
unacceptable, closed culture incapable of creative thinking. Ambiguity's power derives from the fact that Israeli society
accepts it, and it seems to the public that any attempt to deviate from it would cause serious damage to Israeli security.
""Ambiguity has created a public incapable of dealing with the topic, one that is afraid of it and prefers the issue to be
handled by 'trustworthy hands' so that it does not have to take responsibility itself.
Ambiguity has created an ignorant, craven public.which, in a certain sense, has betrayed its civic, democratic duties on
this subject.""
What's it like researching a topic nobody discusses?
""When I started studying this subject 25 years ago, I had the feeling I was entering a palace where nothing could be
touched. It took me years to find the right way to handle the topic responsibly - from a researcher's perspective, not from
the standpoint of someone who is directly involved in the matter.
Today I think it is possible to initiate a meaningful dialogue about concrete, real issues.""

From Arturo - Correa Rescued in Ecuador
Madame Secretary: After a tense day in which President Correa was slightly injured at noon by rioting and
striking police, and later was barred from leaving the hospital by the same, the army finally rescued him at
9pm last night. Some military units, including the Navy unit in Guayaquil appeared to support the police. The
police also occupied the national congress. As the rescue took place, the head of the Ecuadoran Joints Chiefs
of Staff issued a statement supporting the president, and noting that the armed forces respect the rule of law
""in which the President [Rafael Correa] is the maximum authority of the three branches."" Things are now
calm.
Reaction in the hemisphere was one of deep concern. The OAS adopted a resolution; South American
presidents at the call of UNASUR travelled to Buenos Aires and are likely to go on to Quito to support
Correa. Several, including Garcia and Santos, called Correa. Zapatero also spoke with him. Moratinos tried to
reach you at around 6pm last evening to convey that news, I took the call.
As you know, we issued a statement of support for Correa. I also gave an interview to CNN in Spanish, which
was re-played frequently. I strongly recommend that you call Correa today to reiterate U.S. support for his
government and to wish him well.
He will appreciate it but, more broadly, it sends a signal that the United States supports the constitutional
order and rejects any attempt to undermine it. Chavez in Buenos Aires predictably declared that we were
behind the unrest. We have prepared a call sheet for you.

Europe's New Politics of Fear
by Denis MacShaneApril 16, 2010
There is a new divide in Europe. Not an iron curtain, but an iron intolerance as politicians revert to blaming minorities for
their nations' woes. In Western Europe it is Muslims. In Eastern Europe they are Jews, Roma, and gays. In the
Netherlands, Geert Wilders surged to an election victory in March on the back of anti-Muslim, anti-Quran populism. In
Hungary the Fidesz Party won big in recent elections with attacks on ""Jewish capital... which wants to devour the entire
world."" To the right of Fidesz is the openly anti-Jewish Jobbik Party, which won just two seats fewer than the Socialists. Its
leaders want to wear the neo-Nazi uniform of the pre-1939 Hungarian Guard when they take their seats in Budapest's
Parliament.
Contemporary political scientists do not like to highlight anti-Semitism. They prefer the term ""radical populism,"" but to
anyone with half a sense of European history, the parallels with an older, Jew-baiting politics can no longer be dismissed.
Economic dislocation and a rapid loss of confidence in traditional politics gave rise to ultranationalist movements in the
first half of the last century. Now a global recession and the hunt for someone to blame as jobs and incomes disappear is
producing the same toxic politics.
The Fidesz leader, Viktor Orban, was a youthful evangelist for liberalized open markets after 1990. Now he strikes a much
more nationalist tone. His Socialist opponents had to accept an austerity IMF package. Unlike Greece—which is being
helped, so far, by its euro-zone partners—Hungary was alone as boom-time euro loans to buy houses and cars had to be
paid back in an ever-devaluing forint. Blaming the Socialist government, globalization, and international capital was easy.
But Fidesz went further. In a bid for votes on the far right, a Fidesz parliamentarian, Oszkar Molnar, says it's time to give
""primacy to Hungarian interests over those of global capital, Jewish capital.""
Like Jean-Marie Le Pen's National Front in France, Jobbik has the support of about 15 percent of Hungarian voters. The
Czech right-wing ODS Party has had to dismiss its leader, former premier Mirek Topolanek, after he attacked the Jewish
origins of the current Czech prime minister and castigated the gay transport minister. In a new book, The Populist Radical
Right in Poland, the Oxford-educated Warsaw political professor Rafal Pankowski writes: ""Antisemitism is crucial to the
Polish populist right. The number of Jews in Poland today is minimal, but the anti-Jewish prejudice serves as a code for a
general hostility to diversity and to Polish [liberal] democracy."" For the time being, criticism of nationalist politics is
suspended as Poles mourn President Lech Kaczynski and other national leaders killed in the air-crash tragedy this month.
But the record of his party activists—including Michal Kaminski, Poland's best-known M.E.P. and leader of a small right-
wing group in the Strasbourg Parliament—is disturbing. An admirer of the late Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet,
Kaminski uses ugly language about gays, and says he will apologize for the killing of Jews on Polish soil in World War II
when ""Jews apologize for killing Poles.""
Mainstream political parties have sought to play down the rise of minority bashing. But Fidesz is affiliated with the center-
right European People's Party, which groups Angela Merkel's ruling Christian Democratic Union Party in Germany,
Nicolas Sarkozy's Union for a Popular Movement government in France, and ruling conservative parties in Sweden, Italy,
and Belgium. When Austrian rightist Jorg Haider entered a coalition in Austria a decade ago, the European Union held
Vienna in a political quarantine until Haider was removed. But Fidesz has a massive majority built on attacking ""Jewish
capital"" in language even Haider didn't dare utter.
So radical populism—anti-Muslim in Western Europe, anti-Jewish in Eastern Europe, and anti-foreigner and anti-
immigrant rhetoric everywhere—is no longer fringe politics. In Britain's general election, all the main parties are seeking to
appease anti-foreigner feeling with language on immigrants that they would not tolerate if applied to British citizens living
and working abroad. Comparisons with prewar Europe should not be overdrawn. Fascism is dead and not coming back.
But a new politics of intolerance is afoot in Europe, and no one knows how to deal with it.

What a Tea Party Looks Like in Europe
Marine Le Pen is moving her father's rabble-rousing, far-right
party away from the fringe, and redefining French politics in
the process.
by Tracy McNicoll and Christopher DickeySeptember 05, 2010
amuel Bollendorff / The New York Times-Redux
Marine Le Pen is the heir apparent to the leadership of the National Front, the right-wing party her father Jean-Marie (left)
leads today
Jean-Marie Le Pen, the 82-year-old firebrand of France's far right—the man who for decades has played on the inchoate
fears, xenophobia, knee-jerk racism, and ill-disguised anti-Semitism of many of his supporters—had just finished speaking
to the faithful on a farm not far from the English Channel. As members of the youth wing of his National Front party
feasted on barbecue and apple pie, they were thrilled to see the grand old man hold forth, still the ""provocateur"" taunting
the establishment, the ""toreador"" who hides the sword in his cape and lets the press run at him like a bull. Even these
youngsters knew, however, that Jean-Marie's time in the ring is nearing an end. The old man himself made it clear he's.
determined to step down. All eyes this day were on his daughter Marine. ""She has the will, the courage, the temperament
necessary, and the competence,"" Le Pen told reporters at the farmhouse. ""It seems to me indisputable that she is our
camp's best candidate for 2012.""
Tall, blonde, plain-spoken, and thick-skinned, Le Pen's youngest child, at 42, is the heir apparent to his party. She's
expected to win the contest for its leadership in January, and she's a passionate advocate of its core message: strong
French nationalism, relentless Euro-skepticism, and a lot of hard-nosed talk about fighting crime and immigration. She's a
fresh face, a new look, and, with rising poll numbers placing her third in a crowded field of possible 2012 candidates, a
new threat in French politics. In the eyes of many, she's more effective—and thus more dangerous—than her father.
It's a measure of the Le Pens' enhanced power that they've managed to push President Nicolas Sarkozy to the right and
cast their own party as mainstream. Over the summer, Sarkozy essentially gave up his flirtation with the left, which began
after his election in 2007. He had cherry-picked popular Socialists for his centrist government, dividing their party. But in
elections this past March, Sarkozy's UMP party managed to keep control of only one out of 22 regional governments. So
he decided to swing back to the right by playing on fears about public safety and immigration. He proposed taking
citizenship away from some criminals of immigrant background and launched a campaign against Roma (or ""Gypsies""),
booting hundreds out of the country. While the measures proved popular in opinion polls, Sarkozy, ironically, did not. His
abysmal approval ratings remain in the low 30s.
The younger Le Pen takes great pleasure in watching Sarkozy squirm. ""I think I get on [his] nerves quite a bit,"" she says.
""My profile is much more complicated for him to deal with than that of my father."" The old man could be painted as a
creature of the past, a purveyor of old prejudices with a ""sulfurous"" reputation, says Marine. Today, however, the Front
wants to bill itself as ""neither left nor right."" If that means losing some fringe elements (many of whom support Marine's
rival, Bruno Gollnisch), well, ""tent pis,"" she says.
Other right-wing movements in Europe are also pushing into the political mainstream. The government of Prime Minister
Silvio Berlusconi in Italy has long relied on its alliance with two groups that used to be considered extreme—one of them
the former Fascist Party under Gianfranco Fini, the other the secessionist Northern League of Umberto Bossi. A falling-out
between Berlusconi and Fini has left Bossi as the current kingmaker in Italian politics. In the Netherlands, the militantly
Islamophobic Geert Wilders won enough seats in the last elections to become a pivotal figure in the drawn-out process of
trying to build a new coalition government.
Yet these movements often differ in significant ways from the right wing that's made in the U.S.A. Put aside the usual
caricature of ""people in pointy hoods and the Ku Klux Klan,"" Marine Le Pen says, and she still believes ""the American right
is much more to the right than the National Front."" She might agree with those who want to manage American frontiers
more effectively and prevent massive illegal immigration, but she's also a big believer in the state's ability and obligation
to help its people. ""We feel the state should have the means to intervene,"" she says. ""We are very attached to public
services A la frangaise as a way to limit the inequalities among regions and among the French,"" including ""access for all to
the same level of health care.""
Le Pen grew up in a household that was all politics all the time, with her father the object of sometimes violent attacks by
competing factions on the right, as well as by the left. When Marine was just 8, someone set off a 20-kilo bomb in the
family's Paris apartment building. Miraculously, no one was killed or seriously injured, but the front of the building was
brought down. The crime has never been solved. ""The worst part wasn't just the attack, it was that not a single politician
sent a word of condolence,"" she says. ""It was difficult, but it builds character, it hardens you.""
That's a real asset in political life anywhere. If Sarkozy finds himself facing off against Marine Le Pen in the presidential
race a year and a half from now, he may find himself wishing her old man had stayed around a little longer.

War on terror: Obama softened the language, but
hardened Muslim hearts
The Obama administration's shift in counterterrorism language sought to bridge the divide with the Muslim world and soften Americans' fear of
Islam. But the new rhetoric hasn't matched policy, and the unintended costs at home and abroad have been high.
By Stuart Gottlieb
posted October 14, 2010 at 9:58 am EDT
New Haven, Conn. —
One of the most defining aspects of the Obama administration's counterterrorism strategy has been its effort to change America's rhetorical approach
to the threat of terrorism, particularly Islamic terrorism. ""The language we use matters,"" President Obama told the Arabic satellite television station
Al Arabiya in an interview during his first week in office. Scrubbed were George W. Bush-era terms like ""war on terrorism,"" ""radical Islam,"" and
""jihadist.""The White House's 2010 National Security Strategy formally replaced the term ""Islamic terrorism"" with ""violent extremism.""
The purpose of the shift in semantics was two-fold.
First, it aimed to repackage the fight against terrorism as a specific fight against Al Qaeda, not against Islamic extremism, which Mr. Obama believes
contributed to a post-9/11 perception that America was ""at war with Islam."" Indeed, the new rhetoric has gone hand in hand with Obama's outreach to
the Muslim world to build ""a new partnership based on mutual respect and mutual interest.""
Second, it was part of a broader effort to soften Americans' fear of Islamic terrorism, which Obama officials believe plays directly into the hands of
extremists.
Language change ineffective
Now it is fair to ask whether Obama's use of language regarding terrorism has proven effective. Startling new polls suggest it hasn't. The first, by the
Brookings Institution in Washington, shows that between May 2009 and May 2010 the number of Middle Eastern Arabs expressing optimism in
Obama's approach toward their region dropped from 51 percent to just 16 percent, with those describing themselves as ""discouraged"" by the Obama
presidency rising from 15 percent to 63 percent.
The second, by the Pew Research Center, shows that in August 2010 fewer Americans held a favorable view of Islam (30 percent) than five years
earlier during the Bush administration (41 percent), with more Americans (35 percent) saying Islam encourages violence more than other religions
(in 2002, it was 25 percent).
These starkly negative trend lines suggest the limited utility of language in fighting terrorism. Yes, terrorism is a propaganda-fueled activity – an
ongoing battle to win hearts and minds and attract new recruits to fight for the cause. And of course the language used in combating terrorism is vital
– the counterproductive ""smoke 'em out"" rhetoric of the Bush administration is a case in point.
But if rhetoric does not match policy, or appears to discount or play down threats, the credibility – and thus effectiveness – of the overall
counterterrorism strategy may be undermined. It appears the Obama administration has dug itself into just such a hole.
Rhetoric doesn't match policy
When looking beyond the nuanced language and appealing promises, what Muslims around the world see is an administration that has ramped up the
war in Afghanistan; is killing scores of Muslim civilians with drone strikes; continues to hold more than 1,000 Muslim detainees in Guantanamo,
Bagram, and other prisons; and maintains seemingly unconditional support of Israel.
This is not to critique these policies, but to point out that they do not match the raised expectations of the Muslim world and have only muddled
Obama's oft-stated goal of turning Muslims toward America and away from extremist movements.
The price of downplaying the threat
A large price is also being paid domestically for disconnected rhetoric. Despite maintaining nearly all of Bush's hard-line tactics — the USA Patriot
Act, warrantless surveillance, indefinite detentions the White House has consistently played down the threat, even in the face of a clear uptick in
terrorism activity.
For example, following the failed 2009 Christmas Day airline bombing, Obama described the suspect as an ""isolated extremist,"" despite his ties to Al
Qaeda. And the administration's initial response to the failed May 2010 Times Square bombing by an American Muslim trained in Pakistan was to
call it a ""one-off' event. Attorney General Eric Holder stated in congressional testimony that he believed these and other recent Islamic terror plots
were unconnected, and unrelated to radical Islam.
There is little doubt that the administration's unwillingness to speak candidly about Islamic terrorism has taken a toll on the public's trust. A Gallup
poll released last month shows Americans favoring Republicans over Democrats on the issue of terrorism 55 percent to 31 percent — up from 49
percent to 42 percent last fall.
Time to reverse the trend
Obama entered office promising to fight a smarter and more effective war on terrorism, and in many ways he has. His instincts to maintain aggressive
tactics while toning down inflammatory rhetoric were sound. Yet his administration seems to have overlearned a key lesson of the Bush years — that
overstating the threat of terrorism has costs attached. So, too, does rhetoric that understates the threat, especially when detached from policy.
It is not too late to reverse this troubling trend. The White House can begin by focusing less on overly reassuring rhetoric — which has not paid
dividends at home or abroad — and more on a candid accounting of the threats faced and the policies employed to confront them.

November 22, 2010 - American Voters Could Deny Obama Reelection, Quinnipiac University National
Poll Finds; President Tied With Romney, Huckabee But Leads Palin
Word format
President Barack Obama does not deserve a second term, American voters say 49 - 43 percent, and he is in a
statistical dead heat with possible Republican challengers Mitt Romney and Mike Huckabee, according to a
Quinnipiac University poll released today. President Obama leads Sarah Palin 48 - 40 percent.
Romney, Huckabee, Palin and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich are bunched together when Republican
voters are asked who they prefer for the GOP's 2012 presidential nomination, the independent Quinnipiac
(KWIN-uh-pe-ack) University survey finds.
Democratic voters say 64 - 27 percent they do not want anyone to challenge President Obama for their party's
nomination in 2012.
""The Democratic base remains squarely behind President Barack Obama when it comes to his re-election, but
his weakness among independent voters at this point makes his 2012 election prospects uncertain,"" said Peter
A. Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute.
""The demographic splits in the electorate when voters are asked whether the president deserves a second term is
a roadmap for his re-election strategists on how they need to focus their appeal. Only 39 percent of men, 34
percent of whites, 35 percent of political independents and 38 percent of those over age 35 think he deserves
four more years in the Oval Office.""
In trial heats for 2012, former Massachusetts Gov. Romney receives 45 percent to 44 percent for Obama, while
the president gets 46 percent to 44 percent for Mr. Huckabee. Matched against Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels, a
virtual unknown to most voters, the president leads 45 - 36 percent.
""At this point, former Alaska Gov. Palin runs the worst against President Obama. Daniels is essentially a
generic Republican because of his anonymity to most voters. Obama only gets 45 percent against him while he
gets 48 percent against Ms. Palin,"" said Brown. ""She is very unpopular among independents and although she
recently said she thought she could defeat Obama, the data does not now necessarily support that assertion.""
""Unlike Daniels, who is a political unknown to most Americans, virtually all voters have formed an opinion
about Palin and that opinion is not encouraging for her candidacy.""
Ms. Palin is viewed the most negatively by the American people of the possible Republican candidates in 2012.
She is viewed unfavorable by 51 percent of voters and favorably by 36 percent. Among independents, the key
swing voting bloc, she has a negative 54 - 33 percent favorability rating.
Huckabee gets a 41 - 25 percent favorability rating and Romney gets a 38 - 26 percent score. Former U.S.
House Speaker Newt Gingrich gets a negative 30 - 43 percent score.
Obama gets a 48 - 48 percent split overall, with a negative 43 - 52 percent among independent voters.
In a mythical Republican primary Ms. Palin gets 19 percent, including 25 percent of GOP women, followed by
Romney with 18 percent, Huckabee at 17 percent, Gingrich at 15 percent, Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty at 6
percent and Daniels, Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour and Sen. John Thune of South Dakota at 2 percent each.
""The best thing Obama has going for him when it comes to his re-election may be that at this point the
Republicans don't have a candidate who is both nationally well-known and well- liked by a majority of voters,""
said Brown.
From November 8 - 15, Quinnipiac University surveyed 2,424 registered voters nationwide, live by telephone,
with a margin of error of +/- 2 percentage points.
The Quinnipiac University Poll, directed by Douglas Schwartz, Ph.D., conducts public opinion surveys in

""Palestinian-Israeli Direct Talks: The Case for a Regional Approach""By Marwan Muasher (Carnegie Endowment Bulletin,
August 2010)
Marwan Muasher – former Jordanian foreign minister, ambassador, and deputy prime minister – advocates a regional
settlement to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, capitalizing on the 2002 Arab Peace Initiative. His approach depends first
on securing end-game ""deposits"" from all parties: The parties would offer hypothetical commitments that they might
not be willing to give at the onset, but that can be ""deposited"" with the U.S. and committed to only if the other side is
willing to do the same. Saudi Arabia's deposit, for instance, would outline and agree to a package that included details
about Jerusalem. The Saudi package would also promise to secure Arab and Muslim backing for the painful compromises
the Palestinians would need to accept.
Muasher advocates a similar approach to the Syrian track—asking Syria to deposit end-game commitments in return for
full Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights. In their deposits, the Saudis and the Syrians must clearly commit to
address the inclusion of Hamas and Hezbollah in any regional agreement. The Arab states would not only have to end all
logistical, financial, and military support for these two groups, but they would have to assume responsibility for
delivering these two actors, helping to transform them into political players. Israel's deposit would spell out its
commitment to a solution based on 1967 borders and a return of the Golan.
According to Muasher, these deposits would make it much easier for President Abbas to engage in talks aimed at ending
the conflict. After he has been given Arab cover, Abbas could provide his own end-game deposits. According to
Muasher, absent these commitments from the Arab states, the Palestinian positions will remain maximalist. Once the
U.S. has deposits from all sides that make for a reasonable, comprehensive package, it should put this package on the
table in cooperation with the Quartet. Once the comprehensive package is presented, the U.S. can focus on confidence-
building measures to move all sides toward the end game.

Effort for Liberal Balance to G.O.P. Groups
Begins
By MICHAEL LUO
In what may prove a significant development for the 2012 elections, David Brock, a prominent Democratic political
operative, says he has amassed $4 million in pledges over the last few weeks and is moving quickly to hire a staff to set
up what he hopes will become a permanent liberal counterweight over the airwaves to the Republican-leaning outside
groups that spent so heavily on this year's midterm elections.
Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, a former Maryland lieutenant governor and the eldest of Robert F. Kennedy's 11 children,
has agreed to serve as the chairwoman of the group, which will be called American Bridge, lending to the still extremely
nascent undertaking the weight of what remains one of the most significant families in Democratic politics.
Leading Democratic donors who have already pledged money to the group include Rob McKay, heir to the Taco Bell
fortune and chairman of the Democracy Alliance, a partnership of wealthy liberal donors; Robert Dyson, who heads
Dyson-Kissner-Moran, a takeover and acquisitions firm in New York City; and Marcia L. Carsey, a television producer who
gave $1 million to Democratic outside groups in 2004.
Mr. Brock said in an interview that he planned to formally file papers with the Federal Election Commission on Tuesday to
set up American Bridge as what is known as an independent-expenditure-only political action committee, meaning it will
be able to take in contributions of unlimited size from individuals and corporations but must regularly disclose its donors.
Certain to set off debate, however, is that Mr. Brock appears to be positioning his new organization so that fund-raising
consultants can raise money for Democratic-oriented media efforts not just through American Bridge but also via one of
the nonprofit organizations Mr. Brock currently runs, Media Matters Action Network, which does not disclose its donors.
The action network, which tracks conservative politicians and advocacy organizations, is organized as a 501(c)(4)
nonprofit group and is set to take on an expanded role in the 2012 elections, including potentially running television ads,
according to an internal draft concept paper about American Bridge's and Media Matter Action Network's plans obtained
by The New York Times.
Mr. Brock said that ""money is money,"" and that he would actively solicit donors for both entities and, in the end, the media
spending would be apportioned accordingly.
The moves by Mr. Brock in recent weeks make his the most concrete effort so far on the part of Democratic activists to
establish some kind of centralized structure that they hope will become the left's answer in 2012 to such groups on the
right as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, American Crossroads and others, which significantly outspent Democratic-
leaning outside groups this year. It is too early to say whether Mr. Brock's group will emerge as the go-to vehicle for giant
contributions on the left.
Mr. Brock led a much-heralded independent group in the 2008 presidential election that failed to gain much traction after
the Obama campaign indicated that it preferred that donors not give to such groups.
But Mr. Brock, a former conservative journalist who publicly disavowed the right in the late 1990s, is a respected political
player, who has drawn plaudits from liberal donors for his running of the array of groups under the Media Matters
umbrella.
Mr. Brock pointed out that the various groups associated with Media Matters had raised a combined $23 million this year.
Its backers include major Democratic donors like George Soros, the billionaire who recently announced he had given $1
million to the group; Peter B. Lewis, the billionaire chairman of Progressive Insurance, who, like Mr. Soros, gave more
than $20 million to Democratic-oriented groups in 2004; and the Hollywood producer Steve Bing.
""My donor base already constitutes the major individual players who have historically given hundreds of millions of dollars
to these types of efforts,"" Mr. Brock said. ""They just need to be asked, and I have no doubt they will step up at this critical
time.""
There also seems to be widespread agreement among Democratic activists and donors on the need for such groups to be
more heavily involved in the 2012 elections.
White House officials have signaled in recent weeks that the Obama administration would not object to Democratic-
leaning outside groups getting involved in the 2012 elections, a change from the Obama campaign's attitude toward such
groups in 2008. But they have also indicated that they would prefer that the names of donors be disclosed.
The lack of disclosure among Republican-leaning outside groups became a central Democratic talking point this year as
spending by outside groups on the right exploded before the midterm elections.
But the overriding desire on the part of liberal donors and activists to hold on to the White House and to win back some of
what was lost in the House and Senate may trump those principles. Most political operatives agree that it is easier to raise
money if the option of offering anonymity is available.
""It would be sort of a funny principle to stand on, to essentially tie one hand behind your back,"" Mr. McKay said.
Besides Mr. Brock, numerous Democratic activists have been in discussions about setting up similar independent efforts.
On Monday, for instance, Steve Rosenthal, who was the chief executive of America Coming Together, a Democratic fund-
raising vehicle that focused on voter mobilization in the 2004 election, convened a group of political operatives, many of
whom were active in that election, at a Washington restaurant to discuss what might be done for 2012.
No one, however, has apparently gone as far as Mr. Brock in terms of raising money and formally setting up an
organization.
Mr. Brock said the $4 million in pledges the group has collected so far should be deposited in its bank account by the end
of the first quarter of 2011.
By way of comparison, America's Families First Action Fund, one of the major Democratic independent efforts in House
races this year, raised just over $4 million for the entire cycle up until mid-October.
The internal concept paper for American Bridge lays out a series of priorities for the next year, including initially focusing
on attacking vulnerable Republicans in the Senate and the House, as a prelude to major spending in 2012.","['Maryland', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'American', 'Bridge', 'American', 'Bridge', 'Hollywood', 'Washington', 'America']"

US Election And The Fed
Welcome To The New (Old) World
September 19, 2010
One of the main debates inside senior Fed offices is how much they may have to balance a much more
conservative fiscal policy if the Republicans take over. This is the most important question facing officials
on both sides of the fence (far more than squiggles and whirls of monthly numbers).
But it's not just spending and taxes, important as they are, it's also implementation of Reg Reform and
Health Care Reform. All of that is going to change after November. Here are the details.
Amid the snarkiness about how crazy the Tea Party candidates may be (and, as you know, we LOVE
snarkiness) two things should not be lost:
1. The President has lost control of the spending and tax agenda
2. The President has lost control of implementing the Reg Reform and health care
legislation Congress pushed through.
All polling from both parties and independent sources point strongly to the Republicans taking over the
House. Although they are less likely to take over the Senate, they will be able to gain effective control of
spending, taxes and large scale administrative reforms.
Let's start with spending:
The basic fact is that all spending has to be approved by Congress and it starts with the House. As we
wrote nearly a week ago, House Republican Leader Boehner and his senior staff have made it clear to us
that they would like to freeze spending at 2008 levels with an annual cost savings of $340 billion. This will
be one of the top Republican priorities.
Freezing spending at 2008 levels will not happen. However, even in the unlikely event the Republicans do
not take over the House the budget will -- at most -- be frozen at or near FY 2010 levels (i.e. the last time
money was formally appropriated).
Since there have been no spending bills approved and the fiscal year starts in October, the Congress has
to pass a ""continuing resolution"" that keeps the government running until specific appropriations are made
(the 1995 government shutdown happened because there were no appropriations and no continuing
resolution...the government literally runs out of spending authority).
Congress will pass a CR in the next few weeks and it will most likely run through the formation of the new
Congress (say February or March) next year. They could only do it through the lame duck session, but
that would be cutting it close and too cute.
Because the new Congress - even if the Republicans fail to take full control of the House - will be
dominated by fiscal conservatives, Boehner's CR idea will have traction. The Senate will make it more
moderate, but then it will be up to the President to veto it and thus shut down government or sign it and
take the hit.
In turn that does two things: (1) it frees up money for the Bush tax rollovers and (2) it helps the plan to
slow or freeze implementation of the reg reform and health care reform bills.
The first part is obvious. The second may be less so. People forget that implementation of these rules
requires staff increases, staff reg writing, etc and that's money. By freezing spending at previous levels
you freeze the ability to hire new staff and you seriously obstruct the new rule writing process.
Add to that Boehner's commitment to overturn the two major regulatory reforms and you've got a tidal
wave of indecision and paralysis (Jesus, talk about mixed metaphors although it would be interesting to
see one of those).
The hearings he will announce and simply the chilling effect of him threatening to overturn the laws will
accomplish ninety-percent of what he wants to get done, and potentially give the courts time to strike
down parts of the health care bill now under appeal.
THE SENATE
While everyone has written off Republican control of the Senate (we haven't), the attention should be on
what the Senate will look like even if the consensus of 52-54 Democratic majority prevails.
The point is how the US Senate will function in January 2011 given its new membership. We got a
glimpse of what this would look like when moderate Republican Scott Brown was elected and the health
care public option was panned and Reg Reform was trimmed around the edges.
The incoming crop of members are much more ardent on government spending, the debt, taxes and

Take a quick look at the new members (and the several they will marry up with once they are sworn into
office).
While some of these candidates are replacing Republican open seats, all of them are generally considered
more conservative than their predecessors:
1. ck (CO) - likely winner
2. Toomey (PA) - likely winner
3. Rubio (FL) - likely winner
4. Ayotte (NH) - likely winner
5. Blunt (MO) - likely winner
6. Portman (OH) -likely winner
7. Coats (IN) - likely winner
8. Paul (KY) - likely winner
9. Miller (AK) - likely winner
10. Lee (UT) - likely winner
11. Boozman (AR) - likely winner
12. Hoeven (ND) - likely winner
13. Kirk (IL) - 50/50 (lean GOP)
14. Angle (NV) - 50/50 tossup
There are several other Democrat-controlled seats that remain in play (CA, WI, WA, and CT). These races
continue to develop and we will report more as the picture on Election Day becomes clearer.
These likely new members will join the following traditional budget trouble-makers in the US Senate:
1. DeMint (SC)
2. Coburn (OK)
3. Inhofe (OK)
4. McConnell (KY)
5. Kyl (AZ)
6. McCain (AZ)
7. Thune (SD)
8. Crapo (ID)
9. Vitter (LA)
10. Burr (NC)
One aggressive Senator can slow the body to a snail's pace, and Republicans operated efficiently as a
minority party with only 41 votes total. In January, there will be at least 22 new and existing serious road
blocks now patrolling the Senate Floor. The Republican pick-ups will make getting to 60 votes for cloture
impossible on spending bills.

Declaring America's Stand on Middle East Peace
By Chester A. Crocker, Scott B. Lasensky and Samuel W. Lewis
Faltering Middle East peace talks need a jolt. Washington has a powerful option for moving the process forward: taking
a firm stand on how to end the conflict.
An American declaration of principles—carefully crafted and properly marketed--could spark a debate and thereby
change the political calculus for leaders. As a mediator and a world power, one of America's strongest assets is the
ability to legitimize ideas and then rally others in support. A central role for the U.S. in this conflict must be to define the
zone of negotiability.
This does not mean imposing peace. Rather, it would be a statement of the basic principles the U.S. believes can guide
the parties toward a negotiated solution. America has long declared its support for ""two states,"" but must now say more
about what that means in practice.
Even if the current talks resume, without American ideas the parties are unlikely to agree on the broad trade-offs
necessary to reach a peace deal. A quick deal on ""borders and security,"" as many have proposed, is itself unlikely
without Washington addressing the end-game. Otherwise, both sides would be too exposed on issues set for later
discussion, like Jerusalem and refugees. Opinion polling has consistently showed that support for peace is strongest
when all the core issues are addressed.
An American statement of principles would mobilize regional support. It would provide, for the first time, a public
framework for engaging sponsors of the Arab Peace Initiative. It would also strengthen our ability to reassert the
importance of a regional support structure for the bilateral negotiations, especially by reviving multilateral contacts and
meetings involving Israelis and their neighbors from throughout the region. Moreover, greater regional engagement on
the peace process can carry powerful benefits for regional challenges like the Iranian nuclear program.
A clearer U.S. declaration is also the surest way to protect prospects for a two-state solution from an unrelenting
onslaught on the ground that pushes the parties away from a peace deal. An American set of ideas would anchor
present-day demands on issues like Jerusalem, security and settlements in a clear vision of the future.
Perhaps most urgently, it would broaden the debate from the narrow confines of the settlements question.
At a minimum, the American declaration should be based on the 1967 lines, with agreed territorial swaps; support a
compromise on Jerusalem that allows for two capitals for two states; include provisions about security limitations and
guarantees; reiterate America's support for an agreed solution to the refugee problem; and reaffirm our long-standing
commitment to the State of Israel. But American principles should also include some caveat, given that our ultimate
interest is in an agreed, viable solution—not in any particular formula.
What would it take for American ideas to succeed? Unlike some past efforts, Washington should not try to 'pre-cook'
this declaration with one or more parties or to choreograph their reactions. In fact, the U.S. statement of principles
would be explicitly described as what our own country believes in and can support; and by implication cannot support.
Thus, the U.S. statement would not be designed to achieve immediate approval or adoption by the parties. Its purpose
would be to clarify where America stands, how we define our interests and what we can work for. It would aim at
influencing the climate of thinking in the region, sobering up those with illusions and encouraging those who need our
support.
Timing and context are of course key considerations. Assuming the current gridlock in negotiations persists, some time
must elapse until our election results have been digested, here and abroad, and before public attention can be
redirected toward the foreboding and increasingly dangerous Arab-Israel stalemate.
A presidential speech will then be essential to dramatize the seriousness of our purpose and to lay out the principles. It
should be immediately followed by a major, high level diplomatic effort to persuade key Middle East leaders and our
Quartet and UN allies of our genuine desire to regionalize the peacemaking effort. To maximize support from key
members of Congress, the speech should occur before Congress adjourns. No further consultation with the stalemated
parties beyond the routine should precede the speech, and leaks of its contents must be kept to an absolute minimum if
our purpose is not to be undermined.
The speech could usefully also remove some of the veil of silence that shrouds breakthroughs in past negotiations; for
example, progress in the Annapolis process.
As for the substance, in its endorsement of a two-state solution and comprehensive Arab-Israeli peace, the Obama
Administration has hinted that a Palestinian settlement should also accompany normalized relations between Israel and
the Arab states, putting a broader framing around what has traditionally been defined as a conflict between Israel and
its immediate neighbors. The normalization piece of the puzzle should be more fully articulated as part of a new strategy
based on presenting American ideas to the parties. It is a way to entice skeptical Israelis, but it also leads back to a long
overdue need for Washington to engage on the Arab Peace Initiative.
If the U.S. puts forward its own peace principles, American leadership can ensure that any diplomatic process is defined
by as clear a picture as possible of what the parties can expect to gain through a negotiated settlement, and of what
they will never gain without one.
Skeptics say it is too risky to present American ideas to the parties, that it would pull the rug out from under current
leaders, exposing them to withering domestic criticism. Others argue that it will galvanize obstructionists, not those who
support compromise, and could very well precipitate a crisis on the ground. Others simply worry about the cost to
American prestige should any of the key players react negatively. But the risks are overstated, and a complete collapse
of the process would be far more dangerous, particularly as the strategic environment shifts in favor of regional forces
that seek to undermine, rather than promote peace.
America can and must do more than limit itself to managing a conflict that has all too often upended our shared
interests in peace and stability.

A shoot out occurred on August 20 in front of the American School in Monterrey (AFSM), resulting in the death of two

attempted kidnapping targeting the relatives of a local business executive. While it does not appear that U.S. families
were targeted, the sharp increase in kidnapping incidents in the Monterrey area, and this event in particular, present a
very high risk to the families of U.S. citizens who might be become incidental victims.
U.S. security and law enforcement personnel have engaged local and federal security officials to seek their help on
understanding the immediate risks and measures that can be taken. I have urged U.S. families at the Consulate in
Monterrey not to send their children to school in the coming days while we review the events that took place on August
20. We also are advising U.S. citizens in the area that we have urged Consulate personnel not to send their children to
school while we complete this security review.
I am sure that the warden notice will lead to a rash of press reports on U.S. concerns about security in Monterrey. More
broadly, if the government cannot get the kidnappings in Monterrey under control, that may affect our ability to
function in Monterrey. I have advised Secretary Espinosa of this, and have sought her help as well to address consulate
security.

A REPORTER AT 1.ARGE
COVERT OPERATIONS
The billionaire brothers who are waging a war against Obama.
by Jane Mayetmo,
(.s..
David H. Koch in 1996. He and his brother Charles are lifelong libertarians and have quietly given more than a hundred million
dollars to right-wing causes.
On May 17th, a black-tie audience at the Metropolitan Opera House applauded as a tall, jovial-looking billionaire tOok the
stage. It was the seventieth annual spring gala of American Ballet Theatre, and David H. Koch was being celebrated for his
generosity as a member of the board of trustees; he had recently donated $2.5 million toward the company's upcoming season,
and had given many millions before that. Koch received an award while flanked by two of the gala's co-chairs, Blaine Trump,
in a peach-colored gown, and Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg, in emerald green. Kennedy's mother, Jacqueline Kennedy
Onassis, had been a patron of the ballet and, coincidentally, the previous owner of a Fifth Avenue apartment that Koch had
bought, in 1995, and then sold, eleven years later, for thirty-two million dollars, having found it too small.
The gala marked the social ascent of Koch, who, at the age of seventy, has become one of the city's most prominent
philanthropists. In 2008, he donated a hundred million dollars to modernize. Lincoln Center's New York State Theatre building,
which now bears his name. He has given twenty million to the American Museum of Natural History, whose dinosaur wing is
named for him. This spring, after noticing the decrepit state of the fountains outside the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Koch
pledged at least ten million dollars for their renovation. He is a trustee of the museum, perhaps the most coveted social prize in
the city, and serves on the board of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, where, after he donated more than forty million
dollars, an endowed chair and a research center were named for him.
One dignitary was conspicuously absent from the gala: the event's third honorary co-chair, Michelle Obama. Her office
said that a scheduling conflict had prevented her from attending. Yet had the First Lady shared the stage with Koch it might
have created an awkward tableau. In Washington, Koch is best known as part of a family that has repeatedly funded stealth
attacks on the federal government, and on the Obama Administration in particular.
With his brother Charles, who is seventy-four, David Koch owns virtually all of Koch Industries, a conglomerate,
headquartered in Wichita. Kansas, whose annual revenues are estimated to be a hundred billion dollars. The company has
grown spectacularly since their father, Fred, died, in 1967, and the brothers took charge. The Kochs operate oil refineries in
Alaska, Texas, and Minnesota, and control some four thousand miles of pipeline. Koch Industries owns Brawny paper towels,
Dixie. cups, Georgia-Pacific lumber, Staimnaster carpet, and Lycra, among other products. Forbes ranks it as the second-largest
private company in the country, after Cargill, and its consistent profitability has made David and Charles Koch—who, years
ago, bought out two other brothers—among the richest Men in America. Their combined fortune of thirty-five billion dollars is
exceeded only by those of Bill Gates and Warren Buffett.
The Kochs are longtime libertarians who believe in drastically lower personal and corporate taxes, minimal social services
for the needy, and much less oversight of industry—especially environmental regulation. These views dovetail with the
brothers' corporate interests. In a study released this spring, the University of Massachusetts at Amherst's Political Economy
Research Institute named Koch Industries one of the top ten air polluters in the United States.- And Greenpeace issued a report
identifying the company as a ""kingpin of climate science denial."" The report showed that, from 2005 to 2008, the Kochs vastly
outdid ExxonMobil in giving money to organizations fighting legislation related to climate change, unclerwriting'a huge
network of foundations, think tanks, and political front groups. Indeed, the brothers have funded opposition campaigns against
so many Obama Administration policies—from health-care reform to the economic-stimulus program----that, in political circles,
their ideological network is known as the Kochtopus.
In a statement, Koch Industries said that the Greenpeace report ""distorts the environmental record of our companies."" And. .
David Koch, in a recent, admiring article about him in New York, protested that the ""radical press"" had turned his family into
""whipping boys,"" and had exaggerated its influence on American politics. But Charles Lewis, the founder of the Center for
Public Integrity, a nonpartisan watchdog group, said, ""The Kochs are on a whole different level. There's no one else who has
spent this much money. The sheer dimension of it is what sets them apart. They have a pattern of lawbreaking, political
manipulation, and obfuscation. I've been in Washington since Watergate, and I've never seen anything like it. They are the
Standard Oil of our times.""
few weeks after the Lincoln Center gala, the advocacy wing of the Americans for Prosperity Foundation—an organization that
David Koch started, in 2004—held a different kind of gathering. Over the July 4th weekend, a summit called Texas Defending
the American Dream took place in a chilly hotel ballroom in Austin. Though Koch freely promotes his philanthropic ventures,
lie did not attend the summit, and his name was not in evidence. And on this occasion the audience was roused not by a,dance
performance but by a series of speakers denouncing President Barack Obama. Peggy Venable, the organizer of the summit,
warned that Administration officials ""have a socialist visiOn for this country.""
Five hundred people attended the summit, which served, in part, as a training session for Tea Party activists in Texas. An
advertisement cast the event as a populist uprising against vested corporate power. ""Today, the voices of average Americans are
being drowned out by lobbyists and special interests,"" it said. ""But you can do something about it."" The pitch made no mention
of its corporate funders. The White House has expressed frustration that such sponsors have largely eluded public notice. David .
Axelrod, Obama's senior adviser, said, ""What they don't say is that, in part, this is a grassroots citizens' movement brought to
you by a bunch of oil billionaires.""
In April, 2009, Melissa Cohlmia, a company spokesperson; denied that the Kochs had direct links to the Tea Party, saying
that Americans for Prosperity is ""an independent organization and Koch companies do not in any way direct their activities.""
.Later, she issued a statement: ""No funding has been provided by Koch companies, the Koch foundations, or Charles Koch or
David Koch specifically to support the tea parties."" David Koch told New York, ""I've never been to a tea-party event. No one
representing the tea party has ever even approached me.""
At the lectern in Austin, however, Venable—a longtime political operative who draws a salary from Americans for
Prosperity, and who has worked for Koch-funded political groups since 1994—spoke less warily: ""We love what the Tea
Parties are doing, because that's how we're going to take back America!"" she declared, as the crowd cheered. In a subsequent
interview, she described herself as an early member of the movement, joking, ""I was part of the Tea Party before it was cool!""
She explained that the role of Americans for Prosperity was to help ""educate"" Tea Party activists on policy details, and to give
them ""next-step training"" after their rallies, so that their political energy could be channelled ""more effectively."" And she noted
that Americans for Prosperity had provided Tea Party activists with lists of elected officials to target. She said of the Kochs.
""They're certainly our people. David's the chairman of our board. I've certainly met with them, and I'm very appreciative Of
what they do.""
Venable honored several Tea Party ""citizen leaders"" at the summit. The Texas branch of Americans for Prosperity gave its
Blogger of the Year Award to a young woman named Sibyl West. On June 14th, West, writing on her site, described Obama as
the ""cokehead in chief."" In an online thread, West speculated that the President was exhibiting symptoms of ""demonic
possession (aka schizophrenia, etc.)."" The summit featured several paid speakers, including Janine Turner, the actress best
known for her role on the television series ""Northern Exposure."" She declared, ""They don't want our children to know about
their rights. They don't want our children to know about a God!""
During a catered lunch, Venable introduced Ted Cruz, a former solicitor general of Texas, who told the crowd that Obama
was ""the most radical President ever to occupy the Oval Office,"" and had hidden from voters a secret agenda—""the government
taking over our economy and our lives."" Countering Obama, Cruz proclaimed, was the epic fight of our generation!"" As the
crowd rose to its feet and cheered, he quoted the defiant words of a Texan at the Alamo: ""Victory, or death!""
Americans for Prosperity has worked closely with the Tea Party since the movement's inception. In the weeks before the
first Tax Day protests, in April, 2009, Americans for Prosperity hosted a Web site offering supporters ""Tea Party Talking
Points."" The Arizona branch urged people to send tea bags to Obama; the Missouri branch urged members to sign up for
""Taxpayer Tea Party Registration"" and provided directions to nine protests. The group continues to stoke the rebellion. The
North Carolina branch recently launched a ""Tea Party Finder"" Web site, advertised as ""a hub for all the Tea Parties in North
Carolina.""
The anti-government fervor infusing the 2010 elections represents a political triumph for the Kochs. By giving money to
""educate,"" fund, and organize Tea Party protesters, they have helped turn their private agenda into a mass movement. Bruce
Bartlett, a conservative economist and a historian, who once worked at the National Center for Policy Analysis, a Dallas-based
think tank that the Kochs fund, said, ""The problem with the whole libertarian movement is that it's been all chiefs and no
Indians. There haven't been any actual people, like voters, who give a crap about it. So the problem for the Kochs has been
trying to create a movement."" With the emergence of the Tea Party, he said, ""everyone suddenly sees that for the first time there
are Indians out there—people who can provide real ideological power."" The Kochs, he said, are ""trying to shape and control and
channel the populist uprising into their own policies.""-
A Republican campaign consultant who has done research on behalf of Charles and David Koch said of the Tea Party, ""The
Koch brothers gave the money that founded it. It's like they put the seeds in the ground. Then the rainstorm comes, and the
frogs come out of the mud—and they're our candidates!""
The Kochs and their political operatives declined requests for interviews. Instead, a prominent New York public-relations
executive who is close with the Kochs put forward two friends: George Pataki, the former governor of New York, and Mortimer
Zuckerman, the publisher and real-estate magnate. Pataki, a Republican who received campaign donations from David Koch,
called him ""a patriot who cares deeply about his country."" Zuckerman praised David's ""gentle decency"" and the ""range of his
public interests.""
The Republican campaign consultant said of the family's political activities, ""To call them under the radar is an
understatement. They are underground!"" Another former Koch adviser said, ""They're smart. This right-wing, redneck stuff
works for them. They see this as a way to get things done without getting dirty themselves."" Rob Stein, a Democratic political
strategist who has studied the conservative movement's finances, said that the Kochs are ""at the epicenter of the anti-Obama
movement. But it's not just about Obama. They would have done the same to Hillary Clinton. They did the same with Bill •
Clinton. They are out to destroy progressivism.""
ddly enough, the fiercely capitalist Koch family owes part of its fortune to Joseph Stalin. Fred Koch was the son of a Dutch
printer who settled in Texas and ran a weekly newspaper. Fred attended M.I.T., where he earned a degree in chemical
engineering. In 1927, he invented a more efficient process for converting oil into gasoline; but, according to family lore,
America's major oil companies regarded him as a threat and shut him out of the industry. Unable to succeed at home, Koch
found work in the Soviet Union. In the nineteen-thirties, his company trained Bolshevik engineers and helped Stalin's regime
set up fifteen modern oil refineries. Over time, however, Stalin brutally purged several of Koch's Soviet colleagues. Koch was
deeply affected by the experience, and regretted his collaboration. He returned to the U.S. In the headquarters of his company,
Rock Island Oil & Refining, in Wichita, he kept photographs aimed at proving that some of those Soviet refineries had been
destroyed in the Second World War. Gus diZerega, a former friend of Charles Koch, recalled, ""As the Soviets became a
stronger military power, Fred felt a certain amount of guilt at having helped build them up. I think it bothered him a lot.""
In 1958, Fred Koch became one of the original members of the john Birch Society, the arch-conservative group known, in
part, for a highly skeptical view of governance and for spreading fears of a Communist takeover. Members considered President
Dwight D. Eisenhower to be a Communist agent. In a self-published broadside, Koch claimed that the Communists have
infiltrated both the Democrat and Republican Parties."" He wrote admiringly of Benito Mussolini's suppression of Communists
in Italy, and disparagingly of the American civil-rights movement. ""The colored man looms large in the Communist plan to take
over America,"" he warned. Welfare was a secret plot to attract rural blacks to cities, where they would foment ""a vicious race
war."" In a 1963 speech that prefigures the Tea Party's talk of a secret 'socialist plot, Koch predicted that Communists would
""infiltrate the highest offices of government in the U.S. until the President is a Communist, unknown to the rest of us.""
Koch married Mary Robinson, the daughter of a Missouri physician, and they had four sons: Freddie, Charles, and twins,
David and William. John Damgard, the president of the Futures Industry Association, was David's schoolmate and friend. He
recalled that Fred Koch was ""a real John Wayne type."" Koch emphasized rugged pursuits, taking his sons big-game hunting in
Africa, and requiring them to do farm labor at the family ranch. The Kochs lived in a stone mansion on a large compound across
from Wichita's country club; in the summer, the boys could hear their friends splashing in the pool, but they were not allowed
to join them. ""By instilling a work ethie in me at an early age, my father did me a big favor, although it didn't seem like a favor
back then,"" Charles has written. ""By the time I was eight, he made sure work occupied most of my spare time."" David Koch
recalled that his father also indoctrinated the boys politically. ""He was constantly speaking to us children about what was wrong
with government,"" he told Brian Doherty, an editor of the libertarian magazine Reason, and the author of ""Radicals for
Capitalism,"" a 2007 history of the libertarian movement. ""It's something I grew up with—a fundamental point of view that big
government was bad, and imposition of government controls on our lives and economic fortunes was not good.""
David attended Deerfield Academy, in Massachusetts, and Charles was sent to military school. Charles, David, and William
all earned engineering degrees at their father's alma mater, M.I.T., and later joined the family company. Charles eventually
assumed control, with David as his deputy; William's career at the company was less successful. Freddie went to Harvard and
studied playwriting at the Yale School of Drama. His father reportedly disapproved of him, and punished him financially.
(Freddie, through a spokesperson, denied this:)
In 1967, after Fred Koch died, of a heart attack, Charles renamed the business Koch Industries, in honor of his father. Fred
Koch's will made his sons extraordinarily wealthy. David Koch joked about his good fortune in a 2003 speech to alumni at
Deerfield, where, after pledging twenty-five million dollars, he was made the school's sole ""lifetime trustee."" He said, ""You
might ask: How does David Koch happen to have the wealth to be so generous? Well, let me tell you a story. It all started when
I was alittle boy. One day, my father gave me an apple. I soon sold it for five dollars and bought two apples and sold them for
ten. Then I bought four apples and sold them for twenty. Well, this went on day after day, week after week, month after month,
year after year, until my father died and left me three hundred million dollars!""
David and Charles had absorbed their father's conservative politics, but they did not share all his views, according to
diZerega, who befriended Charles in the mid-sixties, after meeting him while browsing in a John Birch Society bookstore in
Wichita. Charles eventually invited him to the Kochs' mansion, to participate in an informal political-discussion group. ""It was
pretty clear that Charles thought some of the Birch Society was bullshit,"" diZerega recalled.
DiZerega, who has lost touch with Charles, eventually abandOned right-wing views, and became a political-science
professor. He credits Charles with opening his mind to political philosophy, which set him on the path to academia; Charles is
one of three people to whom he dedicated his first book. But diZerega believes that the Koch brothers have followed a wayward
intellectual trajectory, transferring their father's paranoia about Soviet Communism to a distrust of the U.S. government, and
seeing its expansion, beginning with the New Deal, as a tyrannical threat to freedom. In an essay, posted on Beliefnet, diZerega
writes, ""As state socialism failed ... the target for many within these organizations shifted to any kind of regulation at all.
'Socialism' kept. being defined downwards.""
Members of the. John Birch Society developed.an interest in a school of Austrian economists who promoted free-market
ideals. Charles and David Koch were particularly influenced by the work of Friedrich von Hayek, the author of ""The Road to
Serfdom"" (1944), which argued that centralized government planning led, inexorably, to totalitarianism. Hayek'S belief in
unfettered capitalism has proved inspirational to many conservatives, and to anti-Soviet dissidents; lately, Tea Party supporters
have championed his work. In June, the talk-radio host Glenn Beck, who has supported the Tea Party rebellion, promoted ""The
Road to Serfdom"" on his show; the paperback soon became a No. 1 best-seller on Amazon. (Beck appears to be a fan of the
Kochs; in the midst of arecent on-air parody of Al Gore, Beck said, without explanation, ""I want to thank Charles Koch for this
information."" Beck declined to elaborate on the relationship.)
Charles and David also became devotees of a more radical thinker, Robert LeFevre, who favored the abolition of the state
but didn't like the label ""anarchist""; he called himself an ""autarchist."" LeFevre liked to say that ""government is a disease
masquerading as its own cure."" In 1956, he opened an institution called the Freedom School, in Colorado Springs. Brian
Doherty, of Reason, told me that ""LeFevre was an anarchist figure who won Charles's heart,"" and that the school was ""a tiny
world of people who thought the New Deal was a horrible mistake."" According to diZerega, Charles supported the school
financially, and even gave him money to take classes there.
Throughout the seventies, Charles and David continued to build Koch Industries. In 1980, William, with assistance from
Freddie, attempted to take over the company from Charles, who, they felt, had assumed autocratic control. In retaliation, the
company's board, which answered to Charles, fired William. (""Charles runs it all with an iron hand,"" Bruce Bartlett, the
economist, told me.) Lawsuits were filed, with William and Freddie on one side and Charles and David on the other. In 1983,
Charles and David bought out their brothers' share in the company for nearly a billion dollars. But the antagonism remained,
and litigation continued for seventeen more years, with the brothers hiring rival private investigators; in 1990, they walked past
one another with stony expressions at their mother's funeral. Eventually. Freddie moved to Monaco, which has no income tax.
He bought historic, estates in France. Austria, and elsewhere, filling them with art, antiques, opera scores, and literary
manuscripts. William founded his own energy company, Oxbow, and turned to yachting; he spent an estimated sixty-five
million dollars to win the America's Cup, in 1992.
With Charles as the undisputed chairman and C.E.O., Koch Industries expanded rapidly. Roger Altman, who heads the
investment-banking firm Evercore, told me that the company's performance has been ""beyond phenomenal."" Charles remained
in Wichita, with his wife and two children, guarding his privacy while supporting community charities. David moved to New
York City, where he is an executive vice-president of the company and the C.E.O. of its Chemical Technology Group. A
financial expert who knows Koch Industries well told me, ""Charles is the company. Charles runs it."" David, described by
associates as ""affable"" and ""a bit of a lunk,"" enjoyed for years the life of a wealthy bachelor. He rented a yacht in the South of
France and bought a waterfront home in Southampton, where he threw parties that the Web site New York Social Diary likened
to an ""East Coast version of Hugh Hefher's soirees."" In 1996, he married Julia Flesher, a fashion assistant. They live in a nine-
thousand-square-foot duplex at 740 Park Avenue, with their three children. Though David's manner is more cosmopolitan, and
more genial, than that of Charles, Brian Doherty, who has interviewed both brothers, couldn't think of a single issue on which
the brothers disagreed.
As their fortunes grew, Charles and David Koch became the primary underwriters of hard-line libertarian politics in
America. Charles's goal, as Doherty described it, was to tear the government ""out at the root."" The brothers' first major public
step came in 1979, when Charles persuaded David, then thirty-nine, to run for public office. They had become supporters of the
Libertarian Party, and were backing its Presidential candidate, Ed Clark, who was running against Ronald Reagan from the
right. Frustrated by the legal limits on campaign donations, they contrived to place David on the ticket, in the Vice-Presidential
slot; upon becoming a candidate, he could lavish as much of his personal fortune as he wished on the campaign. The ticket's
slogan was ""The Libertarian Party has only one source of funds: You."" In fact, its primary source of funds was David Koch,
who spent more than two million dollars on the effort.
Many of the ideas propounded in the 1980 campaign presaged the Tea Party movement. Ed Clark told The Nation that
libertarians were getting ready to stage ""a very big tea party,"" because people were ""sick to death"" of taxes. The Libertarian
Party platform called for the abolition of the F.B.I. and the C.I.A., as well as of federal regulatory agencies, such as the
Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Energy. The Party wanted to end Social Security, minimum-wage
laws, gun control, and all personal and corporate income taxes; it proposed the legalization of prostitution, recreational drugs,
and suicide. Government should be reduced to only one function: the protection of individual rights. William F. Buckley, Jr., a
more traditional conservative, called the movement ""Anarcho-Totalitarianism.""
That November, the Libertarian ticket received only one per cent of the vote. The brothers realized that their brand of
politics didn't sell at the ballot box. Charles Koch became openly scornful of conventional politics. ""It tends to be a nasty,
corrupting business,"" he told a reporter at the time. ""I'm interested in advancing libertarian ideas."" According to Doherty's
book, the .Kochs came to regard elected politicians as merely ""actors playing out a script."" A longtime confidant of the Kochs
told Doherty that the brothers wanted to ""supply the themes and words for the scripts."" In order to alter the direction of
America, they had to ""influence the areas where policy ideas percolate from: academia. and think tanks.""
fter the 1980 election, Charles and David Koch receded from the public arena. But they poured more than a hundred million
. dollars into dozens of seemingly independent organizations. Tax records indicate that in 2008 the three main Koch family
foundations gave money.to thirty-four political and policy organizations, three of which they founded, and several of which
they direct. The Kochs and their company have given additional millions to political campaigns, advocacy groups, and
lobbyists. The family's subterranean financial role has fuelled suspicion on the left: Lee Fang, of the liberal blog ThinkProgress,
has called the Kochs the billionaires behind the hate.""
Only the Kochs know precisely how much they have spent on politics. Public tax records show that between 1998 and 2008
the Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation spent more than forty-eight million dollars. The Claude R. Lambe Charitable
Foundation, which is controlled by Charles Koch and his wife, along with two company employees and an accountant, spent
more than twenty-eight million. The David H. Koch Charitable Foundation spent more than a hundred and twenty million.
Meanwhile, since 1998 Koch Industries has spent more than fifty million dollars on lobbying. Separately, the company's
political-action committee, KochPAC, has donated some eight million dollars to political campaigns, more than eighty
per cent of it to Republicans. So far in 2010, Koch Industries leads all other energy companies in political
contributions, as it has since 2006. In addition, during the past dozen years the Kochs and other family members
have personally spent more than two million dollars on political contributions. In the second quarter of 2010, David
Koch was the biggest individual contributor to the Republican Governors Association, with a million-dollar donation.
Other gifts by the Kochs may be untraceable; federal tax law permits anonymous personal donations to politically
active nonprofit groups.
In recent decades, members of several industrial dynasties have spent parts of their fortunes on a conservative agenda. In
the nineteen-eighties, the Olin family, which owns a chemicals-and-manufacturing conglomerate, became known for funding
right-leaning thinking in academia, particularly in law schools. And during the nineties Richard Mellon Scaife, a descendant of
Andrew Mellon, spent millions attempting to discredit President Bill Clinton. An Rabin-Havt, a vice-president at the
Democratic-leaning Web site Media Matters, said that the Kochs' effort is Unusual, in its marshalling of corporate and personal
funds: ""Their role, in terms of financial commitments, is staggering.""
Of course, Democrats give money, too. Their most prominent donor, the financier George Soros, runs a foundation, the
Open Society Institute, that has spent as much as a hundred million dollars a year in America. Soros has also made generous
private contributions to various Democratic campaigns, including Obama's. But Michael Vachon, his spokesman, argued that
Soros's giving is transparent, and that ""none of his contributions are in the service of his own economic interests."" The Kochs
have given millions of dollars to nonprofit groups that criticize environmental regulation and support lower taxes for industry.
Gus diZerega, the former friend, suggested that the Kochs' youthful idealism about libertarianism had largely devolved into a
rationale for corporate self-interest. He said of Charles, ""Perhaps he has confused making money with freedom.""
Some critics have suggested that the Kochs' approach has subverted the purpose of tax-exempt giving. By law, charitable
foundations must conduct exclusively nonpartisan activities that promote the public welfare. A 2004 report by the National
Committee for Responsive Philanthropy, a watchdog group, described the Kochs' foundations as being self-serving,
concluding, ""These foundations give money to nonprofit organizations that do research and advocacy on issues that impact the
profit margin of Koch Industries.""
The Kochs have gone well beyond their immediate self-interest, however, funding organizations that aim to push the
country in a libertarian. direction. Among the institutions that they have subsidized are the Institute for Justice, which files.
lawsuits opposing state and federal regulations; the Institute for Humane Studies, which underwrites libertarian academics; and
the Bill of Rights Institute, which promotes a conservative slant on the Constitution. Many of the organizations funded by the
Kochs employ specialists who write position Papers that are subsequently quoted by politicians and pundits. David Koch has
acknowledged that the family exerts tight ideological control. ""If we're going to give a lot of money, we'll make darn sure they •
spend it in a way that goes along with our intent,"" he told Doherty. ""And if they make a wrong turn and start doing things we
don't agree with, we withdraw funding.""
he Kochs' subsidization of a pro-corporate movement fulfills, in many ways, the vision laid out in a secret 1971 memo that
Lewis Powell. then a Virginia attorney, wrote two months before he was nominated to the Supreme Court. The antiwar
movement had turned its anger on defense contractors, such as Dow Chemical, and Ralph Nader was leading a public-interest
crusade against corporations. Powell, writing a report for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, urged American companies to fight
back. The greatest threat to free enterprise, he warned, was not Communism or the New Left but, rather, ""respectable elements
of society""—intellectuals, journalists, and scientists. To defeat them, he wrote, business leaders needed to wage a long-term,
• unified campaign to change public opinion.
Charles Koch seems to have approached both business and politics with the deliberation of an engineer. ""To bring about
social change,"" he told Doherty, requires ""a strategy"" that is ""vertically and horizontally integrated,"" spanning ""from idea
creation to policy development to education to grassroots organizations to lobbying to litigation to political action."" The project,
he admitted, was extremely ambitious. ""We have a radical philosophy,"" he said.
In 1977, the Kochs provided the funds to launch the nation's first libertarian think tank, the Cato Institute. According to the
'Center for Public Integrity, between 1986 and 1993 the Koch family gave eleven million dollars to the institute. Today Cato
has more than a hundred full-time employees, and its experts and policy papers are widely quoted and respected by the
mainstream media. It describes itself as nonpartisan, and its scholars have at times been critical of both parties. But it has
consistently pushed for corporate tax cuts, reductions in social services, and laissez-faire environmental policies.
When President Obama, in a 2008 speech, described the science on global warming as ""beyond dispute,"" the Cato Institute
took out a full-page ad in the Times to contradict him. Cato's resident scholars have relentlessly criticized political attempts to
stop global warming as expensive, ineffective, and unnecessary. Ed Crane, the Cato Institute's founder and president, told me
that ""global-warming theories give the government more control of the economy.""
Cato scholars have been particularly energetic in promoting the Climategate scandal. Last year, private e-mails of climate
scientists at the University of East Anglia, in England, were mysteriously leaked, and their exchanges appeared to suggest a
willingness to falsify data in order to buttress the idea that global warming is real. In the two weeks after the e-mails went
public, one Cato scholar gave more than twenty media interviews trumpeting the alleged scandal. But five independent inquiries
have since exonerated the researchers, and nothing was found in their e-mails or data to discredit the scientific consensus on
global warming. •
Nevertheless, the controversy succeeded in spreading skepticism about climate change. Even though the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration recently issued a report concluding that the evidence for global warming is unequivocal, more
Americans are convinced than at any time since 1997 that scientists have exaggerated the seriousness of global warming. The
Kochs promote this statistic on their company's Web site but do not mention the role that their funding has played in fostering
such doubt.
In a 2002 memo, the Republican political consultant Frank Luntz wrote that so long as ""voters believe there is no consensus
about global warming within the scientific community' the status quo would prevail. The key for opponents of environmental
reform, he said, was to question the science—a public-relations strategy that the tobacco industry used effectively for years to
forestall regulation. The Kochs have funded many sources of environmental skepticism, such as the Heritage Foundation, which
has argued that ""scientific facts gathered in the past 10 years do not support the notion of catastrophic human-made warming.""
The brothers have given money to more obscure groups, too, such as the Independent Women's Forum, which opposes the
presentation of global warming as a scientific fact in American public schools. Until 2008, the group was run by Nancy
Pfotenhauer, a former lobbyist for Koch Industries. Mary Beth Jarvis, a vice-president of a Koch subsidiary, is on the group's
board.
Naomi Oreskes, a professor of history and science studies at the University of California, San Diego, is the co-author of
""Merchants of Doubt,"" a new book that chronicles various attempts by American industry to manipulate public opinion on
science. She noted that the Kochs, as the heads of ""a company with refineries and pipelines,"" have ""a lot at stake."" She added,
""If the answer is to phase out fossil fuels, a different group of people are going to be making money, so we shouldn't be
surprised that they're fighting tooth and nail.""
David Koch told New York that he was unconvinced that global warming has been caused by human activity. Even if it has
been, he said, the heating of the planet will be beneficial, resulting in longer growing seasons in the Northern Hemisphere. ""The
Earth will be able to support enormously more people because far greater land area will be available to produce food,"" he said.
n the mid-eighties, the Kochs provided millions of dollars to George Mason University, in Arlington, Virginia, to set up another
think tank. Now known as the Mercatus Center, it promotes itself as ""the world's premier university source for market-oriented
ideas—bridging the gap between academic ideas and real-world problems."" Financial records show that the Koch family
foundations have contributed more than thirty million dollar's to George Mason, much of which has gone to the Mercatus
Center, a nonprofit organization. ""It's ground zero for deregulation policy in Washington,"" Rob Stein, the Democratic strategist,
said. It is an unusual arrangement. ""George Mason is a public university, and receives public funds,"" Stein noted. ""Virginia is
hosting an institution that the Kochs practically control.""
The founder of the Mercatus Center is Richard Fink, formerly an economist. Fink heads Koch Industries' lobbying
operation in Washington. In addition, he is the president of the Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation, the president of the
Claude R. Lambe Charitable Foundation, a director of the Fred C. and Mary R. Koch Foundation, and a director and co-
founder, with David Koch, of the Americans for Prosperity Foundation.
Fink, with his many titles, has become the central nervous system of the Kochtopus. He appears to have supplanted Ed
Crane, the head of the Cato Institute, as the brothers' main political lieutenant. Though David remains on the board at Cato,
Charles Koch has fallen out with Crane. Associates suggested to me that Crane had been insufficiently respectful of Charles's
management philosophy, which he distilled into a book called ""The Science of Success,"" and trademarked under the name
Market-Based Management, or M.B.M. In the book. Charles recommends instilling a company's corporate culture with the
competitiveness of the marketplace.. Koch describes M.B.M. as a ""holistic system"" containing ""five dimensions: vision, virtue
and talents, knowledge processes, decision rights and incentives."" A top Cato Institute official told me that Charles ""thinks he's
a genius. He's the emperor, and he's convinced he's wearing clothes."" Fink, by contrast, has been far more embracing of
Charles's ideas. (Fink, like the Kochs, declined to. be interviewed.)
At a 1995 conference for philanthropfsts, Fink adopted the language of economics when speaking about the Mercatus
Center's purpose. He said that grant-makers should use think tanks and political-action groups to convert intellectual raw
materials into policy ""products.""
The Wall Street Journal has called the Mercatus Center ""the most important think tank you've never heard of,"" and noted
that fourteen of the twenty-three regulations that President George W. Bush placed on a ""hit list"" had been suggested first by
Mercatus scholars. Fink told the paper that the Kochs have ""other means of fighting [their] battles,"" and that the Mercatus
Center does riot actively promote the company's private interests. But Thomas McGarity, a law professor at the University of
Texas, who specializes in environmental issues, told me that ""Koch has been constantly in trouble with the E.P.A., and
Mercatus has constantly hammered on the agency."" An environmental lawyer who has clashed with the Mercatus Center called
it ""a means of laundering economic aims."" The lawyer explained the strategy: ""You take corporate money and give it to a
neutral-sounding think tank,"" which ""hires people with pedigrees and academic degrees who put out credible-seeming studies.
But they all coincide perfectly with the economic interests of their funders.""
In 1997, for instance, the E.P.A. moved to reduce surface ozone, a form of pollution caused, in part, by emissions from oil
refineries. Susan Dudley, an economist who became a top official at the 'Mercatus Center, criticized the proposed rule. The
E.P.A., she argued, had not taken into account that smog-free skies would result in more cases of skin cancer. She projected that
if pollution were controlled it would cause up to eleven thousand additional cases of skin cancer each year.
In 1999, the District of Columbia Circuit Court took 'up Dudley's smog argument. Evaluating the E.P.A. rule, the court
found that the E.P.A. had ""explicitly disregarded"" the ""possible health benefits of ozone."" In another part of the opinion, the
court ruled, 2-1, that the E.P.A. had overstepped its authority in calibrating standards for ozone emissions. As the Constitutional
Accountability Center, a think tank, revealed, the judges in the majority had previously attended legal junkets, on a Montana
ranch, that were arranged by the Foundation for Research on Economics and the Environment—a group funded by Koch family
foundations. The judges have claimed that the ruling was unaffected by their attendance.
deas don't happen on their own,"" Matt Kibbe, the president of Freedom Works, a Tea Party advocacy group, told me.
""Throughout history, ideas need patrons."" The Koch brothers, after helping to create Cato and Mercatus, concluded that think
tanks alone were not enough to effect change. They needed a mechanism to deliver those ideas to the street, and to attract the
public's support. in 1984, David Koch and Richard Fink created yet another organization. and Kibbe joined them. The group,
Citizens for a Sound Economy, seemed like a grassroots movement, but according to the Center for Public Integrity it was
sponsored principally by the Kochs, who provided $7.9 million between 1986 and 19.93. Its mission, Kibbe said, ""was to take
these heavy ideas and translate them for mass America.... We read the same literature Obama did about nonviolent
revolutions--Saul _Minsky, Gandhi, Martin Luther King. We studied the idea of the Boston Tea Party as an example of
nonviolent social change. We learned we needed boots on the ground to sell ideas, not candidates."" Within a few years, the
group had mobilized fifty paid field workers, in twenty-six states, to rally voters behind the Kochs' agenda. David and Charles,
according to one participant, were ""very controlling, very top down. You can't build an organization with them. They run it.""
Around this time, the brothers faced a political crisis. In 1989, the Senate Select Committee on Indian Affairs investigated
their business and released a scathing report accusing Koch Oil of ""a widespread and sophisticated scheme to steal crude oil
from Indians and others through fraudulent mismeasuring."" The Kochs admitted that they had improperly taken thirty-one
million dollars' worth of crude oil, but said that it had been accidental. Charles Koch told committee investigators that oil
measurement is ""a very uncertain art.""
To defend its reputation, Koch IndustrieS hired Robert Strauss, then a premier Washington lobbyist; the company soon
opened an office in the city. A grand jury was convened to investigate the allegations, but it eventually disbanded, without
issuing criminal charges. According to the Senate report, after the committee hearings Koch operatives delved into the personal
lives of committee staffers, even questioning an ex-wife. Senate investigators were upset by the Kochs' tactics. Kenneth Batten,
the counsel to the Senate committee, said, ""These people have amassed such unaccountable power!'
.'
By •1993, when Bill Clinton became President, Citizens for a Sound Economy had become a prototype for the kind of
corporate-backed opposition campaigns that have proliferated during the Obama era. The group waged a successful assault on
Clinton's proposed B.T.U. tax on energy, for instance, running advertisements, staging media events, and targeting opponents.
And it mobilized anti-tax rallies outside the Capitol—rallies that NPR described as ""designed to strike fear into the hearts of
wavering Democrats."" Dan Glickman, a former Democratic congressman from Wichita, who supported the B.I.U. tax, recalled,
""I'd been in Congress eighteen years. The Kochs actually engaged against me and funded my opponent. They used a lot of
'resources and effort—their employees, too."" Glickman suffered a surprise defeat. ""I can't prove it, but I think I was probably
their victim,"" he said.
The Kochs continued to disperse their money, creating slippery organizations with generic-sounding names, and this made
it difficult to ascertain the extent of their influence in Washington. In 1990, Citizens for a Sound Economy created a spinoff
group, Citizens for the Environment, which called acid rain and other environmental problems ""myths."" When the
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette investigated the matter, it discovered that the spinoff group had ""no citizen membership of its own.""
In 1997, another Senate investigation began looking into what a minority report called ""an audacious plan to pour millions
of dollars in contributions into Republican campaigns nationwide without disclosing the amount or source,"" in order to evade
campaign-finance laws. A shell corporation, Triad Management, had paid more than three million dollars for attack ads in
twenty-six House races and three Senate races. More than half of the advertising money came from an obscure nonprofit group,
the Economic Education Trust. The Senate committee's minority report suggested that ""the trust was financed in whole or in
part by Charles and David Koch of Wichita, Kansas."" The brothers were suspected of having secretly paid for the attack ads,
most of which aired in states where Koch Industries did business. In Kansas, where Triad Management was especially active,
the funds may have played a decisive role in four of six federal races. The Kochs, when asked by reporters if they had given the
money, refused to comment. In i998, however, the Wall Street Journal confirmed that a consultant on the Kochs' payroll had
been involved in the scheme. Charles Lewis, of the Center for Public Integrity, described the scandal as ""historic. Triad was the
first time a major corporation used a cutout""—a front operation—""in a threatening way. Koch Industries was the poster child of
a company run amok.""
uring the Clinton Administration, the energy industry faced increased scrutiny and regulation. In the mid-nineties, the Justice
Department filed two lawsuits against Koch Industries, claiming that it was responsible for more than three hundred oil spills,
which had released an estimated three million gallons of oil into lakes and rivers. The penalty was potentially as high as two
hundred and fourteen million dollars. In a settlement. Koch Industries paid a record thirty-million-dollar civil fine, and agreed to
spend five million dollars on environmental projects.
In 1999, a jury found Koch Industries guilty of negligence and malice in the deaths of two Texas teen-agers in an explosion
that resulted from a leaky underground butane pipeline. (In 2001, the company paid an undisclosed settlement.) And in the final
months of the Clinton Presidency the Justice Department levelled a ninety-seven-count indictment against the company, for
covering up the discharge of ninety-one tons of benzene, a carcinogen, from its refinery in Corpus Christi, Texas. The company
was liable •for three hundred and fifty million dollars in fines, and four Koch employees faced up to thirty-five years in prison.
The Koch Petroleum Group eventually pleaded guilty to one criminal charge of covering up environmental violations, including
the falsification of documents, and paid a twenty-million-dollar fine. David Uhlmann, a career prosecutor who, at the time,
headed the environmental-crimes section at the Justice Department, described the suit as ""one of the most significant cases ever
brought under the Clean Air Act."" He added, ""Environmental crimes are almost always motivated by economics and arrogance,
and in the Koch case there was a healthy dose of both.""
During the 2000 election campaign, Koch Industries spent some nine hundred thousand dollars to support the candidacies
of George W. Bush and other Republicans. During the Bush years, Koch Industries and other fossil-fuel companies enjoyed
remarkable prosperity. The 2005 energy bill, which Hillary Clinton dubbed the Dick Cheney Lobbyist Energy Bill, offered
enormous subsidies and tax breaks for energy companies. The Kochs have cast themselves as deficit hawks, but, according to a
study by Media Matters, their companies have benefitted from nearly a hundred million dollars in government contracts since
2000.
In 2004, Citizens for a Sound Economy was accused of illegitimately throwing its weight behind Bush's reelection. The
group's Oregon branch had attempted to get Ralph Nader on the Presidential ballot, in order to dilute Democratic support for
John Kerry. Critics argued that it was illegal, for a tax-exempt nonprofit organization to donate its services for partisan political
purposes. (A complaint was filed with the Federal Election Commission; it was dismissed.)
That year, internal rivalries at Citizens for a Sound Economy caused the organization to split apart. David Koch and Fink
started a new group, Americans for Prosperity, and they hired Tim Phillips to run it. Phillips was a political veteran who had
worked with Ralph Reed, the evangelical leader and Republican activist, co-founding Century Strategies, a campaign-
consulting company that became notorious for its ties to the disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff. Phillips's online biography
describes him as an expert in ""grasstops"" and ""grassroots"" political organizing. The Kochs' choice of Phillips signalled an even
greater toughness. The conservative operative Grover Norquist, who is known for praising ""throat slitters"" in politics, called
Phillips ""a grownup who can make things happen.""
Last year, Phillips told the Financial Times that Americans for Prosperity had only eight thousand registered members.
Currently, its Web site claims that the group has ""1.2 million activists."" Whatever its size, the Kochs' political involvement has
been intense; a former employee of the Cato Institute told me that Americans for Prosperity ""was micromanaged by the Kochs.""
And the brothers' investment may well have paid off: Americans for Prosperity, in concert with the family's other
organizations, has been instrumental in disrupting the Obama Presidency.
In January, 2008, Charles Koch wrote in his company newsletter that America could be on the verge of ""the greatest loss of
liberty and prosperity since the 1930s."" That October, Americans for Prosperity held a conference of conservative operatives at
a Marriott hotel outside Washington. Erick Erickson, the editor-in-chief of the conservative blog RedState.com, took the lectern,
thanked David Koch, and vowed to ""unite and fiaht ... the armies of the left!"" Sodn after Obama assumed office, Americans
for Prosperity launched ""Porkulus"" rallies against Obama's stimulus-spending measures. Then the Mercatus Center released a
report claiming that stimulus funds had been directed disproportionately toward Democratic districts; eventually, the author was
forced to correct the report, but not before Rush Limbaugh, citing.the paper, had labelled Obama's program ""a slush fund,"" and
Fox News and other conservative outlets had echoed the sentiment. (Phil Kerpen, the vice-president for policy at Americans for
Prosperity, is a contributor to the Fox News Web site. Another officer at Americans for Prosperity, Walter Williams, often
guest-hosts for Limbaugh.)
Americans for Prosperity also created an offshoot, Patients United Now, which organized what Phillips has estimated to be
more than three hundred rallies against health-care reform. Atone rally, an effigy of a Democratic congressman was hung; at
another, protesters unfurled a banner depicting corpses from Dachau. The group also helped organize the ""Kill the Bill"" protests
outside the Capitol, in March, where Democratic supporters of health-care reform alleged that they were spat on and cursed at.
Phillips was a featured speaker.
Americans for Prosperity has held at least eighty events targeting cap-and-trade legislation, which is aimed at making
industries pay for the air pollution that they create. Speakers for the group claimed, with exaggeration, that even back-yard
barbecues and kitchen stoves would be taxed. The group was also involved in the attacks on Obama's ""green jobs"" czar, Van
Jones, and waged a crusade against international climate talks. Casting, his group as a champion of ordinary workers who would
be hurt by environmentalists, Phillips went to Copenhagen last year and staged a protest outside the United Nations conference
on climate change, declaring, ""We're a grassroots organization.... 1 think it's unfortunate when wealthy children of wealthy
families . want to send unemployment rates in the United States up to twenty per cent.""
Grover Norquist, who holds a weekly meeting for conservative leaders in Washington, including representatives from
Americans for Prosperity, told me that last summer's raucous rallies were pivotal in undermining Obama's agenda. The
Republican leadership in Congress, he said, ""couldn't have clone it without August, when people went out on the streets. It
discouraged deal-makers""—Republicans who might otherwise have worked constructively with Obama. Moreover, the
appearance of growing public opposition to Obama affected corporate donors on K Street. ""K Street is a three-billion-dollar
weathervane,"" Norquist said. ""When Obama was strong, the Chamber of Commerce said, 'We can work with the Obama
Administration.' But that changed when thousands of people went into the street and 'terrorized' congressmen. August is what
changed it. Now that Obama is weak, people are getting tough.""
As the first anniversary of Obama's election approached, David Koch came to the Washington area to attend a triumphant
Americans for Prosperity gathering. Obama's poll numbers were falling fast. Not .a single Republican senator was working with
the Administration on health care, or much else. Pundits were writing about Obama's political ineptitude, and Tea Party groups
were accusing the President of initiating ""a government takeover."" In a speech, Koch said, ""Days like today bring to reality the
vision of our board of directors when we started this organization, five years ago."" He went on, ""We envisioned a mass
movement, a state-based one, but national in scope, of hundreds of thousands of American citizens from all walks of life
standing up and fighting for the economic freedoms that made our nation the most prosperous society in history.... Thankfully,
the stirrings from California to Virginia, and from Texas to Michigan, show that more and more of our fellow-citizens are
beginning to see the same truths as we do."" .
While Koch didn't explicitly embrace the Tea Party movement that day, more recently he has come close to doing so,
praising it for demonstrating the ""powerful visceral hostility in the body politic against the massive increase in government
power, the massive efforts to socialize this country."" Charles Koch, in a newsletter sent to his seventy thousand employees,
compared the Obama Administration to the regime of the Venezuelan strongman Hugo Chavez. The Kochs' sense of
imperilment is somewhat puzzling. Income inequality in America is greater than it has been since the nineteen-twenties, and
since the seventies the tax rates of the wealthiest have fallen more than those of the middle class. Yet the brothers' message has
evidently resonated with voters: a recent poll found that fifty-five per cent of Americans agreed that Obama is a socialist.
Americans for Prosperity, meanwhile, has announced that it will spend an additional forty-five million dollars before the
midterm elections, in November. Although the group is legally prohibited from directly endorsing candidates, it nonetheless
plans to target some fifty House races and half a dozen Senate races, staging rallies, organizing door-to-door canvassing, and
running ads aimed at ""educating voters about where candidates stand.""
Though the Kochs have slowed Obama's momentum, their larger political battle is far from won. Richard Fink, interviewed
by FrumForum.com this spring, said, ""If you look at where we've gone from the year 2000 to now, with the expansion of
government spending and a debt burden that threatens to bankrupt the country, it doesn't look very good at all."" He went on, ""It
looks like the infrastructure that was built and ruirtitred has not carried the day."" He suggested that the Kochs needed ""to get
more into the practical, day-to-day issues of governing.""
n 1991, David Koch was badly injured in a plane crash.in Los Angeles. He was the sole passenger in first class to survive. As he
was recovering, a routine physical exam led to the discovery of prostate cancer. Koch received treatment, settled down, started a
family, and reconsidered his life. As he told Portfolio, ""When you're the only one who survived in the front of the plane and
everyone.else died—yeah, you think, 'My God, the good Lord spared me for some greater purpose.' My joke is that I've been
busy ever since, doing all the good work 1 can think of, so He can have confidence in me.""
Koch began giving spectacularly large donations to the arts and sciences. And he became a patron of cancer research,
focussing on prostate cancer. In addition to his gifts to Sloan-Kettering, he gave fifteen million dollars to New York-
Presbyterian Hospital, a hundred and twenty-five million to M.I.T. for cancer research, twenty million to Johns Hopkins
University, and twenty-five million to the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, in Houston. In response to his generosity, Sloan-
Kettering gave Koch its Excellence in Corporate Leadership Award. In 2004, President Bush named him to the National Cancer
Advisory Board, which guides the National.Cancer Institute.
Koch's corporate and political roles, however, may pose conflicts of interest. For example, at the same time that David
Koch has been casting himself as a champion in the fight against cancer, Koch Industries has been lobbying to prevent the
E.P.A. from classifying formaldehyde, which the company produces in great quantities, as a ""known carcinogen"" in humans.
Scientists have long known that formaldehyde causes cancer in rats, and several major scientific studies have concluded
that formaldehyde causes cancer in human beings—including one published last year by the National Cancer Institute, on
•whose advisory board Koch sits. The study tracked twenty-five thousand patients for an average of forty years; subjects exposed
to higher amounts of formaldehyde had significantly higher rates of leukemia. These results helped lead an expert panel within
the National Institutes of Health to conclude that formaldehyde should be categorized as a known carcinogen, and be strictly
controlled by the government. Corporations have resisted regulations on formaldehyde for decades, however, and Koch
Industries has been a large funder of members of Congress who have stymied the E.P.A., requiring it to defer new regulations
until more studies are completed.
Koch Industries became a major producer of the chemical in 2005, after it bought Georgia-Pacific, the paper and wood-
products company, for twenty-one billion dollars. Georgia-Pacific manufactures formaldehyde in its chemical division, and uses
it to produce various wood products, such as plywood and laminates. Its annual production capacity for formaldehyde is 2.2
billion pounds. Last December, Traylor Champion, Georgia-Pacific's vice-president of environmental affairs, sent a formal
letter of protest to federal health authorities. He wrote that the company ""strongly disagrees"" with the N.I.H. panel's conclusion
that formaldehyde should be treated as a known human carcinogen. David Koch did not recuse himself from the National
Cancer Advisory Board, or divest himself of company stock, while his company was directly lobbying the government to keep
formaldehyde on the market. (A board spokesperson said that the issue of formaldehyde had not come up.)
James Fluff, an associate director at the National Institute for Environmental Health Sciences, a division of the N.I.H., told
me that it was ""disgusting"" for Koch to be serving on the National Cancer Advisory Board: ""It's just not good for public health.
Vested interests should not be on the board."" He 'went on, ""Those boards are very important. They're very influential as to
whether N.C.I. goes into formaldehyde or not. Billions of dollars are involved in formaldehyde.""
Harold Vannus, the director of the National Cancer Institute, knows David Koch from Memorial Sloan-Kettering, which he
used to run. He said that, at Sloan-Kettering, ""a lot of people who gave to us had large business interests. The one thing we
wouldn't tolerate in our board members is tobacco."" When told of Koch Industries' stance on formaldehyde, Varmus said that
he was ""surprised.""
he David H. Koch Hall of Human Origins, at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History, is a multimedia
exploration of the theory that mankind evolved in response to climate change. At the main entrance, viewers are confronted
with a giant graph charting the Earth's temperature over the past ten million years, which notes that it is far cooler now than it
was ten thousand years ago. Overhead, the text reads, ""HUMANS EVOLVED IN RESPONSE TO A CHANGING WORLD."" The
message, as amplified by the exhibit's Web site, is that ""key human adaptations evolved in response to
environmental instability."" Only at the end of the exhibit, under the headline ""OUR SURVIVAL CHALLENGE,"" is it noted
that levels of carbon dioxide are higher now than they have ever been, and that they are projected to increase
dramatically in the next century. No cause is given for this development; no mention is made of any possible role
played by fossil fuels. The exhibit makes it seem part of a natural continuum. The accompanying text says, ""During
the period in which humans evolved, Earth's temperature and the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
fluctuated together."" An interactive game in the exhibit suggests that humans will continue to adapt to climate
change in the future. People may build ""underground cities;"" developing ""short, compact bodies"" or ""curved spines,""
so that ""moving around in tight spaces will be no problem.""
Such ideas uncannily echo the Koch message. The company's January newsletter to employees, for instance, argueS that
""fluctuations in the earth's climate predate humanity,"" and concludes, ""Since we can't control Mother Nature, let's figure out
how to get along with her changes."" Joseph Romm, a physicist who runs the Web site ClirnateProgress.org, is infuriated by the
Smithsonian's presentation. ""The whole exhibit whitewashes the modern climate issue,"" he said. ""I think the Kochs wanted to
be seen as some sort of high-minded company, associated with the greatest natural-history and science museum in the country.
But the truth is, the exhibit is underwritten by big-time polluters, who are underground .funders of action to stop efforts to deal
with this threat to humanity. I think the Smithsonian should have drawn the line.""
Cristian Samper, the museum's director, said that the exhibit is not about climate change, and described Koch as ""one of the
best donors we've had, in my tenure here, because he's very interested in the content, but completely hands off."" He noted, ""1.
don't know all the details.of his involvement in other issues.""
The Kochs have long depended on the public's not knowing all the details about them. They have been content to operate what
David Koch has called ""the largest company that you've never heard of."" But with the growing prominence of the Tea Party,
and with increased awareness of the Kochs' ties to the movement, the brothers may find it harder to deflect scrutiny. Recently,
President °barna took aim at the Kochs' political network. Speaking at a Democratic National Committee fund-raiser, in
Austin, he warned supporters that the Supreme Court's recent ruling in the Citizens United case—which struck down laws
prohibiting direct Corporate spending on campaigns—had made it even easier for big companies to hide behind ""groups with
harmless-sounding names like Americans for Prosperity."" Obama said, ""They don't have to say who, exactly, Americans for
Prosperity are. You don't know if it's a foreign-controlled corporation""—or even, he added, ""a big oil company.""","['Fifth', 'Avenue', 'New', 'York', 'State', 'Theatre', 'Metropolitan', 'Museum', 'of', 'Art', 'Washington', 'Wichita', 'Kansas', 'Alaska', 'Texas', 'Minnesota', 'America', 'New', 'York', 'Washington', 'Texas', 'Austin', 'Texas', 'New', 'York', 'Austin', 'America', 'Texas', 'West', 'West', 'Texas', 'Oval', 'Office', 'Alamo', 'Arizona', 'Missouri', 'North', 'Carolina', 'North', 'Carolina', 'New', 'York', 'New', 'York', 'Texas', 'America', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'U.S', 'Wichita', 'Italy', 'America', 'U.S.', 'Missouri', 'Africa', 'Wichita', 'Massachusetts', 'Deerfield', 'Wichita', 'U.S.', 'Amazon', 'Colorado', 'Springs', 'France', 'Austria', 'America', 'Wichita', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'France', 'Southampton', 'New', 'York', 'America', 'America', 'America', 'Virginia', 'England', 'Cato', 'San', 'Diego', 'New', 'York', 'Northern', 'Hemisphere', 'Earth', 'Arlington', 'Virginia', 'Washington', 'Virginia', 'Washington', 'Cato', 'Montana', 'America', 'Washington', 'Wichita', 'Washington', 'Wichita', 'Kansas', 'Kansas', 'Texas', 'Corpus', 'Christi', 'Texas', 'Oregon', 'America', 'Washington', 'Dachau', 'Capitol', 'Copenhagen', 'United', 'States', 'Washington', 'Washington', 'California', 'Virginia', 'Texas', 'Michigan', 'America', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Houston', 'Kettering', 'Earth', 'Earth', 'Austin']"

Principles_Design_Working Draft.pdf; Principles_Design_Working Draft.pdf
HRC: I am attaching a matrix of prior language that has been used in connection with the major Israeli-Palestinian
issues.
It was prepared in the context of language the US might use if it were to articulate principles, not principles to which the
parties might agree, but it provides most of the language that has been used in the past, with citations.
The USIP Middle East group Steve and I chair decided that rather than issue a static report, we would
prepare/commission a series of timely and specific papers that we would provide privately to the Administration. (I have
sent some of those to your office). They include papers on security, Palestinian institution building, public attitudes in
Israel and the territories, etc.
I will deliver a set of those papers to your office on Monday
If it would be useful, I would be happy to convene a small, private discussion with some of the sharpest people in the
group, or give you some names.
A few observations following up our call this am.:
(1) This (a Framework Agreement) is very difficult but I don't think impossible. If Bibi can say he has secured
unprecedented commitments on security and established the principle of a Jewish state, he could decide to
play the historic leader. If he is uncompromising, he will have to deal with the consequences for US-Israeli
relations. His opt out, of course, is to blame the Pais, but we will be ""in the room"".
(2) I think this should be a negotiation that goes from principle to paper rather than the other way around, i.e. not
an early exchange of documents that dig each side into its positions. The two leaders need to feel each
other out first at the level of first principles, to be distilled after a period by the U.S.
(3) Not sure we need to be in every meeting.. Ultimately, they need to establish some trust. But we (you or
Mitchell) need to be present enough to make sure that there is no misunderstanding of what has been
agreed, and to move things along. .
(4) On the critical issue of security, I don't think the Israelis any more trust NATO to stand firm. They will expect
an IDF presence in the Jordan Valley for some time. Palestinians recognize that there will be a transitional
phase. Question is how long.
(5) As you know, Abbas' position is crumbling. Based on my conversation with him when he was here recently, I
think he is genuinely committed to an agreement. He hopes that, if this fails, Bibi will seem to be
unreasonable. And in that event, I expect he will resign. His minimal requirement is the equivalent of 1967.
This is all tricky business, but I don't think we have a responsible choice not to make this effort. It is the highest form of
statesmanship for you to try.

A Foreign Policy 100 top global thinkers plug for the QDDR
For a tiny bit of good news in such a bleak week, you and President Clinton came in at no. 13 in
Foreign Policy's second annual list of top global thinkers, with special commendation to you for
launching the QDDR (and for cookstoves and women's rights, as well as for your strong position
on American leadership). Michele Flournoy and I also tied for no. 74 on the basis of our respective
roles in the QDR and other reviews at DoD and the QDDR here at State. Here are the write ups
13. Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton
for proving that you don't need to be president to act presidential.
FORMER PRESIDENT I NEW YORK
SECRETARY OF STATE I WASHINGTON
Speaking to the Council on Foreign Relations in September, Hillary Rodham Clinton sounded a confident note:
""After years of war and uncertainty, people are wondering what the future holds, at home and abroad. So let me say
it clearly: The United States can, must, and will lead in this new century.""
Ironically, two of the people most crucial to the new global century are the Clintons themselves: the ex-president and
the ex-would-be-president, the power couple now defined by their position just outside the highest reaches of power.
Except that, these days, both Clintons are more influential, and more beloved, than ever. Bill's Clinton Global
Initiative is starting to feel like a sexier, more effective competitor not just to Davos but to the United Nations itself,
bringing world leaders together to commit their resources to fighting poverty with market-based, technocratic
solutions. As of this summer, his foundation had contributed $23 million and countless man-hours to the effort to
rebuild Haiti. Polls have shown he's a better advocate for Democratic candidates than the actual president, and he
spent most of the fall stumping for woebegone Dems from Orlando to Seattle.
Meanwhile, Hillary showed up in one recent poll as the most popular political figure in the United States, an
accolade she has earned through a no-drama approach to an array of thankless tasks: brushing off Vladimir Putin's
temper tantrum to reach agreement on nuclear disarmament and Iran sanctions, promoting women's rights over the
objections of entrenched traditionalists, and launching an innovative effort to bring clean cookstoves to the world's
poorest. But what she has mainly stood for is American competence, with her Quadrennial Diplomacy and
Development Review a major, if unglamorous step toward making U.S. statesmanship a more agile beast. If this is
what Clinton nostalgia looks like, bring it on.
74. Michele Flournoy and Anne-Marie Slaughter
for setting the tone of how the United States engages with the world.
POLICY PLANNING CHIEFS, DEFENSE AND STATE DEPARTMENTS I WASHINGTON
Barack Obama campaigned in 2008 on the promise of changing not just the style but the substance of how the
United States deals with its allies and enemies abroad, and the job of figuring out how to enact the changes fell
largely to two people in particular. At the State Department, Anne-Marie Slaughter, director of policy planning, is
spearheading the department's Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review. The review aims to rejuvenate
marginalized civilian agencies such as the U.S. Agency for International Development, preparing for a world in
which America's worst threats are not great-power rivals but the upheavals associated with failed and failing states.
Slaughter's Pentagon counterpart is Undersecretary for Policy Michele Flournoy, co-founder of the Center for a New
American Security think tank, who articulated a vision for a new Democratic realism in foreign policy that both
candidates Hillary Clinton and Obama embraced in the 2008 election. In 2010 she oversaw the Pentagon's own
quadrennial review, a blueprint that cuts back on big-ticket weapons systems and focuses instead on the immediate
needs posed by today's asymmetrical conflicts. Flournoy has also been a vocal advocate for Obama's Afghanistan
strategy, albeit a pragmatic one: ""I don't want to suggest that achieving success will be simple or easy,"" she told
the Senate in February. ""We need to prepare for the possibility that things may get harder before they get better.""

The Cable: Granger seeking chairmanship of State and foreign
ops subcommittee
Granger seeking chairmanship of State and foreign ops subcommittee
Posted: 03 NOV 2010 1131 AM PDT
Texas Congresswoman Kay Granger will seek the chairmanship of the State and Foreign Operations
Appropriations Subcommittee, according to her spokesman, ending rumors that she would forgo the post in favor of
some other position.
Although no decisions have been made, until last night Granger was the ranking Republican on the panel and she is
the clear frontrunner for the job. She would succeed current chairwoman Nita Lowey(D-NY), who has served as
chairwoman since 2006.
""Congresswoman Granger is interested in continuing on as chair of the state and foreign operations appropriations
subcommittee,"" Matt LeffingwelL her press secretary, toldThe Cable Wednesday.
When power switches in Congress, a complicated game of musical chairs begins as senior members jockey for
committee and subcommittee chairs. Just being the highest-ranking minority member on a panel doesn't mean one
automatically takes over the chairmanship.
But if Granger does succeed Lowey, she will play a large role in writing the bills that appropriate money for State
Department operations, USAID, foreign operations, foreign assistance, humanitarian assistance, and many other
things. Those accounts all face unprecedented pressure next year as the GOP led Congress will be looking for
spending cuts that don't have strong domestic constituencies.
Last month, we identified Granger as one of 10 Republicans who stand to be influential in the next Congress if
the GOP won control of the House. Since then, we've received several e-mails from sources who had heard that
Granger would forgo the subcommittee chairmanship to pursue leadership of another panel.
We've heard that Ander Crenshaw (R-FL), the third-ranking Republican on the panel, was eyeing the
chairmanship with the expectation that Granger would step aside.
(Mark Kirk (R-IL), the second-ranking Republican on the subcommittee, was elected Tuesday night to become the
junior senator from Illinois, the seat once held by Barack Obama.)
So how would subcommittee chairwoman Granger handle the responsibility of writing the State and foreign ops
appropriations bill? Here's what we reported in October:
Although [Granger] supported the bill put forth this year by current chairwoman Nita Lowey CD-N.Y.),
she criticizedthe increases for the foreign-ops budget, saying, ""We also face the continued concern in
our own country about our economy and the devastating effects of skyrocketing deficits and debt."" She's
a strong supporter of a balanced budget amendment, which doesn't bode well for foreign-aid
funding in this dismal fiscal environment.
Granger also serves on the defense subcommittee, placing her at the intersection of the debate over how
to balance the national security budget and shift resources from defense to diplomacy and development.
Here she seems to favor the Pentagon, saying in June, ""I want to be sure that we aren't increasing foreign
aid at the expense of our troops."" Her lack of support of international organizations was criticized by the
group Citizens for Global Solutions, which gave her an ""F"" in its 2007to 2009 rating. Granger is also
on board with efforts to eliminate aid to countries that are not performing on internal reform, as she
explained when expressing opposition to funding of the Senegalese government through the State
Department's Millennium Challenge Corporation. ""We can't just give out money and say we will put up
with whatever you are doing,"" she said.
The committee leadership assignments won't be doled out for at least two to three weeks, our Hill sources report.
But if Granger's bid is successful, she'll be instantly influential. The fiscal 2011 State and Foreign Ops bill still has
not been completed by Congress, despite that the fiscal year began Oct. 1.
The stop gap funding measure that has been funding these programs since then, known as a ""continuing
resolution,"" expires in December. The lame duck Democratic led Congress is unlikely to be able to pass full
appropriations bills on its way out the door, so they will likely pass another short term continuing resolution. That
would leave the final work on the actual bill to the incoming class led by the GOP next year.

child marriage defeat
The defeat of the Child Marriage bill, I fear, is a harbinger of what's to come. After passing the Senate unanimously, there
was every expectation that it would fly through the House on suspension. How this too became an abortion issue is truly
distressing. We have our work more than cut out for us.
On another note, i ran into Ray and Shaista the other night. They were recently in Pakistan and stayed with Zardari the
whole time. It might make sense for someone to brief Ray. Zardari considers him his informal ambassador to the US.

Posted: i7 Dec 2010 03:08 PM PS'
Incoming House Foreign Affairs chairwoman ileana Ros-Lehtinen. (R-FL) defeated a bill Thursday evening that
would have committed the United States to combating forced child marriages abroad, by invoking concerns about
the legislation's cost and that funds could be uses to finance abortions. The episode highlights the tough road that
the °barna administration will face in advancing its women's rights and foreign aid agenda during the next
Congressional session.
Non-governmental organizations, women's rights advocates, and. lawmakers from both parties spent years
developing and lobbying for the ""International Protecting Girls by Preventing Child Marriage Act of 2010,"" which
the House failed to pass in a vote Thursday. The bill failed even though 241 Congressmen voted, for it and only 166
voted against, because House Speaker Nancy Petosi (D-CA) brought it up under ""suspension of the rules."" This
procedure has the advantage of not allowing any amendments or changes to the bill, but carries the disadvantage of
requiring two-thirds of the. votes for passage.
; Even still, supporters in both parties fully expected the bill to garner the 290 votes needed -- right up until the bill.
failed. After all, it passed the Senate unanimously Dee. i with the co-sponsorship of several Republicans. including
Appropriations Committee ranking Republican Thad Cochran (R-MS), Foreign Relations Committee member
Roger ‘Vick-er (P.-MS), and human rights advocate Sam Brownback (R-KS).
if passed, the bill would have authorized the president to provide assistance ""to prevent the incidence of child
marriage in developing countries through the promotion of educational, health, economic, social, and legal
empowerment of girls and women."" It would have also mandated that the administration develop a multi-year
strategy on the issue and that the State Department include the incidence of forced child marriage during its annual
evaluation of countries' human rights practices.
So what happened? Ros-Lehtinen first argued that the bill was simply unaffordable. In a Dec. i6""
she objected to the Post of the bill, which would be Si.08 million over five years, and criticized it for not
providing an accounting of how much the U.S. was already spending on this (Alba The '
said the bill would authorize $1o8 million, but would only require $67 million in outlays from fiscal years 2011 to
2015.
Ros-Lehtinen introduced her own version of the bill, which she said would only cost $1 million. But in a fact sheet
gDF.), organizations supporting the original legislation said that Ros-Lehtinen's bill removed the implementation
procedures that gave the legislation teeth. ""Without such activities, the bill becomes merely a strategy with no actual
implementation. And without implementation of a strategy, the bill will have an extraordinarily limited impact,""
they wrote.
Regardless, the supporters still thought the bill would pass because House Republican leadership had not come out
against it. But about one hour before the vote, every Republican House office received a message on the bill
from GOP leadership, known as a Whip Alert, saying that leadership Nyould vote ""no"" on the bill and encouraging all
Republicans do the same. The last line on the alert particularly shocked the supporters.
""There are also concerns that funding will be directed to NGOs that promote and perform abortion and efforts to
combat child marriage could be usurped as a way to overturn pro-life laws,"" the alert read.
The bill doesn't contain any funding for abortion activities and federal funding for abortion activities is already
; prohibited by what's known as the almenè"" which has been boiler plate language in appropriations
bills since 1973.
Invoking the abortion issue sent the bill's supporters reeling. They believed that it was little more than a stunt,
considering that Republican pro-life senators had carefully reviewed the legislation and concluded it would not have
an impact on the abortion issue.
Rep. Stephen LaTourrette (R-OH) - the Republican leadership for invoking the abortion issue to defeat
the forced child marriage act in a floor speech .Friday morning.
""Yesterday I was on the floor and I was a co-sponsor with [on] a piece of legislation with [Rep. Betty McCollum
(D-MN)] that would have moved money, no new money, would have moved money so that societies that are
coercing young girls into marriage... we could make sure that they stay in school so they're not forced into marriage
at the age of 12 and 13,"" LaTourette said. ""Ail of a sudden there was a fiscal argument. When that didn't work people
had to add an abortion element to it. This is a partisan place. I'm a Republican. I'm glad we beat their butt in the
election, but there comes a time when, enough is enough.""
But it was too late for LaTourette and other Republicans who had fought hard for the bill, including Aaron Schoch,
(R-11). The bill is even less likely to pass next year, when the GOP will control the House and Ros-Lehtinen will
control the Foreign Affairs committee.
The main author of the bill was Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL), who was incensed when the bill failed
in the House.
-The action on the House floor stopping the Child 'Marriage bill tonight will endanger the lives of millions of women.
and girls around the world,"" Durbin said in a Thursday statement. ""These.voung girls, enslaved in marriage, will be
brutalized and many will die when their young bodies are torn apart while giving birth. Those who voted to continue
this barbaric practice brought shame to Capitol Hill.""
For the NGO and women's advocacy community, the implications of this defeat extend much further than just this
bill. They also saw Republicans invoke the abortion issue when objecting to the International Violence Against
Women Act and expect the new Congress to push for reinstatement of the ""Mexico City Policy,"" which would
prevent federal funding for any organizations that even discuss abortion.
""Any time a health bill that has to do with women and girls comes to the House floor, we're going to see a debate
like the one we just saw,"" said one advocacy leader who supported the bill. ""It's hard to imagine how any
development bills are going to pass in this environment.""
The protection of women and girls is a major focus of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who promised to elevate
the issue Thursday when rolling out the State Department's Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review. She
has said that forced child marriage is ""a clear and unacceptable violation of human rights"", and that ""the
Department of State categorically denounces all cases of child marriage as child abuse"".
State's Ambassador at Large for Global Women's Issues Melanne Verveer has worked hard on the issue behind
the scenes. But at the eleventh hour, when the going got tough, the bill's supporters said that the administration was
nowhere to be found. In October, the White House decided to waive all penalties under the Child Soldiers
Prevention Act, another Durbin led bill that the NCO community supports.
United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) estimates that 6o million girls in developing countries now between the
ages of 20 and 24 were married before they reached 18. The Population Council,
reproductive and child health, estimates that the number will increase by too million over the next decade if current
trends continue.
!
One of the two biggest problems identified in the Afghanistan-Pakistan Strategy Review released Thursday (?• :) is
the Pakistani militasy's failure to crack down on some of the terrorist groups using Pakistan's tribal areas as a safe
- haven from which to launch attacks across the border into Afghanistan.
Pakistan • a major offensive, involving approximately go,000 troops, against extremists in South
Waziristan in October 2009, and its military has also undertaken efforts to stamp out militants in other border
areas. However, the military has yet to launch offensive military operations in North Waziristan, where insurgent
groups wreaking havoc in Afghanistan reside.
Pakistan's envoy in Washington, Ambassador Husain Haggai* reacted to the report by saying that Pakistan will
engage isla.mist groups in North Waziristan, including the •Hartgani network (no relation), but only when there is
sufficient support in all areas of Pakistan's government for the effort, and not until they are confident that the
mission can be completed effectively.
""Pakistan has made it very clear that we are fighting terrorists because they are a threat to our own existence as a
modern democratic nation. We will fight all groups in all parts of our country,"" Haqqani said in an exclusive
interview with The Cable. ""But we will follow timelines that suit our own capabilities and can lead to success.""
Haqqani said that the Pakistani army, which has taken the fight to six out of the seven regions inside Pakistan in
which domestic militant groups operate and suffered thousands of casualties in the process, is simply not in a
position to expand its war on the extremists now.
""Right now, it's only a question of operational capability and readiness. Our armed forces have been engaged in
dealing with flood relief work,"" he said. ""We have to see what resources we will allocate in which part of the country,
and those rather than any political factors are responsible for any waiting period.""
He also noted that ""there is a fragile consensus in Pakistan in favor of military action against regional elements,""
and that Pakistan's government has no choice but to make the decision to attack North Waziristan groups on a
timeline that prioritized Pakistani considerations over American ones.
""Sometimes it's easy for our allies to tell us what to do and for us to tell our allies what to do. But everyone makes
decisions based on their own perceptions and analysis of on ground realities,"" Haqqani said.
In several discussions with other Pakistani officials, an even more complicated picture of the Pakistani position on
attacking groups in North Waziristan emerges. The Pakistanis largely believe that the U.S. government is being
unrealistic in terms of the timelines it wants for cracking down on terrorist safe havens along the Afghanistan-
Pakistan border, which have existed for decades.
, ""There will always be a gap between our two countries because the Americans want things done quickly and done
their way,"" another Pakistani government official said.
; A third senior Pakistani official said that many Pakistanis feel that the ()barna administration is placing too much of
the blame on Pakistan for the lank of progress in the 'U.S.-led war in Afghanistan.
'The U.S. keeps telling Pakistan to do more, but Pakistan keeps telling the U.S. to do more on certain questions such
as speeding up building up of Afghan army, establishing a real process toward reconciliation, and providing
Pakistan the means for large scale operations,"" the official said.
The United States has provided Pakistan with several billions of dollars in military and economic aid to support its
war against domestic insurgents. But many in the Pakistani government have criticized what they say characterize
as the slow arrival of these funds, which they say are in any case too small to address Pakistan's severe problems.
""It's very simplistic to measure success in amount of assistance provided to Pakistan,"" one Pakistani official said.
In remarks delivered during the rollout of the strateu review Thursday, President Obama was diplomatic when
discussing his administration's ongoing drive to push Pakistan to do more in North Waziristan.
""Increasingly, the Pakistani government recognizes that terrorist networks in its border regions are a threat to all
our countries, especially Pakistan. We've welcomed major Pakistani offensives in the tribal regions. We will
continue to help strengthen Pakistanis' capacity to root out terrorists,"" said Obama. ""Nevertheless, progress has not
come fast enough. So we will continue to insist to Pakistani leaders that terrorist safe havens within their borders
must be dealt with.""
Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Michele Flournoy acknowledged in an interview the same day that there
was more work to be done on the relationship before the Pakistanis were willing to fully support the U.S. and
NATO-led mission in Afghanistan.
""Given the ups and downs of our historical relationship with Pakistan, they fear our abandonment,"" she said. ""Their
calculus is very much affected by the long-term commitment they feel from us and in working in a strategic
partnership.""
The White House recognizes that its efforts have fallen short so far. ""The bottom line is that Pakistan is a country
where we have little influence, little access and little credibility,"" one of Obama's aides to■..-:), The New York Times.
The administration's official line, therefore, is to agree with the Pakistani government and express sensitivity to its
claim that they simply can't expand their war against extremists at this time.
""We would like them to move tomorrow, we would like them to take out these people tomorrow,"" the new U.S.
Ambassador to Pakistan Cameron Munter. ""But we understand they're telling us honestly about the capacity of
their military, and when they are able, we are convinced they will move in.""
But for many in Washington, the open-ended delay in Pakistan.s promise to expand military operations into North.
Waziristan represents a strategic choice, and is not just a result of the military's operational limitations. But
whatever Pakistan's reasons, the delay doesn't inspire confidence that the Obama administration can meet its
timelines for making progress in Afghanistan.
""Pakistan, meanwhile, iS hedging its bets, supporting proxy actors like the Quetta Shura Taliban and Haos
iani
Network that might counter Indian interests in Kabul after the United States and its allies eventually withdraw,""
Andrew Extnn of the Center for a New American Security. 'The insurgent sanctuaries in Pakistan are one of
the two Achilles heels in the NATO strategy.""

Posted: 17 Dec iOO C 4:42 AM PST
In a rare instance of bipartisanship, the House of Representatives moved to pass a resolution Friday honoring the
life and work of the recently departed Ambassador Richard Holbrooke.
The resolution C, was sponsored by outgoing House Appropriations State and Foreign Ops
Subcommittee chairwoman Nita Lowey (D-NY), and cosponsored by incoming House Foreign Affairs chairwoman
Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-FL), Howard Berman (D-CA), and Mike Turner (R-OH). The bill is ""a concurrent
resolution honoring the exceptional achievements of Ambassador Richard Holbrooke and recognizing the
significant contributions he has made to United States national security, humanitarian causes and peaceful
resolutions of international conflict.""
""The passing of Ambassador Holbrooke on Monday, December 13th, is a great loss for the American people,"" Lowey
said in a statement. ""One of our nation's most talented diplomats, Richard Holbrooke possessed a fierce
determination and unsurpassed brilliance in advocating for American security, diplomatic, and development
interests around the world - in Southeast Asia and post-Cold War Europe, at the United Nations, and most recently
in Afghanistan and Pakistan. His exceptional accomplishments as a peace-maker, diplomat, writer, scholar,
manager and mentor will define his legacy as one of the true great foreign policy giants of our time.""
Ros-Lehtinen praised Holbrooke as ""one of the most consequential world diplomats of the last half-century,"" and
said that ""his tireless work in pursuit of United States national interests and international peace have put us all in
his debt.""
After praising his career -- which included two stints as assistant secretary of state, peace negotiator in the Balkans,
U.S. ambassador to the U.N., and service as U.S. special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan -- Ros-
Lehtinen called for reform of the United Nations and protection of Israel within its bodies.
""In New York at the UN, [Holbrooke] did much of the heavy lifting on Congressionally-led efforts to rein in UN
spending, to make more equitable the dues paid by the United States, and to improve the standing of Israel in that
multinational body,"" she said. ""Sadly, those concerns have returned with a renewed urgency -- with the need for
fundamental reform of UN budget and the virulently anti-Israel UN Human Rights Council -- and the Congress can
only hope to have such a tenacious, principled partner in the future.""

H: First review of your speech. Goad you used Acheson. Sid
aary's Homerun of a Speech
by Tunku Varadarajan
September 8, 2010 I 12:16pm
Clinton speaks at the Council on Foreign Relations September 8, 2010 in Washington,
,
DC. (Mark Wilson / Getty Images) The secretary of State delivered the best speech of the Obama
administration this morning. Tunku Varadarajan on her ""new American moment""—and why she's
better than her boss.
Behold the Hillary Doctrine. And heap abundant gratitude—and rose petals if you have them on hand—on the firm,
unfussy, deeply reassuring woman who has just offered it up to the world.
In the 20 months since this administration began administering (a verb I use only in the loosest sense), the speech
Wednesday morning by Hillary Clinton, delivered at the Council on Foreign Relations, was the first time we have been
given an unreserved lift of the heart by any of its members. It was, by far, the best speech of this administration. Whereas
her president has frequently wrung his elegant hands, doing the rounds of the world to reassure foreign leaders that
America is a cuddly bunny at heart, the secretary of State declared Wednesday that we are all living ""a new American
moment—a moment when our global leadership is essential."" There was no bowing from her to potentates in robes; there
was, instead, a promise that ""we will do everything we can to exercise the traditions of American leadership at home and
abroad.""
What is so piquant here is not the fact that Hillary understands that Obama is president. It is the growing sense that Hillary
would have made a much, much better president than Obama.
Try this for size: ""The United States can, must and will lead in the new century."" In order to do that, Clinton promised ""a
new global architecture,"" ""built to last and withstand stress."" And in a muscular departure from the way in which this
administration—for fear of seeming Bush-like—has been shrinking from the unembarrassed propagation of American
values, she uttered these plainspoken, unadorned words: ""Democracy needs defending.""
X
Human rights, too, came in for a robust airing: China was scolded, and exhorted to follow ""the rules of the road"" in its
aspiration to be a great power; as was Russia, for its invasion of Georgia. The message: We may live in a multipolar
world, but we have higher standards by far than those who would style themselves as our equals.
Clinton used phrases like ""American might,"" words that we are more accustomed to hearing from Republicans—words
that we've come to believe that many Democrats can't bear to voice. How refreshing, therefore, that she should reach into
a vocabulary of pride that most American citizens would applaud.
Hillary Clinton invoked the name of Dean Acheson in her reference to the need for ""good, old-fashioned diplomacy,"" and
there certainly was an air of the Achesonian, of the statesman, about her speech. Good, old-fashioned diplomacy, it
should be noted, is in contrast to Obama's apparent preference for seeing America as a nation like any other, only a bit
bigger, richer, and better-armed. Clinton's ""old-fashioned"" diplomacy is based, by contrast, on the unquestionable premise
that America is the world's leader. Not primus inter pares; just primus.
In her speech, Clinton referred to the sources of ""American might."" The first, of course, is ""economic power."" But it is her
hailing of the second—America's ""moral authority""—that was so invigorating.
It was Acheson who said: ""The most important aspect of the relationship between the president and the secretary of state
is that they both understand who is president."" What is so piquant here, in this administration, is not the fact, plain to
behold, that Hillary understands that Obama is president. It is the growing sense that Hillary would have made a much,
much better president than Obama.

6434,"Gender- Melanne's Comments on QDDRHRC:
[Huma can you print for HRC]
Melanne is stepping through the QDDR and giving specific edits on each section to ensure the integration of gender.
In addition to that help, she shared her thoughts/concerns on the reorganization as it affects s/GWI. We already
determined from your earlier feedback that S/GWI would maintain a direct report to S (I actually always thought that
even with the reorganization of homes for many of the S offices, we still were maintaining a direct S/reporting so we are
revisiting this issue writ-large for the next draft to you. For example, we now know statutorily that S/CT legislatively is a
required S report).
That said, here is her narrative for your review for when we speak. I have embedded comments in caps in text after
each graph where relevant.
TO: Anne-Marie Slaughter
FROM: Melanne Verveer
DATE: November 4, 2010
RE: Gender Integration in the QDDR
The Secretary has declared time and time again that the empowerment of women is ""at the heart of the foreign
policy of the United States."" Our collective task is to realize this principle by integrating gender into the policies and
programs of the State Department and USAID in an enduring way.
We are concerned that the current draft of the QDDR falls short of this call. In the existing draft, the Office of
Global Women's Issues falls under a new Under Secretary for Civilian Security, Democracy and Human Rights while
retaining the Ambassador-at-Large for Global Women's Issues who reports directly to the Secretary. This new structure
misses the simple but important reality that women are half of the world's population and that the major security,
economic and social challenges of this century cannot be solved without them. These issues cut across the work of the
department and touch virtually all regions, though we place special emphasis on regions in which women and girls
are most vulnerable, such as in countries experiencing conflict and transition. Locating the office within one bureau
makes it impossible for the Office to implement its very charge — to integrate gender effectively into the work of the
entire State Department.
Therefore, gender must be integrated throughout all of the regional and functional bureaus rather than located
within one bureau. Women should be integral to all of our diplomatic efforts—from traditional bilateral and multilateral
relationships, strategic dialogues, and public diplomacy, to our relations with civil society, community leaders and other
non-state actors. Women are also important to consider in all of our policy initiatives, including global health, food
security, climate change, economic issues, human rights, and peace and security. We must institute rigorous
institutional mechanisms to ensure that all bureaus, both regional and functional, consider gender in diplomacy and
development.
In order to integrate gender effectively throughout the work of the Department, we recommend the following
approach to planning, budgeting, structure and evaluation:
Maintain visibility and focus on gender. Retain the Ambassador-at-Large for Global Women's Issues who
reports to the Secretary. This position embodies our commitment to and advocacy for gender equality as an essential
part of diplomacy and development and signals our understanding that this is important to the national security of the
United States. In addition, the office advances a coherent and coordinated strategy on gender throughout the State
Department and USAID. [DONE]
Ensure that gender is effectively addressed throughout all bureaus and missions. We recommend the
following structural changes at State. First, make the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary (PDAS) in all regional and
functional bureaus responsible and accountable for their bureaus' work on gender. The Office of Global Women's Issues
would serve as a resource to the PDAS on these issues. Second, assign specialized gender liaisons to regional bureaus
for purposes of integration, where needed. Third, include training and capacity development for employees on gender
Issues (in both Foreign and Civil Service as well as for political appointees). Fourth, evaluate the PDAS in each bureau on
gender integration in policies and programs (including, for example, as a component in the Performance Evaluation

Include gender in strategic planning and budget allocation. We recommend continuing the requirement
initiated last year that all bureaus include a plan for gender integration in their annual Strategic Plan and Budget
proposal. Each bureau is required to describe how their policies and programs will improve gender equality and how
that will strengthen their work more generally. They are also required, to the extent possible, to outline what portion of
their policies and programs target or affect women and girls. [THIS ALREADY IS IN PLACE AND WOULD BE RETAINED]
Measure impact. Develop indicators and long-term evaluation systems to measure the impact of programs on

Easier to count those who aren't running than those who are
By Rick Pearson, Hal Dardick, Tribune reporters
11:17 PM CDT, September 8,2010
The post-Daley era in Chicago politics began Wednesday with all of the promise of baseball's Opening Day —
no winners, no losers and everyone proclaiming they have a shot at the crown.
With Mayor Richard Daley saying he would not endorse a successor for the Feb. 22 city election, various
political factions engaged in private meetings and a flurry of phone calls aimed at separating the contenders
from the pretenders.
""There will be a lot of candidates,"" Daley said after his first City Council meeting since announcing he would
not seek a seventh term. ""Look at the City Council. All 50 are candidates right now. They all want to be
candidates for mayor and why not? This the best job in America, right here.""
In the anteroom behind the City Council chambers, the scene was controlled chaos as more than a dozen
aldermen — white, black and Latino — happily stepped out of the meeting to give interviews to anyone who
wanted to listen about how they could be the city's next mayor.
But the prospective candidates — following the old political adage that it's ""better to be looked over than
overlooked"" — weren't limited to City Hall.
In Washington, White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel was touted by another Chicagoan, President Barack
Obama's political guru David Axelrod, as having the skills and personality to be a big-city mayor.
Amid all the early jockeying, bluffing and bullying, veteran Aid. Richard Mell, 33rd, outlined the nuts and bolts
reality of mounting a mayoral campaign with only weeks before the Nov. 22 deadline for submitting petitions.
""Someone's got to have some serious money. This isn't something you just decide,"" Mel! said. ""It takes a full-
scale ward-by-ward operation to identify your votes and get them out to vote.""
Mell also talked about the qualities to look for in a winning candidate — someone who will be a ""unifier"" and
""can't be looked at as looking at one segment of the city.""
Still, many politicians were beginning their assessment by gauging the mood of their political base.
""I don't know if it's as important that it's an African-American candidate as it is about a candidate that is going
to be fair to the African-American community,"" said Aid. Walter Burnett, 27th, head of the council's black
caucus, which met in private at the Hotel Allegro across from City Hall.
""For anyone to run for mayor of the city of Chicago there has to be a groundswell of people in the city to
support them ... Everyone has an opportunity.""
At City Hall, amid the swarm of politicians and reporters, U.S. Rep. Bobby Rush, a South Side Democrat, said
it was ""critical"" to try to find an African-American contender who would work for the black community's
interests. But the council's black caucus agreed only to try to come up with a list of topics, such as improving
education, that prospective candidates should address.
Latino council members met for lunch and agreed to meet again within the next few weeks, giving potential
candidates time to develop a presentation to make to them.
""If there's a Hispanic that runs, he or she will probably get the majority of the Hispanic vote,"" said Ald. Danny
Solis, 25th.
""I think more than likely it probably, if you look at the numbers, it won't be a Hispanic in the runoff,"" Solis said.
""But then I think we can play a very important role"" in backing one of the remaining candidates.
But such sentiments didn't deter one of the city's most prominent Latino politicians from declaring that he plans
to run. City Clerk Miguel del Valle told the Tribune he planned to make a formal announcement ""down the
road.""
Mell and many others expect the field for the February city election will be too fragmented for any candidate to
reach the winning margin of 50 percent plus one vote. If there is no outright winner, the top two vote-getters
proceed to an April 5 runoff election.
One prominent Northwest Side committeeman, who asked not to be identified because of the early stage of the
campaigns, said the measure of those candidates who are real and those who are seeking an ego boost can be
measured in two numbers: 25,000 and $7 million.
Though 12,500 signatures are needed for the February primary, politicians routinely get double the number to
ensure they make the ballot. As for $7 million, the committeeman said, about $4 million would be needed to
ensure a first or second place finish on Feb. 22, followed by a campaign of about $3 million for the April runoff.
""I'm getting a lot of calls about having lunch,"" said the committeeman. ""I've told them to call me back when
they get the signatures and then we can talk about fundraising.""
Aid. Patrick Levar, 45th, who is not running for mayor, said this power vacuum reminds him of when Mayor
Harold Washington died and Eugene Sawyer was picked to replace him.
""There's a lot of people who are going to be jockeying for position, but I've learned over the years to sit and
listen and see who can put the different coalitions together,"" said Levar, who is also the Northwest Side ward's
Democratic committeeman. ""Whoever can raise the amount of money and put the coalition together is the
person who is going to win.""
While many politicians were starting those discussions, some key Democratic committeemen said they hadn't
heard from Emanuel, one of the most prominent potential candidates.
Emanuel, a former top political aide to Daley and Northwest Side congressman, has previously said he'd like to
be mayor but has avoided the spotlight since Daley's announcement.
Robert Gibbs, the White House press secretary, told reporters aboard Air Force One that he expected Emanuel
to ""take some time to think about what he wants to do with his future.""
But Axelrod, who previously served as Daley's political adviser, told ABC News that if Emanuel decided
to leave the White House for a mayoral bid, ""the president will support that decision.""
Saying mayors are ""larger than life personalities,"" Axelrod said Emanuel ""has that combination of skills and
that personality and mindset to be a success if he chooses to go that route.""","['Chicago', 'America', 'City', 'Hall', 'Washington', 'White', 'House', 'Hotel', 'Allegro', 'City', 'Hall', 'Chicago', 'City', 'Hall', 'U.S.', 'White', 'House']"

Threatening to Burn Quran
The Union Home Minister Slui P.Chidambaram has appealed to media to help maintain communal peace and
harmony in the wake of reports of a pastor in the United States threatening to burn the holy Quran. In a
statement issued here today, the Union Home Minister said that the act is calculated to increase strife between
different religious groups. Following is the text of his statement :
""There are reports of a pastor in the United States threatening to burn the Quran on September 11, 2010.
The US authorities have strongly condemned the statement of the pastor. Religious leaders all over the world
have also condemned his proposed action.
We condemn the action of the pastor. It is totally unbecoming of anyone who claims to be a man of religion. It
is obviously calculated to increase bitterness and strife between different religious groups. No one who is
interested in maintaining harmony and peace among different sections of the people can condone such action.
We hope that the US authorities will take strong action to prevent such an outrage being committed.
While we await the action of the US authorities, we would appeal to the media in India — both print and
visual media — to refrain from telecasting visuals or publishing photographs of the deplorable act. We
would also appeal to the media to exercise great restraint over the next couple of days and help in
maintaining communal peace and harmony.""

India Condemns U.S. Pastor's Plan to Burn the Quran, Urges
Media Restraint
By Bibhudatta Pradhan - Sep 9, 2010
India ""condemns"" a plan by a Florida pastor to burn copies of the Koran and the government hopes the U.S. will
take strong action against him, Home Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram said in New Delhi.
Terry Jones, pastor of the Dove World Outreach Center in Gainesville has been criticized by U.S. Secretary of
State Hillary Clinton and the Vatican for his plan to burn the Muslim holy book on Sept. 11. General David
Petraeus, commander of international coalition forces in Afghanistan, said the act would endanger U.S. troops.
Chidambaram urged Indian newspapers not to publish photographs of what he said would be a ""deplorable act""
and asked television channels to refrain from broadcasting images. The media must show restraint over the
""next couple of days and help in maintaining communal peace and harmony,"" the minister said, reading a
government statement.
The proposed burning ""is totally unbecoming of anyone who claims to be a man of religion,"" Chidambaram
said. About 13 percent of India's 1.2 billion people are Muslim.
Facing mounting criticism around the world and at home, Jones said yesterday that supporters have sent him
copies of the Koran to burn and he was not convinced ""that backing down is the right thing to do,"" Associated
Press reported.

G.O.P. Leader Is Tightly Bound to Lobbyists
By ERIC LIPTON
WASHINGTON — House Democrats were preparing late last year for the first floor vote on the financial regulatory
overhaul when Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio and other Republican leaders summoned more than 100 industry
lobbyists to Capitol Hill for a private strategy session.
The bill's passage in the House already seemed inevitable. But Mr. Boehner and his deputies told the Wall Street
lobbyists and trade association leaders that by teaming up, they could still perhaps block its final passage or at least water
it down.
""We need you to get out there and speak up against this,"" Mr. Boehner said that December afternoon, according to three
people familiar with his remarks, while also warning against cutting side deals with Democrats.
That sort of alliance — they won a few skirmishes, though they lost the war on the regulatory bill — is business as usual
for Mr. Boehner, the House minority leader and would-be speaker if Republicans win the House in November. He
maintains especially tight ties with a circle of lobbyists and former aides representing some of the nation's biggest
businesses, including Goldman Sachs, Google, Citigroup, R. J. Reynolds, MillerCoors and UPS.
They have contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars to his campaigns over the years, provided him rides on their
corporate jets, socialized with him at luxury golf resorts and waterfront bashes and are now leading fund-raising efforts for
his Boehner for Speaker campaign, which is soliciting checks of up to $37,800 each, the maximum allowed.
Some of the lobbyists readily acknowledge routinely seeking his office's help — calling the congressman and his aides as
often as several times a week — to advance their agenda in Washington. And in many cases, Mr. Boehner has helped
them out.
As Democrats increasingly try to cast the Ohio congressman as the face of the Republican Party — President Obama
mentioned his name eight times in a speech last week — and as Mr. Boehner becomes more visible, his ties to lobbyists,
cultivated since he arrived here in 1991, are coming under attack.
The woman he hopes to replace, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, derided him on Friday as having met ""countless times with
special-interest lobbyists in an effort to stop tough legislation"" that would regulate corporations and protect consumers.
And the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, through a spokeswoman, charged that he ""epitomizes the
smoked-filled, backroom, special-interest deal making that turns off voters about Washington.""
Mr. Boehner, who declined to be interviewed for this article, and his lobbyist allies ridicule such criticism as politically
motivated by desperate Democrats. His actions, they say, simply reflect the pro-business, antiregulatory philosophy that
he has espoused for more than three decades, dating back to when Mr. Boehner, the son of a tavern owner, ran a small
plastics company in Ohio. And fielding requests from lobbyists is nothing unusual, he says.
""I get lobbied every day by somebody,"" he said last month after a speech in Cleveland. ""It could be by my wife. It could be
the bellman. It goes on all day, everyday, everyplace.""
Mr. Boehner — a 60-year-old, perpetually tanned, sharply tailored, chain-smoking golfer — is not as fiery as Newt
Gingrich or as unrelenting an arm-twister as Tom DeLay, two of his Republican predecessors in top House posts. It is his
reputation as a ""Chamber of Commerce"" Republican and his fund-raising skills — he has raised $36 million for
Republican causes during this election cycle, more than almost anyone else in his party — that explain, in part, his rise.
If elected as his party's leader in the House, Mr. Boehner will certainly lean on his industry allies for help as he builds
coalitions necessary to push legislation through Congress, his office acknowledges. His friends say there is nothing wrong
with that.
""Does he have a lot of relationships in this city? Yes, absolutely,"" said Mark lsakowitz, a friend whose Republican firm
represents more than three dozen financial, telecommunications, energy and consumer products companies as diverse
as Coca-Cola and Zurich Financial Services. ""But I think all the good lawmakers do.""
Mr. Boehner won some of his first national headlines back in 1996 after he was caught handing out checks from tobacco
lobbyists to fellow Republicans on the House floor. Then the fourth-ranking House Republican, Mr. Boehner said he had
broken no rules and was simply assisting his lobbyist friends, who were contributing to other Republicans' campaigns.
His business-friendly reputation was enhanced through the weekly powwows he organized on Capitol Hill nicknamed the
Thursday Group, a gathering of conservative leaders and business lobbyists whom he relied on to help push the party's
legislative agenda. The Thursday gathering was disbanded after a Republican power struggle that cost him his leadership
position.
But he continued to routinely meet with business leaders, particularly in his role as chairman of the Education and the
Workforce Committee, and returned to power as House G.O.P. leader in 2006. Several of the onetime Thursday regulars,
along with some newcomers, are among the close-knit group that routinely call on Mr. Boehner's office for client matters,
write checks to his campaign and socialize with him.
That tight circle includes Mr. lsakowitz; Bruce Gates, a lobbyist for the cigarette maker Altria; Nicholas E. Calio, a
Citigroup lobbyist; and two former aides, Marc Lampkin and Sam Geduldig, both now financial services lobbyists.
The tobacco industry is particularly well represented, with both Mr. Gates and John Fish, a lobbyist for R. J. Reynolds,
maker of Camel cigarettes, in the group. People affiliated with those companies have contributed at least $340,000 to Mr.
Boehner's political campaigns, with Mr. Gates being the top individual donor among the thousands during Mr. Boehner's
political career, according to a tally by the Center for Public Integrity.
While many lawmakers in each party have networks of donors, lobbyists and former aides who now represent corporate
interests, Mr. Boehner's ties seem especially deep. His clique even has a nickname on Capitol Hill, Boehner Land. The
members of this inner circle said their association with Mr. Boehner translates into open access to him and his staff.
""He likes to bring similarly minded people together to try to advance legislation or oppose it,"" said Drew Maloney, a
lobbyist at Ogilvy Government Relations. ""That is how you get things done.""
One lobbyist in the club — after lauding each staff member in Mr. Boehner's office that he routinely calls to ask for help —
ticked off the list of recent issues for which he had won the lawmaker's backing: combating fee increases for the oil
industry, fighting a proposed cap on debit card fees, protecting tax breaks for hedge fund executives and opposing a cap
on greenhouse gas emissions.
Still, with Mr. Boehner and his party in the minority, they often lost the fights.
But despite the recent string of defeats on the House floor, Mr. Boehner has benefited from his alliance with lobbyists.
From 2000 to 2007, Mr. Boehner flew at least 45 times, often with his wife, Debbie, on corporate jets provided by
companies including R. J. Reynolds. (As required, Mr. Boehner reimbursed part of the costs.)
In addition, over the last decade, he has taken 41 other trips paid for by corporate sponsors or industry groups, often to
popular golf spots. Those trips make him one of the top House beneficiaries of such travel, which has recently been
curbed as a result of changes in ethics rules in Washington.
Mr. Boehner continues to travel to popular golf destinations on a corporate-subsidized tab, although now it is paid for
through his political action committee, the Freedom Project. In the last 18 months, it has spent at least $67,000 at the Ritz
Carlton Naples in Florida, at least $20,000 at the Robert Trent Jones Golf Club in Gainesville, Va., and at least $29,000 at
the Muirfield Village Golf Club in Dublin, Ohio, federal records show, for fund-raising events.
In June, with the prospects for a Republican takeover of the House rising, Mr. Boehner moved to accelerate his fund-
raising effort, starting what he called the Boehner for Speaker campaign. The idea was to use his high profile to draw
large donations that would be mostly allocated to help elect other House Republicans.
He turned again to the same group of lobbyists, former aides and friends during a July meeting at the headquarters of the
Republican National Committee.
""The wave is there, there is a rebellion in the country, and we have good candidates,"" Mr. Boehner told his supporters,
one of the lobbyists present at the meeting recalled. ""But I don't want to miss this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity because
we have not raised enough money. They might be able to stop us with a wall of money.""
Mr. Calio of Citigroup was among the first to write a large check. So far, a party spokesman said, the campaign has raised
nearly $2 million. Mr. Boehner has helped raise millions more in the last six weeks for Republican House candidates
across the country and the party, appearing at more than 40 fund-raisers.
The Boehner for Speaker campaign offers donors who give the maximum amount special perks, like ""meetings with
Leader Boehner and much much more.""
But his lobbyist friends and former aides said these incentives did not mean too much, because they already had plenty of
access to Mr. Boehner. They just now want to see him as the speaker of the House.
""He knows this is going to be a tough election,"" said Samuel J. Baptista, a friend, golf partner and lobbyist whose clients
include Goldman Sachs and Discover Financial. ""But people who underestimate him really do so at their own peril.""","['Ohio', 'Washington', 'Ohio', 'Washington', 'Ohio', 'Cleveland', 'Washington', 'Ritz', 'Carlton', 'Naples', 'Florida', 'Gainesville', 'Va.', 'Dublin', 'Ohio']"

RAPIDRESPONSEMEMO•OCTOBER 6 , 2 1 0
ANALYST:DREWWESTEN,PH.D.,WESTENSTRATEGIES
Karl Rove is back in business -- directing tens of millions in secret corporate cash to GOP campaigns to
hijack our elections and our public discourse. If he's successful, John Boehner will become Speaker of the
House. But the last thing Rove wants is for Boehner to be seen as the face of the GOP. That's why he's
claiming it's an —inexplicable— mistake for President Obama to put Boehner front and center. Progressives
know better than to take advice from Rove.
Our new message testing shows that progressives should not only talk about Boehner but define him and
his agenda. Every narrative we tested about Boehner -- from his loyalty to special interests and
corporate donors over the interests of the middle class to Karl Rove's efforts to elevate him as
Speaker -- beat the Republicans"" toughest attack language on Obama, Pelosi and Reid. Currently,
Boehner is largely unknown, but when voters are told about him, they don't like what they hear.
The following """"one-liners"" beat GOP attack rhetoric by double digits with both likely and swing
votersii:
The brief statements above beat this Republican attack:
""Obama, Pelosi and Reid have abused their power to impose an expansive government and
destroyed our economy in the process. John Boehner and the Republicans won't let them
continue.—
Does Not Speak for Us or Our Values
We need a Speaker who is also a listener, who can hear the voices of ordinary Americans.
I.] The Speaker of the House is a heartbeat away from the Presidency. Unfortunately, we know
where John Boehner""s heart is, and it ish""t with the middle class.
C.,' We need moderation, not extremism. If John Boehner wants to speak for a party that has
vowed to end Social Security, Medicare and public education--and force women who""ve
been raped to bear their rapist's child--that's his business. But he doesn""t speak for America
or American values.
Cares More about Special Interests
LI Ordinary Americans need a Speaker for their interests, not for the interests of billionaires
and corporations that are outsourcing our jobs.
OIt's not hard to keep a tan like John Boehner""s when you""re always out on the golf course with
some CEO or lobbyist.
• It's time we return to government of, by, and for the people, not government of, bought, and

KEYS TO CONNECTING
1. Emphasize whose voices matter to Boehner: Voters want a Speaker who listens to the voice of the people,
not the big corporations and lobbyists who Boehner represents.
2.Draw a strong contrast between the interests of working Americans and the special interests of powerful
corporations: Speak strongly to populist themes that focus on the loyalty of Boehner and the Republicans in
Congress to their corporate donors, like the tobacco CEOs whose campaign donations Boehner handed out on
the House floor, over the interests and values of ordinary Americans.
3.Focus on realities that are hard for Boehner to defend: the social and economic extremism of his party and
his long history in Washington helping to create the problems we face today.
NARRATIVES THAT BEAT THE GOP ATTACK
Longer narratives against Boehner beat a similar, but more in-depth Republican message, based on language
drawn directly from Boehner and other conservative leaders:
Our top message--exposing Boehner as beholden to special interests--beat the Republicans"" attack by 20 points
with swing voters. Our second highest rated message--connecting Karl Rove""s secret efforts to hijack our
elections to Boehner--beat the Republican attack by 15 points with swing voters and was the top rated message
among Democratic likely voters.
i We surveyed a national sample of 1,013 adults matching the demographics of registered voters from October 2-3, 2010
using online dial testing. We
analyzed their responses as they listened to narratives to understand what they found compelling, as well as their overall
ratings of each narrative and
additional ""one-liners."" The numbers reported here are likely underestimates of the strength of the narratives, as the
statistics refer to the original narratives
tested prior to revising them based on analysis of online dial tests.
ii Swing voters are defined as those who described themselves as anywhere from weak/moderate Republicans through
Independents to weak/moderate
Democrats.
THE REPUBLICAN ATTACK ON OBAMA, PELOS1 AND REID
Obama, Pelosi and Reid have abused their power to impose an expansive and intrusive government and destroyed our
economy in the process. Democrats think they can get away with their job-killing agenda by ramming it down people's
throats, excluding opposing viewpoints and eliminating fair debate. They are turning their backs on American families
and businesses as they continue to tax, borrow and spend into oblivion. John Boehner and the Republicans believe
government should reflect the priorities of the American people--priorities that have been ignored, even mocked by the
powers-that-be in Washington. Obama, Pelosi and Reid must be stopped from raising taxes on any American during a
recession and spending money we don""t have on big government programs no one wants. John Boehner and the
Republicans are listening to the American people and understand that government is not the answer, it's the problem.
""Boehner and Rove""- After the Iraq War went south and the economy went under, most of us
thought we""d never hear again from Karl Rove, the architect of the Bush revolution. But Rove is
back in business, directing tens of millions in secret corporate cash to hijack our elections, running
ads against Members of Congress who want to put the public interest over the special interests.
He and John Boehner aren't working for ordinary Americans. They""re working for the big
corporations that outsource our jobs and get tax breaks for doing it. Boehner""s voted down the

just live long enough. We should be restoring the American Dream for all Americans, not just for
the few, and we need a Speaker who stands with the middle class.
""They found their man""- We need to return to government of, by, and for the people, not

Speaker, he""d speak for them, not for ordinary Americans. Just ask the tobacco company CEOs
whose campaign donations he handed out on the floor of the House of Representatives—which is
supposed to be the People's House, not the smokers"" lounge. Or ask the bankers who played
Russian roulette with our homes and jobs, who got out their checkbooks as he and his fellow
Republicans held a special meeting with them this summer promising to block any efforts to hold
Wall Street accountable. We need a Speaker whose voice is our voice, who'll spend less time
working on his tan and more time working on the problems of middle class Americans.

New BBG chief wants more money to combat ""enemies"" such as China and Russia Posted By Josh Rogin Tuesday,
October 5, 2010 - 4:43 PM
The Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) has a new chairman in Walter Isaacson, and the former CNN and Time
magazine chief is calling for even more money for the BBG to combat the public diplomacy efforts of America's
""enemies,"" which he identifies as Iran, Venezuela, Russia, and China.
The BBG, which oversees a $700 million annual budget to run such organizations as the Voice of America, Radio Free
Europe, and Radio Free Asia, funds breakthrough reporting in some of the most dangerous parts of the world, but at the
same time is facing increased competition from other governments' forays into international broadcasting.
Isaacson said that other countries are stepping up their international broadcasting efforts and that the Congress must
allow the U.S. government to do the same.
""We can't allow ourselves to be out-communicated by our enemies,"" he said. ""You've got Russia Today, Iran's Press TV,
Venezuela's TeleSUR, and of course, China is launching an international broadcasting 24-hour news channel with
correspondents around the world [and has] reportedly set aside six to ten billion [dollars] -- we've to go to Capitol Hill
with that number -- to expand their overseas media operations.""
Isaacson said that combating internet censorship would be a major focus of the BBG under his leadership and that China
and Iran were the prime targets.
""China, Iran, and other countries block democratic impulses using their later technologies, and Beijing has deployed
armies of cyber militias to go after their country's cyber dissidents,"" he said. ""The BBG is at the forefront of combating
this. Through constant innovation and technical evolution, our engineers are opening up the Internet gateway for
audiences in China and Iran.""
""We know where we stand in the fight for Internet freedom,"" Isaacson said. ""Wherever there is a firewall, it's our duty
to storm it, to denounce it and to circumvent it.""
Isaacson was speaking at last week's 60th anniversary celebration for Radio Free Europe, which he credited as
contributing to the end of the Cold War. He made it clear the BBG's outlets will stick to reporting the news objectively,
even if that conflicts with the foreign policy of the Obama administration.
""It's sometimes said that our international broadcasting is in a difficult position because by law and by tradition it's
tasked with two separate missions that might conflict: first of all, covering the news with the highest journalistic
standards and secondly, being a part of America's public diplomacy by accurately conveying its policies and values to the
world,"" Isaacson said.
""Let me say to you, my fellow journalists, that I will stress and we will stress the primacy of the first of these missions,
our mission of being credible journalists, because in fact, it's the only way to carry out the second mission. You can't do
it unless you're credible and telling the truth, and in the end, the truth is on our side.""
Pressed by The Cable to explain exactly what that means, especially in light of reports that the Obama administration
sought to influence BBG reporting after the disputed Iranian presidential elections, Isaacson promised he wouldn't
hesitate to air views that contradict American foreign policy on BBG stations.
He said that the goals of American foreign policy and the objectives of credible journalism overlap about 90 percent of
the time -- as for the other 10 percent, a choice must be made.
""I feel it's the role of the BBG to always make the choice on the side of credible journalism, just as you would in the
private sector,"" Isaacson said. ""We can never compromise our credibility. And in doing so, that will probably help further
the foreign policy interests of the United States. But if it's ever a real conflict, our goal one is to protect our credibility.""","['China', 'Russia', 'Iran', 'Venezuela', 'Russia', 'China', 'U.S.', 'Russia', 'Iran', 'Venezuela', 'China', 'Capitol', 'Hill', 'China', 'Iran', 'China', 'Iran', 'Beijing', 'China', 'Iran', 'America', 'United', 'States']"

other places before she joined us in September. She is on an International Affairs Fellowship from the Council on Foreign
Relations. They asked her to write the following; it was cleared by L. It is quite profound.
By EMILY PARKER
In 2007 I flew down to Lima to interview Mario Vargas Llosa for this newspaper. We talked in his elegant home,
surrounded by thousands of books. Mr. Vargas Llosa offered me a glass of red wine. Then he proceeded to
discuss why he believes that literature can change the world.
Mr. Vargas Llosa's Nobel Prize is a great victory—and not just for a talented and prolific author. His work is
perhaps the greatest rebuttal to those who believe that literature exists on the periphery of history and politics,
or who claim that they have ""no time"" for fiction.
In a New Republic essay in 2001, Mr. Vargas Llosa argued for granting literature ""an important place in the life
of nations."" He wrote, 'Without it, the critical mind, which is the real engine of historical change and the best
protector of liberty, would suffer an irreparable loss.""
Mr. Vargas Llosa's novels reflect his deep, personal hatred of dictatorships and his staunch belief in the value
of individual liberty. He is hardly the only novelist to have shed light on these themes, but I would argue that he
is among the most successful.
Columnist Mary Anastasia O'Grady on the anti-Communist Peruvian writer.
A case in point is ""Conversation in the Cathedral,"" the work that Mr. Vargas Llosa has said he would rescue
first from a fire. The novel is set in Peru, in the dark days of the Manuel Odria dictatorship of the 1950s, which
is when Mr. Vargas Llosa grew up. He told me that this was the book in which he wanted to describe how
dictatorships impregnate ""every act of life.""
To demonstrate this, Mr. Vargas Llosa paints around Odria rather than confronting him outright. The book
opens with a grim landscape of ""uneven and faded buildings"" and describes ""dull and defeated eyes at the
tables of Zela bar, hands that reach for ashtrays and glasses of beer."" The narrative, which rapidly jumps from
past to present, describes a stalled, confused world. You don't know who to trust.
Mr. Vargas Llosa attacks politics more openly in ""The Feast of the Goat,"" which explicitly details the horrors of
the Trujillo regime in the Dominican Republic. Rafael Trujillo was notorious for his victimization of women, and
so we see life under his rule through the eyes of one young girl unlucky enough to have crossed his path. ""The
woman is almost always the first victim of a dictatorship,"" Mr. Vargas Llosa told me.
For some, Mr. Vargas Llosa's victory will be controversial because of his political background and his
outspoken views. He unsuccessfully ran for president of Peru in 1990, losing to Alberto Fujimori. During the
campaign Mr. Vargas Llosa gained notoriety for his emphasis on a market economy, free trade and private
property. He was no less controversial for his support of the invasion of Iraq, which he saw as necessary to
ending what he called the ""monstrous dictatorship"" of Saddam Hussein.
Mr. Vargas Llosa has now left politics, and he believes that he can better shape the world with his pen. Or as
he told me in Lima: 'Through writing, one can change history.""
Not all of his work is dark. ""Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter"" is punctuated with humor, and 'The Bad Girl,"" about
one man's world-wide pursuit of an elusive lover, is a thoroughly entertaining read. The one constant is a
perceptive and empathetic glimpse into a wide range of human experience.
As Mr. Vargas Llosa wrote in his 2001 essay about literature, ""Nothing better protects a human being against
the stupidity of prejudice, racism, religious or political sectarianism, and exclusivist nationalism than this truth
that invariably appears in great literature: that men and women of all nations and places are essentially equal.""

According to news reports, today Republican minority leader and Coppertone model John Boehner will give his ""closing
argument"" to the American people on why they should throw out the Democrats and kill the Obama-Pelosi-Reid ""job-
killing agenda."" He will be returning to his working class roots, speaking at a piping manufacturing plant, an unusual venue
these days for a man who is seen much more frequently at gatherings of Wall Street executives with open checkbooks
and the males-only country club where he works on his tan when not making the rounds at other clubs with industry
lobbyists.
Either the Speaker-to-be is following the model of Michael Steele and free-lancing, or Karl Rove and the Republicans
believe it is safe or even advantageous to bring him out in public after the White House made an effort to put Boehner's
face on what a Republican majority might look like, with the president invoking his name eight times in one speech.
I have to admit that at the time I was agnostic as to whether it made sense to try to brand him at this late date, as Boehner
has minimal name recognition among voters. But the White House was no doubt responding to three realities.
First, Boehner is an unknown to most Americans, which means that, unlike most Republicans in the news, he has not
been well branded by the GOP -- which means for once Democrats might actually brand someone or something first
rather than playing catch-up. Second, Boehner would indeed be the highest-ranking Republican were the GOP to assume
control over the House (other than of course Karl Rove, who is now directing traffic on the right side of the street in
Washington again). And third, a concrete face is always better than an abstraction when telling a story, and other than
perhaps Sarah Palin, who Republicans could alternately accept and decline as the leader of their party, Boehner's tanned
visage and history as errand-boy for virtually every major corporate special interest in his two decades in Washington
(including his stint as the Marlboro Man, handing out tobacco lobby campaign checks to his fellow Republicans on the
floor of the House) made him a potential counter-villain to the Republican's bogeywoman, Nancy Pelosi.
I remained agnostic until this week, when colleagues at Media Matters Action Network and I conducted a national
5urye:y with 1,000 registered voters, selected to match the demographics of the voting and likely voting
populations. The goal was to see how effectively we could speak with voters about Boehner as not only the symbol and
standard-bearer for the GOP but also the water-boy for corporate America. (The results were surprisingly similar whether
we looked at registered voters or likely voters, although as others have described, precisely how to determine who is a
""likely voter"" in this election is as much art as science, and the point of good messaging at this point is actually to change
the dynamics of likely voting, not just to reflect them.)
As detailed in a memo published in Politico, what we found was clear: Boehner is a target well worth defining, who readily
stands for precisely what Americans perceive to be the reasons they would have to hold their noses to vote for
Congressional Republicans (perhaps the only group left who poll worse than Congressional Democrats with swing
voters). We tested both paragraph-length narratives and single-sentence language designed to capture the essence of
those narratives, and in each case, we tested them against the toughest opposition language we could test them against:
the words of Boehner, Cantor, Limbaugh and others combined in defining the ""Obama-Pelosi-Reid"" agenda.
What we found, in brief: is that we could beat a tough GOP narrative about the ""job-killing"" socialists in the White House
and Congress by 15 to 20 points with two narratives starring Boehner in the leading role (with best supporting bad actor
going in one of the narratives to Karl Rove and his corporate allies), and we could win with over 15 different sentence-long
descriptions of ""what's the matter with Boehner"" with margins ranging from 10 to 60 points against a tough conservative
attack on the Obama-Pelosi-Reid axis of conservative evil.
The narratives that most moved likely voters -- including swing voters, who preferred them by double-digits over tough
Republican rhetoric -- made clear whose voices Boehner would be speaking for as Speaker (e.g., the Wall Street
executives he convened to try to block Wall Street reform). They harnessed the same populist anger at the hijacking of
Washington by corporate special interests that has enlivened the tea partiers and is palpable across the political
spectrum, and they focused on the extremism of the party Boehner would Speak for. A narrative that brought Karl Rove
into the picture was slightly more polarizing with swing voters but slightly more powerful with likely Democratic voters.
In some ways what was most surprising was the success of the single-line statements of what we need in a Speaker and
who John Boehner really speaks for (although these single-line statements came after the narratives, and likely reflect the
power of branding, even over the course of a brief online encounter with voters). They ranged from relatively lofty and
aspirational (e.g., ""We need a Speaker who is also a listener, who can hear the voices of ordinary Americans"" -- a theme
colleagues and I found highly resonant across the political spectrum in message testing on the role of money in politics) --
to the harder-edged (e.g., ""The Speaker of the House is a heartbeat away from the Presidency. Unfortunately, we know
where John Boehner's heart is, and it isn't with the middle class,"" or ""John Boehner understands deficits. He's spent
nearly 20 years in Washington creating them."")
If there's a message in this message research, it is at once short-term and long-term. In the short run, if Democrats want
to hang onto their seats in November, they would do well to define this election in terms of the middle class and small
business versus the billionaires and big corporations that are hijacking our democracy; to use Boehner as a poster child
for the party whose primary commitment is to the latter and whose tan is a testament to that commitment; and to avoid
giving voters reason to regret their vote if they give it to Democrats again this time, by supporting the things they say they
stand for and avoiding that golden mean between the public interest and the special interests that finance campaigns on
both sides of the aisle.
In the longer run, branding matters. One of the biggest strategic and messaging mistakes of the last two years was the
failure of Democrats to brand their opponents while their opponents were busy branding them -- and in particular the
failure to brand the Bush Recession as the natural consequence of faded Republican economic principles. Two years ago,
that was a virtually uncontested political proposition, as the voters made clear in handing Democrats the White House and
supermajorities in both the House and Senate. Today, the public is split down the middle as to who caused the recession.
Reality doesn't brand itself. Hopefully it won't take a debacle in November and another 10 million jobs lost for reality to
unveil itself again for a brief political moment and for progressives to have a second bite at the apple.","['Obama-Pelosi-Reid', 'White', 'House', 'White', 'House', 'Washington', 'Washington', 'America', 'Politico', 'Washington', 'Washington']"

H: Dems should demand Boehner remove this GOP Nazi reenactor. Put Boehner in this
blitzkrieg. Sid
Why is This GOP House Candidate Dressed as
a Nazi?
By Joshua Green
An election year already notable for its menagerie of extreme and unusual candidates can add another one: Rich lott, the
Republican nominee for Congress from Ohio's 9th District, and a Tea Party favorite, who for years donned a German
Waffen SS uniform and participated in Nazi re-enactments.
Rich lott, second from right, in a Nazi SS Waffen uniform.
lott, whose district lies in Northwest Ohio, was involved with a group that calls itself Wiking, whose members are devoted
to re-enacting the exploits of an actual Nazi division, the 5th SS Panzer Division Wiking, which fought mainly on the
Eastern Front during World War 11. lott's participation in the Wiking group is not mentioned on his campaign's website, and
his name and photographs were removed from the Wiking website.When contacted by The Atlantic, lott confirmed his
involvement with the group over a number of years, but said his interest in Nazi Germany was historical and he does not
subscribe to the tenets of Nazism. ""No, absolutely not,"" he said. ""In fact, there's a disclaimer on the [Wiking] website. And
you'll find that on almost any reenactment website. it's purely historical interest in World War II.""
Rich lott and his wife, as shown on his campaign website.
lott, a member of the Ohio Military Reserve, added, ""I've always been fascinated by the fact that here was a relatively
small country that from a strictly military point of view accomplished incredible things. I mean, they took over most of
Europe and Russia, and it really took the combined effort of the free world to defeat them. From a purely historical military
point of view, that's incredible.""
lott says the group chose the Wiking division in part because it fought on the Eastern Front, mainly against the Russian
Army, and not U.S. or British soldiers. The group's website includes a lengthy history of the Wiking unit, a recruitment
video, and footage of goose-stepping German soldiers marching in the Warsaw victory parade after Poland fell in 1939.
The website makes scant mention of the atrocities committed by the Waffen SS, and includes only a glancing reference to
the ""twisted"" nature of Nazism. Instead, it emphasizes how the Wiking unit fought Bolshevist Communism:
Nazi Germany had no problem in recruiting the multitudes of volunteers willing to lay down their lives to
ensure a ""New and Free Europe"", free of the threat of Communism. National Socialism was seen by -
many in Holland, Denmark, Norway, Finland, and other eastern European and Balkan countries as the
protector of personal freedom and their very way of life, despite the true underlying totalitarian (and quite
twisted, in most cases) nature of the movement. Regardless, thousands upon thousands of valiant men
died defending their respective countries in the name of a better tomorrow. We salute these idealists; no
matter how unsavory the Nazi government was, the front-line soldiers of the Waffen-SS (in particular the
foreign volunteers) gave their lives for their loved ones and a basic desire to be free.
Historians of Nazi Germany vehemently dispute this characterization. ""These guys don't know their history,"" said Charles
W. Sydnor, Jr., a retired history professor and author of ""Soldiers of Destruction: The SS Death's Head Division, 1933-45,""
which chronicles an SS division. ""They have a sanitized, romanticized view of what occurred."" Sydnor added that re-
enactments like the Wiking group's are illegal in Germany and Austria. ""If you were to put on an SS uniform in Germany
today, you'd be arrested.""
See web-only content:
http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2010/10/why-is-this-gop-house-candidate-dressed-as-a-nazi/64319/
Christopher Browning, a professor of history at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, said, ""It is so unhistorical and
so apologetic that you don't know to what degree they've simply caught up innocent war memorabilia enthusiasts who
love putting on uniforms.""
loft says he does not recall exactly when he joined the Wiking group (his name appears on a unit roster as far back as
2003), but did so with his son ""as a father-son bonding thing."" He says his name and pictures were removed from the
Wiking website not out of concern that they would harm his political career, but because he quit the group three years
ago, after his son lost interest.
loft participated in the group under his own name, and also under the alias ""Reinhard Pferdmann,"" which has also been
removed, and which lott described as being his German alter ego. ""Part of the reenactor's [experience],"" lott said, ""is the
living-history part, of really trying to get into the persona of the time period. In many, not just in our unit, but in many units
what individuals do is create this person largely based on a Germanized version of their name, and a history kind of based
around your own real experiences. 'Reinhard' of course is 'Richard' in German. And 'Pferdmann,""pferd' is a horse. So it's
literally 'horse man.""
Asked whether his participation in a Nazi re-enactor's group might not upset voters, particularly Jewish voters, loft said he
hoped it would not: ""They have to take it in context. There's reenactors out there who do everything. You couldn't do Civil
War re-enacting if somebody didn't play the role of the Confederates. [This] is something that's definitely way in the past.
... [I hope voters] take it in context and see it for what it is, an interest in World War II history. And that's strictly all.""
0
lott at Nazi re-enactment.
Rabbi Moshe Saks, of the Congregation B'nai Israel in Sylvania, Ohio, a suburb of Toledo that sits in the 9th district,
disagreed. ""Any kind of reenactment or glorification of Nazi Germany, to us, would be something unacceptable and
certainly in poor taste, if not offensive,"" he said. ""I think the reaction here will be very negative. And not just among the
Jewish community, but the broader community.""
In a follow-up email today, loft seemed at pains to address concerns that his conduct may have alienated veterans groups
but made no specific mention of possible offense to Jews or human rights groups: ""Never, in any of my reenacting of
military history, have I meant any disrespect to anyone who served in our military or anyone who has been affected by the
tragedy of war. In fact, I have immense respect for veterans who served our country valiantly, and my respect of the
military and our veterans is one of the reasons I have actively studied military history throughout my life."" He added that
he has participated in re-enactments as a Civil War Union infantryman, a World War I dough boy and World War II
American infantryman and paratrooper.
The actual Wiking unit has a history as grisly as that of other Nazi divisions. In her book ""The Death Marches of
Hungarian Jews Through Austria in the Spring of 1945,"" Eleonore Lappin, the noted Austrian historian, writes that soldiers
from the Wiking division were involved in the killing of Hungarian Jews in March and April 1945, before surrendering to
American forces in Austria.
""What you often hear is that the [Wiking] division was never formally accused of anything, but that's kind of a dodge,"" says
Prof. Rob Citino, of the Military History Center at the University of North Texas, who examined the Wiking website. ""The
entire German war effort in the East was a racial crusade to rid the world of 'subhumans,' Slays were going to be enslaved
in numbers of tens of millions. And of course the multimillion Jewish population of Eastern Europe was going to be
exterminated altogether. That's what all these folks were doing in the East. It sends a shiver up my spine to think that
people want to dress up and play SS on the weekend.""

The Political Scene
Confounding Fathers
The Tea Party's Cold War roots.
by Sean Wilentz October 18, 2010
ann Beck's view of American history stems from the paranoid politics of the fifties.
A few months ago, the cable-television and radio host Glenn Beck began his Fox News show with one of his favorite
props: a pipe clenched between his teeth. ""I've got my pipe,"" he told his audience, his speech slightly muddled by the
stem, ""because we're going to speak about schoolish kind of things."" The theme of the day was ""Restoring History,"" and
Beck, looking professorial in a neat dark blazer and a pink button-down shirt, began the lesson by peering at a stack of
history textbooks and pronouncing them full of falsehoods, produced by ""malicious progressive intent."" Progressives, he
explained—liberals, socialists, Communists, the entire spectrum of the left—""knew they had to separate us from our
history to be able to separate us from our Constitution and God."" For the next hour, Beck earnestly explained some of the
history that ""is being stolen from us"": the depression of 1920, for example, or how conservative economics saved the
nation from the ""near-depression"" of 1946—crises that progressives don't want you to know about. ""You've been taught
one lie, I think, your whole life,"" he said.
For the fractious Tea Party movement, Beck—a former drive-time radio jockey, a recovering alcoholic, and a Mormon
convert—has emerged as both a unifying figure and an intellectual guide. One opinion poll, released in July by
Democracy Corps, showed that he is ""the most highly regarded individual among Tea Party supporters,"" seen not merely
as an entertainer, like Rush Limbaugh, but as an ""educator."" And in the past few months Beck has established his own
institute of learning: the online, for-profit Beck University. Enrollees can take courses like Faith 102, which contends with
""revisionists and secular progressives"" about the separation of church and state; Hope 102, an attack on the activist
federal government; and the combined Charity 101/102/103, a highly restrictive interpretation of rights, federalism, and the
division of powers.
During the ""Restoring History"" episode, Beck twice encouraged viewers to join his Web seminars, where they can hear
""lessons from the best and brightest historians and scholars that we could find."" The B.U. faculty consists of three
members, including one bona-fide academic, James R. Stoner, Jr., the chair of the political-science department at
Louisiana State University; the other two are the head of a management consulting firm and the founder of WallBuilders,
which the Web site calls ""a national pro-family organization."" Beck himself often acts as a professor, a slightly jocular one,
on his Fox News program. Surrounded by charts and figures, he offers explanations of current politics and history lessons
about the country's long march to Obama-era totalitarianism. The decline, he says, began with the Progressive era of the
early twentieth century, in particular with the Presidency of Woodrow Wilson, when both the Federal Reserve System and
the graduated federal income tax came into existence. ""Wilson,"" Beck told his radio audience in August, ""just despised
what America was.""
Beck's claims have found an audience among Tea Party spokesmen and sympathizers. At the movement's Freedom
Summit in Washington last September, one activist told a reporter, ""The election between Teddy Roosevelt and Woodrow
Wilson in 1912 was when it started going downhill."" And in April an angry member of the Tea Party Patriots group from
Cape Fear, North Carolina, claimed on the group's Web site that ""the very things you see happening in this country today
started with the Wilson Administration.""
At a Tax Day rally this past spring, the veteran conservative organizer Richard Viguerie described the Tea Party as ""an
unfettered new force of the middle class."" And, indeed, calling Obama a socialist in the tradition of Woodrow Wilson is
audacious enough to seem like the marker of a new movement—or, at least, a new twist in the nation's long history of
conspiracy-mongering. In fact, it marks a revival of ideas that circulated on the extremist right half a century ago,
especially in the John Birch Society and among its admirers.
Beck's version of American history relies on lessons from his own acknowledged inspiration, the late right-wing writer W.
Cleon Skousen, and also restates charges made by the Birch Society's founder, Robert Welch. The political universe is,
of course, very different today from what it was during the Cold War. Yet the Birchers' politics and their view of American
history—which focussed more on totalitarian threats at home than on those posed by the Soviet Union and Communist
China—has proved remarkably persistent. The pressing historical question is how extremist ideas held at bay for decades
inside the Republican Party have exploded anew—and why, this time, Party leaders have done virtually nothing to
challenge those ideas, and a great deal to abet them.
The early nineteen-sixties were a turbulent time in American politics, for the right wing in particular. In the South, racist
violence against civil-rights workers was constant, deepening sectional splits in the Democratic Party that would in time
deliver the once solidly Democratic South to the Republicans. Southern elected officials, in support of what they called
""massive resistance"" to civil-rights laws and judicial rulings, resurrected the ideas of nullification and interposition, which
claimed that individual states could void federal laws within their own borders. Others focussed on what they considered a
fearsome Communist menace inside the United States. General Edwin A. Walker caused an enormous stir when he
resigned from the Army in 1961, after President John F. Kennedy's Pentagon reprimanded him for spreading right-wing
propaganda among his troops and accusing prominent American officials of Communist sympathies. Senator Strom
Thurmond, the Dixiecrat from South Carolina, spoke for many on the far right when he declared that various modestly
liberal domestic programs ""fall clearly within the category of socialism.""
The John Birch Society was one of the decade's most controversial right-wing organizations. Founded in 1958 by Robert
Welch, a candy manufacturer from Massachusetts, the society took its name from a Baptist missionary and military-
intelligence officer killed by Communist Chinese forces in 1945, whom Welch called the first American casualty of the
Cold War. The group was founded at a propitious time. After Senator Joseph McCarthy's fall, in 1954, many of McCarthy's
followers felt bereft of a voice, and Welch seemed to speak for them; by the mid-sixties, his society's membership was
estimated to be as high as a hundred thousand. Welch, exploiting fears of what McCarthy had called an ""immense""
domestic conspiracy, declared that the federal government had already fallen into the Communists' clutches. In a tract
titled ""The Politician,"" he attacked President Dwight D. Eisenhower as ""a dedicated, conscious agent of the Communist
conspiracy"" who had been serving the plot ""all of his adult life."" Late in 1961, after the disastrous Bay of Pigs invasion, he
accused the Kennedy Administration of ""helping the Communists everywhere in the world while pretending to do the
opposite.""
Wherever he looked, Welch saw Communist forces manipulating American economic and foreign policy on behalf of
totalitarianism. But within the United States, he believed, the subversion had actually begun years before the Bolshevik
Revolution. Conflating modern liberalism and totalitarianism, Welch described government as ""always and inevitably an
enemy of individual freedom."" Consequently, he charged, the Progressive era, which expanded the federal government's
role in curbing social and economic ills, was a dire period in our history, and Woodrow Wilson ""more than any other one
man started this nation on its present road to totalitarianism.""
In the nineteen-sixties, Welch became convinced that even the Communist movement was but ""a tool of the total
conspiracy."" This master conspiracy, he said, had forerunners in ancient Sparta, and sprang fully to life in the eighteenth
century, in the ""uniformly Satanic creed and program"" of the Bavarian Illuminati. Run by those he called ""the Insiders,"" the
conspiracy resided chiefly in international families of financiers, such as the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers, government
agencies like the Federal Reserve System and the Internal Revenue Service, and nongovernmental organizations like the
Bilderberg Group, the Council on Foreign Relations, and the Trilateral Commission. Since the early twentieth century, they
had done a good deal of their evil work under the guise of humanitarian uplift. ""One broad avenue down which these
conspiratorial forces advance was known as progressive legislation,"" Welch declared in 1966. ""The very same collectivist
theories and demagogic pretenses which had destroyed earlier civilizations were now paraded forth in the disguise of new
and modern concepts.""
In the worst case, Welch believed, military action might be necessary to dislodge the totalitarians. But for the moment a
nonviolent political revolution would suffice. Accordingly, he designed the Birch Society roughly, if not explicitly, on the
Marxist-Leninist model of a vanguard revolutionary party: a series of small cells that would work in secret to agitate the
populace and elect right-thinking candidates to office. ""It isn't numbers we have to worry about,"" Welch wrote, ""but the
courage on the part of our followers to stick their necks out and play rough—the same as the Communists do.""
The ""Founder"" himself would dictate the society's policies, advised by a council of about two dozen businessmen and
professionals, and the local cells would be overseen by unyielding commanders. ""It is the leadership that is most
demanding, most exacting of its followers,"" Welch observed, ""that achieves really dedicated support."" Welch's group
became synonymous with right-wing extremism, earning satirical blasts from critics ranging from the cartoonist Walt Kelly
to the musicians Bob Dylan and Dizzy Gillespie. The trumpeter, whose actual name was John Birks Gillespie, made a
humorous run for the Presidency in 1964, organizing John Birks Societies in twenty-five states.
Still, the most outlandish of the era's right-wing anti-Communists was not Welch but Willard Cleon Skousen. A
transplanted Canadian who served as a Mormon missionary in his teens, Skousen was considered so radical in the early
nineteen-sixties that even J. Edgar Hoover's F.B.I. watched him closely; one 1962 memo in his extensive F.B.I. file noted
that ""during the past year or so, Skousen has affiliated himself with the extreme right-wing 'professional communists' who
are promoting their own anticommunism for obvious financial purposes."" Skousen was himself employed by the F.B.I.,
from 1935 until 1951, much of that time as a special agent working chiefly in administration. These desk jobs, he claimed
implausibly, gave him access to confidential domestic intelligence about Communism. Skousen also maintained that he
had served as Hoover's administrative assistant; Hoover informed inquirers that there was no such position.
Skousen taught for years in the speech and religion departments at Brigham Young University, interrupted by a stint, from
1956 to 1960, as the police chief of Salt Lake City. His time in office was contentious, and after he raided a friendly card
game attended by the city's right-wing mayor, J. Bracken Lee, he was promptly fired. Lee called Skousen ""a master of half
truths"" and said that he ran the police department ""like a Gestapo""; Skousen's supporters placed burning crosses on the
Mayor's lawn.
After losing his police job, Skousen founded a group called the All-American Society, which Time described in 1961 as an
exemplar of the far-right ""ultras."" Although he did not join the Birch Society, Skousen worked with its American Opinion
Speakers' Bureau, and, in 1963, wrote a rousing tract titled ""The Communist Attack on the John Birch Society,"" which
condemned the society's critics for ""promoting the official Communist Party line."" (This was a tic of Skousen's; he later
defended the Mormon policy of denying the priesthood to blacks with a pamphlet called ""The Communist Attack on the
Mormons."")
All along, Skousen's evolving thoughts ran in tandem with Welch's. In ""The Naked Communist,"" a lengthy primer
published in 1958, he enlivened a survey of the worldwide leftist threat with outlandish claims, writing that F.D.R.'s adviser
Harry Hopkins had treasonously delivered to the Soviets a large supply of uranium, and that the Russians built the first
Sputnik with plans stolen from the United States. A year before Richard Condon's novel ""The Manchurian Candidate""
appeared, Skousen announced that the Communists were creating ""a regimented breed of Pavlovian men whose minds
could be triggered into immediate action by signals from their masters."" A later book, ""The Naked Capitalist,"" decried the
Ivy League Establishment, who, through the Federal Reserve, the Council on Foreign Relations, and the Rockefeller
Foundation, formed ""the world's secret power structure."" The conspiracy had begun, Skousen wrote, when reformers like
the wealthy banker Edward M. (Colonel) House, a close adviser to President Woodrow Wilson, helped put into place the
Federal Reserve and the graduated income tax.
In 1971, Skousen organized another group, the Freemen Institute, which he later renamed the National Center for
Constitutional Studies. According to an article published in the Review of Religious Research, the center's targets
included ""the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Federal
Communication Commission's fairness doctrine in editorial broadcasting, the federal government's change of the gold
standard in currency, all subsidies to farmers, all federal aid to education, all federal social welfare, foreign aid, social
security, elimination of public school prayer and Bible reading, and (that familiar right-wing nemesis) the United Nations.""
Skousen's pronouncements made him a pariah among most conservative activists, including some on the right-wing
fringe. In 1962, the ultraconservative American Security Council threw him out, because members felt that he had ""gone
off the deep end."" In 1971, a review in the Mormon journal Dialogue accused Skousen of ""inventing fantastic ideas and
making inferences that go far beyond the bounds of honest commentary,"" and advancing doctrines that came ""perilously
close"" to Nazism. And in 1979, after Skousen called President.Jimmy Carter a puppet of the Council on Foreign Relations
and the Rockefeller family, the president of the Mormon church issued a national order banning announcements about his
organizations.
Skousen was undeterred. In 1981, he produced ""The 5,000 Year Leap,"" a treatise that assembles selective quotations
and groundless assertions to claim that the U.S. Constitution is rooted not in the Enlightenment but in the Bible, and that
the framers believed in minimal central government. Either proposition would have astounded James Madison, often
described as the guiding spirit behind the Constitution, who rejected state-established religions and, like Alexander
Hamilton, proposed a central government so strong that it could veto state laws. ""The 5,000 Year Leap"" is not a fervid
book. Instead, it is calmly, ingratiatingly misleading. Skousen quotes various eighteenth-century patriots on the evils of
what Samuel Adams, in 1768, called ""the Utopian schemes of leveling,"" which Skousen equates with redistribution of
wealth. But he does not mention the Founders' endorsement of taxing the rich to support the general welfare. Thomas
Jefferson, for example, wrote approvingly in 1811 of having federal taxes (then limited to tariffs) fall solely on the wealthy,
which meant that ""the farmer will see his government supported, his children educated, and the face of his country made
a paradise by the contributions of the rich alone, without his being called on to spend a cent from his earnings.""
Skousen also challenges the separation of church and state, asserting that ""the Founders were not indulging in any idle
gesture when they adopted the motto 'In God We Trust.' ""In reality, the motto that came out of the Constitutional
Convention was ""E Pluribus Unum"": out of many, one. ""In God We Trust"" came much later; its use on coins was first
permitted in 1864, and only in 1955, at the height of the Cold War, did Congress mandate that it appear on all currency.
The following year, President Eisenhower—who Welch charged was a Communist agent—approved ""In God We Trust"" as
the national motto.
In 1982, Skousen published a follow-up work, an ancestor-worshipping history text titled The Making of America,"" and
prepared a study guide for nationwide seminars based on its contents. As Alexander Zaitchik reports in his informative
study of Beck, ""Common Nonsense,"" the new book became an object of controversy in 1987, after the California
Bicentennial Commission sold it as part of a fund-raising drive. Among its offenses was an account of slavery drawn from
long-disgraced work by the historian Fred A. Shannon, which characterized slave children as ""pickaninnies"" and
suggested that the worst victims of slavery were the slaveholders themselves. The constitutional scholar Jack Rakove, of
Stanford, inspected Skousen's book and seminars and pronounced them ""a joke that no self-respecting scholar would
think is worth a warm pitcher of spit.""
By the time Skousen died, in 2006, he was little remembered outside the ranks of the furthest-right Mormons. Then, in
2009, Glenn Beck began touting his work: ""The Naked Communist,"" ""The Naked Capitalist,"" and, especially, ""The 5,000
Year Leap,"" which he called ""essential to understanding why our Founders built this Republic the way they did."" After
Beck put the book in the first spot on his required-reading list—and wrote an enthusiastic new introduction for its reissue—
it shot to the top of the Amazon best-seller list. In the first half of 2009, it sold more than two hundred and fifty thousand
copies. Local branches of the Tea Party Patriots, the United American Tea Party, and other groups across the country
have since organized study groups around it. ""It is time we learn and follow the FREEDOM principles of our Founding
Fathers,"" a United American Tea Party video declares, referring to the principles expounded by Skousen's book. If Beck is
the movement's teacher, ""The 5,000 Year Leap"" has become its primer, with ""The Making of America"" as a kind of 102-
level text.
The popularity of Beck's broadcasts, which now reach two million viewers each day, has brought neo-Birchite ideas to an
audience beyond any that Welch or Skousen might have dreamed of. Several times a week, Beck informs his audience
that socialists (whom he also sometimes calls Fascists or Communists) led by Obama have seized power, and that
patriotic Americans must take their country back. His TV show for some time featured ""Comrade Updates,"" in which Beck
described perfidy while the Soviet anthem played in the background. He attacks all the familiar bogeymen: the Federal
Reserve System (which he asserts is a private conglomerate, unaccountable to the public); the Council on Foreign
Relations (born of a ""progressive idea"" to manipulate the media in order to ""let the masses know what should be done"");
and a historical procession of evildoers, including Skousen's old target Colonel House and Welch's old target Woodrow
Wilson. His sources on these matters, quite apart from Skousen's books, can be unreliable. On September 22nd, amid a
diatribe about House, Beck cited a passage from ""Secrets of the Federal Reserve,"" by Eustace Mullins. The book,
commissioned in 1948 by Ezra Pound, is a startlingly anti-Semitic fantasy of how a Jewish-led conspiracy of all-powerful
bankers established the Federal Reserve in service of their plot to dominate the world.
Part of Beck's allure is the promise that he will reveal secret information. In one segment last year, he produced a drawing
of fasces—which he described, anachronistically, as ""the Roman symbol of Fascism""—and then a picture of an old
Mercury dime, with fasces on the reverse side. ""Who brought this dime in? It happened in 1916—Woodrow Wilson was
the President,"" he said. ""We've been on the road to Fascism for a while."" Benito Mussolini, of course, didn't adopt the
ancient symbol of authority as the Fascist emblem until the nineteen-twenties; the designer of the coin, the sculptor
Adolph A. Weinman, intended it to signify the nation's military preparedness, and paired it with an olive branch to illustrate
the desire for peace.
Beck's readings of Progressive-era politics are nearly as bizarre. Whatever can be said about Theodore Roosevelt, he
was not a crypto-radical. It was Roosevelt who coined the term ""lunatic fringe"" to describe the extreme leftists of his day,
and his concept of New Nationalism—in which an activist government built a vibrant capitalism, partly by regulating big
business—looked back to Alexander Hamilton, not Karl Marx. Nor was Wilson a Bolshevik; in fact, in 1917 he sent
American troops to Russia to support the anti-Bolshevik White Army. At home, his reforms sought to break up monopolies
in order to restore competition among small companies. ""If America is not to have free enterprise,"" Wilson declared, ""then
she can have no freedom of any sort whatever.""
In 2007, Beck, then the host of ""Glenn Beck,"" on CNN's Headline News, brought to his show a John Birch Society
spokesman named Sam Antonio, who warned of a government plot to abolish U.S. borders with Mexico and Canada,
""and eventually all throughout the Americas."" Beck told Antonio, ""When I was growing up, the John Birch Society—I
thought they were a bunch of nuts."" But now, he said, ""you guys are starting to make more and more sense to me."" His
guest beamed. ""Yes, we at the John Birch Society are not nuts,"" Antonio said. ""We are just exposing the truth that's been
out there for many, many years."" Since then, the Birch Society's Web site has run clips from Beck's Fox broadcasts,
proudly pointing out similarities with their own ideas. Last June, an essay on the site described a presentation by Beck on
Communism in America as ""the ultimate in complete agreement between the Beck and JBS presentations of American
history.""
Beck has also praised Ezra Taft Benson, one of Skousen's close associates. Benson, the Secretary of Agriculture under
President Eisenhower and the thirteenth president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, gained notoriety for
a speech in 1966 in which he denounced Democratic officeholders and intellectuals (including the historian Arthur M.
Schlesinger, Jr.) as socialists and Communist sympathizers, warned that ""the Constitution will be endangered and hang,
as it were, by a single thread,"" and praised the John Birch Society as ""the most effective non-church organization in our
fight against creeping socialism and Godless Communism."" Last June, Beck aired a clip from another Benson speech,
intoning, ""Ezra Taft Benson warned about what was coming."" The Birch Society's Web site subsequently praised Beck for
""getting progressively (sorry for the bad word choice) closer to presenting American history in the way that The John Birch
Society has been doing it for over 50 years.""
Beck is no more the sole representative of today's multifaceted Tea Party than Welch or Skousen was of the nineteen-
sixties far right; he recently told the Times, a bit disingenuously, that he was ""not involved with the Tea Party."" Why, then,
have the politics of Skousen, Benson, and the John Birch Society had such a resurgence among conservative
Republicans—not just through Beck but through Tea Party heroes like the Nevada Republican Senate candidate Sharron
Angle? (Last month, Angle gave a warm address to a ""freedom conference"" in Salt Lake City, co-sponsored by the John
Birch Society and Skousen's old group, the National Center for Constitutional Studies, praising her audience as
""mainstream America"" and patriots who had ""heard the call."") The columnist Frank Rich, among others, has suggested
that the election of a black President sowed ""fears of disenfranchisement among a dwindling and threatened minority in
the country."" There are signs that this is so: Republicans' singling out of Thurgood Marshall as an ""activist Justice"" during
Elena Kagan's Supreme Court confirmation hearings, the warnings on Fox News about the terrible dangers posed by the
minuscule New Black Panther Party. But ""socialist"" is not a racial slur. Jim Crow was not built out of fears of the Federal
Reserve and the I.R.S. The Tea Party's fulminations against cap-and-trade, federal-government bailouts, and big
government generally play on very old themes that have nothing to do with the color of President Obama's skin.
The current right-wing resurgence has more to do with the inner dynamics of American conservatism in the past half
century. In the nineteen-fifties and nineteen-sixties, the far right was condemned by liberals, as might be expected; in
November, 1961, President Kennedy devoted part of a speech in Los Angeles to denouncing those ""discordant voices of
extremism"" that ""equate the Democratic Party with the welfare state, the welfare state with socialism, and socialism with
Communism."" But the Bircher right also provoked deep anxiety among conservatives, who feared being perceived as
paranoids and conspiracy-mongers.
The leading intellectual spokesman and organizer of the anti-Bircher conservatives was William F. Buckley, Jr., the editor
of National Review. Buckley was by no means moderate in his conservatism. He was a lifelong defender of Joseph
McCarthy and a foe of New Deal liberalism. But he drew the line at claiming that the course of American government was
set by a socialist conspiracy, and he feared that the ravings of the extreme right would cost more balanced, practical
conservatives their chance at national power. ""By 1961,"" his biographer John B. Judis writes, ""Buckley was beginning to
worry that with the John Birch Society growing so rapidly, the right-wing upsurge in the country would take an ugly, even
Fascist turn rather than leading toward the kind of conservatism National Review had promoted."" In the next two decades,
with Buckley's support and counsel, Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan completed a conservative revolution that
succeeded by keeping extremist elements far from the centers of power.
As confidant and adviser to leading conservative politicians, Buckley had far more political influence than might be
expected from the editor of a weekly journal. Yet in the early nineteen-sixties he found fighting the Birchers and their
fellow-travellers extremely difficult. Even though some of Buckley's colleagues at National Review thought that the Birch
Society went too far, they would not attack the society publicly, for fear of alienating both the Birchers and the
conservatives who sympathized with their views. When Buckley wrote an editorial in 1962 that accused Welch of
""distorting reality"" and failing to make ""the crucial moral and political distinction"" between Communists and liberals, the
magazine immediately lost subscriptions and financial support.
By 1960, Senator Barry Goldwater, of Arizona, was emerging as the great political hope of conservative Republicans, and
he consulted closely with Buckley. At a meeting at the Breakers hotel, in Palm Beach, in January, 1962, Buckley urged
Goldwater to repudiate the Birch Society. Goldwater demurred; though he conceded that some embarrassing ""kooks""
lurked among the Birchers, he insisted to Buckley that there were also some ""nice guys,"" and that it would be injudicious
to attack the group in public. The Birchers' support helped gain Goldwater the Republican Presidential nomination in
1964, and he winked at them in his acceptance speech with his famous line: ""Extremism in the defense of liberty is no
vice. . . . Moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue.""
In the general election, though, Goldwater suffered a crushing loss to Lyndon Johnson, partly because Democrats
succeeded in making him look like a captive of the loony right. (To the Goldwater slogan ""In Your Heart, You Know He's
Right,"" the Democrats shot back, ""In Your Guts, You Know He's Nuts."") Buckley's fears had been confirmed. But he was
undeterred in his efforts to build a respectable and viable conservative movement. In 1967, he favored Richard Nixon
among a field of Republican aspirants. He liked Ronald Reagan's politics, but considered Reagan, who had only recently
been elected the governor of California, too new to national politics. George Romney, the governor of Michigan, a wishy-
washy moderate, was obviously unsuitable, to say nothing of the Republican archliberal Nelson Rockefeller, of New York.
Nixon was a hard-nosed Republican with strong conservative views, especially on Communism and the Cold War; he had
established himself as a Communist-hunter in the nineteen-forties by pressing the charge that Alger Hiss, a former official
at the State Department, had spied for the Soviets. And, promisingly, Nixon was the front-runner. ""It seems to me that we
ought to have a real chance of winning this year,"" Buckley wrote to Goldwater around the time of the Republican National
Convention. He served the campaign as an adviser, and by aiding his friend Frank Shakespeare, who had taken charge
of Nixon's media operations.
But Buckley's candidate had a reputation for shiftiness that made him unpopular across the political spectrum. Some of
the editors of National Review, recalling that Nixon had cut a deal with Rockefeller in order to secure the G.O.P.
nomination in 1960, didn't sufficiently trust him. And the Birch Society had nothing but contempt for the figure whom
Welch had called one of ""the slipperiest politicians that ever showed up on the American scene."" As President, in 1969,
Nixon began to open diplomatic relations with Communist China, and the right wing placed him on its list of perfidious
appeasers. When he visited Beijing in 1972, even Buckley was deeply offended. But when the general election took place
later that year, with the antiwar Democratic candidate, George McGovern, voicing the country's anxieties over Vietnam,
Buckley and the mainstream of what he called ""responsible conservatism"" returned to Nixon. The purist conservatives
were left to back the third-party candidacy of John Schmitz, a Republican congressman and a member of the John Birch
Society.
Nixon won in a landslide, and the next year he appointed Buckley the American delegate to the United Nations. The
conservative pragmatists had found the way to real power. And, despite the embarrassment of Watergate, in Nixon's
second term, their strategy proved effective over time. Nixon's campaign against McGovern sharpened the Democrats'
internal divisions over civil rights and Vietnam, and, Buckley wrote, revealed that the Democrats had ""an indifference
toward national independence and a hostility toward national freedom."" Meanwhile, the Buckley mainstream, having read
the Birchers out of the conservative movement, established itself as a permanent and growing force in the Republican
Party and in national politics.
In 1976, Buckley and National Review supported Ronald Reagan's primary challenge to Nixon's successor, Gerald Ford.
After two terms as governor, Reagan had matured into what Buckley considered a nearly ideal conservative politician: a
shrewd leader as well as a man of principle. Reagan nearly succeeded in wresting the nomination from Ford,
demonstrating how formidable a national figure he had become. The Bircher right had flourished in his political bastion of
Orange County, and Reagan was adept at winning extremists' allegiance while he pursued realistic strategies. His
pragmatic side showed immediately after he finally secured the Republican nomination in 1980, when he chose the
relatively moderate George H. W. Bush, his bitter foe during the primaries, as his running mate. Though the decision
dismayed right-wing ideologues, it had two practical benefits: it instantly healed the divisions between Republican
moderates and conservatives, and it helped dampen charges from the Democrats that Reagan was a reckless right-
winger. Nobody was more pleased by Bush's selection than his fellow Skull and Bones man William F. Buckley, who
understood the political logic as clearly as Reagan had.
As President, Reagan flattered the extremists—he even delivered some admiring words about Skousen's Freemen
Institute—but he saved his political capital for his real goals: undoing the fiscal underpinnings of New Deal-style
government, and redirecting U.S. foreign policy by battling the Soviet Union and its proxies around the world. He
appointed moderates to positions of importance, as when he made James Baker III, Bush's close associate, his first chief
of staff, rather than the far more ideological Edwin Meese III, his former chief of staff from California. (As a top policy
adviser, Meese helped Reagan stack the federal bench with conservatives, but he was otherwise eclipsed by Baker and
Baker's deputy, the pragmatic Reaganite Michael Deaver, and his crusade, as Attorney General, to roll back civil-rights
legislation largely failed.) When zealots in the Administration were exposed, as in the Iran-Contra scandal, Reagan
skillfully evaded responsibility and replaced them with more centrist Republicans. And, when he recognized in Mikhail
Gorbachev a Soviet leader with whom he could undertake genuine efforts to reduce the nuclear threat, Reagan pushed
forward, ignoring the complaints that he had become, in the hard-liner Howard Phillips's phrase, ""a useful idiot for Soviet
propaganda.""
Whatever misgivings may have arisen about him on the right, Reagan achieved a dramatic conservative overhaul of the
federal tax code, a profound reconfiguring of the judiciary, and a near-victory for the West in the Cold War. From the
standpoint of the mainstream right, the only problem with his legacy was that no other Republican could come close to
matching his public appeal and political savvy. For the party of Reagan, his departure was the beginning of a long decline,
and it is the absence of a similarly totemic figure, during the past twenty years, that has allowed the current resurgence of
extremism. George H. W. Bush repelled right-wingers with his moderate tendencies—not least when, in the face of fiscal
calamity, he broke his campaign pledge not to raise taxes. Bill Clinton inspired them to an almost ecstatic series of
attacks, and though there remained enough of an older conservative establishment, personified by Senator Bob Dole, to
check some of the wildest charges, the new Republican House majority after 1994, pushed by such ideologues as Tom
DeLay and Dick Armey, had little interest in maintaining the center. They harassed Clinton, forcing an impeachment even
though polls showed that more than sixty per cent of the American people disapproved. George W. Bush seemed at first
to have a bit of Reagan's conservative charisma, but the right wing turned against him for failing to win the war in Iraq, for
his moderate position on immigration, and for spending hundreds of millions of federal dollars to combat the financial
collapse in 2008. When William F. Buckley died, during the 2008 primary season, it seemed to symbolize the end of a
conservative era. David Klinghoffer, a former literary editor at National Review, lamented that ""urbane visionaries and
builders of institutions"" such as Buckley have been replaced by media figures ""who make their money by stirring fears and
resentments."" Conservatism, Klinghoffer added, ""has undergone a shift toward demagoguery and hucksterism,"" and is
now ruled by those he called ""the crazy-cons.""
Some Republicans have tried to extend the Buckley tradition, but to little effect. The commentator David Frum, a former
speechwriter for George W. Bush, lost his job at the American Enterprise Institute after he complained about the
Republicans' obstruction of health-care reform and called the right-wing surge a threat to conservatism. In June, the
congressman Bob Inglis, of South Carolina, a tough conservative who nonetheless backed Bush's financial bailout, lost a
vicious primary fight with a right-wing insurgent named Trey Gowdy. To his amazement, Inglis was confronted on the
campaign trail by voters who were convinced that numbers on their Social Security cards indicated that a secret bank had
bought them at birth. ""And then, of course,"" he recalls, ""it turned into something about the Federal Reserve and the
Bilderbergers and all that stuff."" Not even Karl Rove can afford open dissent with the Tea Partiers. Appearing on Fox
News the night of the recent primaries, he described the Tea Party-backed Senate candidate in Delaware, Christine
O'Donnell, as probably unelectable and said that some of her statements were ""nutty."" Instantly, criticism came from
Sarah Palin, Rush Limbaugh, and other right-wing Republicans. Within days, he was back on Fox, proclaiming himself ""a
huge Tea Party fan,"" endorsing O'Donnell, and affirming that the National Republican Senatorial Committee would give
her its full backing.
So far, Rove, an unlikely dissident, is the only prominent Republican leader to so much as gesture at stepping forward, as
Buckley and his allies did. Even strong conservatives like Inglis have been pushed aside, as have such former G.O.P.
stalwarts as Charlie Crist, in Florida, and Mike Castle, in Delaware, both beaten in the primaries by Tea Party candidates;
Grist is now running a long-shot campaign as an Independent. Desperate for gains in the midterm elections, the
Republicans are neglecting the struggle it took to make politics safe for Reagan.
Fifty years ago, President Kennedy deplored the far right's ""counsels of fear and suspicion."" Today, Obama's White
House is still struggling to make sense of its enemies. In the absence of forthright leadership, on both the right and the
left, the job of standing up to extremists appears to have been left to the electorate. Candidates like O'Donnell may prove
too eccentric to prevail, or voters may simply become disillusioned by politicians who campaign on their hatred of
government. After the election, mainstream conservatives may well engage in what Richard Viguerie has forecast as ""a
massive, almost historic battle for the heart and soul of the Republican Party."" (Already, Rove and some leading Bush
political operatives, including the former Republican National Committee chairman Ed Gillespie, have been quietly
supplanting the battered G.O.P. establishment in the effort to raise funds for this year's candidates.) But, according to a
recent poll, more than seventy per cent of Republicans support the Tea Party, and it seems almost certain that a
Republican Party that has unstintingly appeased the far right will enjoy a strong and perhaps smashing victory in the
coming midterm elections.
In 1906, early in the Progressive era, the humorist Finley Peter Dunne's fictional barroom sage, Mr. Dooley, put the social
and political tumult of the day into perspective. ""Th' noise ye hear is not th' first gun iv a revolution,"" Dooley remarked. ""It's
on'y th' people iv th' United States batin' a carpet."" A century from now, or even a year from now, Americans may say the
same about the Tea Party. For the moment, though, it appears that the extreme right wing is on the verge of securing a
degree of power over Congress and the Republican Party that is unprecedented in modern American history. For
defenders of national cohesion and tempered adversity in our politics, it is an alarming state of affairs. •

Why Obama Is Losing the Political War
By Mark Halperin
Barack Obama is being politically crushed in a vise. From above, by elite opinion about his competence. From below, by
mass anger and anxiety over unemployment. And it is too late for him to do anything about this predicament until after
November's elections.
With the exception of core Obama Administration loyalists, most politically engaged elites have reached the same
conclusions: the White House is in over its head, isolated, insular, arrogant and clueless about how to get along with or
persuade members of Congress, the media, the business community or working-class voters. This view is held by Fox
News pundits, executives and anchors at the major old-media outlets, reporters who cover the White House, Democratic
and Republican congressional leaders and governors, many Democratic business people and lawyers who raised big
money for Obama in 2008, and even some members of the Administration just beyond the inner circle. (See Obama's
troubled first year, issue by issue.)
On Friday, after the release of the latest bleak unemployment data — the last major jobs figures before the midterms —
Obama said, ""Putting the American people back to work, expanding opportunity, rebuilding the economic security of the
middle class is the moral and national challenge of our time."" But elites feel the President has failed to meet that challenge
and are convinced he will be unable to do so in the remainder of his term. Moreover, there is a growing perception that
Obama's decisions are causing harm — that businesses are being hurt by the Administration's legislation and that
economic recovery is stalling because of the uncertainty surrounding energy policy, health care, deficits, housing,
immigration and spending.
And that sentiment is spreading. Many members of the general public appear deeply skeptical of Obama's capacity to turn
things around, especially, but not exclusively, those inclined to dislike him — Tea Partyers and John McCain voters, but
also tens of millions of middle-class Americans, including quite a few who turned out for Obama in 2008. (See how some
Americans are facing the prospect of long-term unemployment.)
The misery afflicting the country has no political affiliation. Listen to the voices from this striking TV ad for Rob Portman,
the Republican former Congressman and Bush budget director who is running for Senate from Ohio. One woman at a
Dayton career fair says starkly, ""There are no jobs."" A man announces plaintively and with obvious frustration, ""I've been
looking for a job now for 13 months."" Events like this job fair are becoming the grim iconic gatherings of our time, the
breadlines for the Obama years.
Most of Obama's private (and sometimes public) rebuttals to the voices slamming him on all sides are justified or spot on.
He did inherit a lot of problems from the Bush Administration. He did act quickly in the initial weeks of his Administration to
stave off a worldwide depression. His efforts at job creation have been obstructed by Republicans (even the proposals
based on policies supported by the GOP in the past). His opponents haven't put forth specifics of their own, nor offered
genuine compromise, while the media have allowed the right's activists and gabbers to run wild with criticism without
furnishing legitimate alternative solutions. (See Barack Obama's top 10 sound bites.)
But Obama has exacerbated his political problems not just by failing to enact policies that would have actually turned the
economy around, but also by authorizing a series of tactical moves intended to demonize Republicans and distract from
the problems at hand. He has wasted time lambasting his foes when he should have been putting forth his agenda in a
clear, optimistic fashion, defending the benefits of his key decisions during the past two years (health care and the
Troubled Asset Relief Program, for example) and explaining what he would do with a re-elected Democratic majority to
spur growth.
Throughout the year, we have been treated to Obama-led attacks on George W. Bush and Dick Cheney, Rush Limbaugh,
Congressman Joe Barton (for his odd apology to BP), John Boehner (for seeking the speakership — or was it something
about an ant?) and Fox News (for everything). Suitable Democratic targets in some cases, perhaps, but not worth the time
of a busy Commander in Chief. In the past few days, we have witnessed the spectacle of the President himself and his
top advisers wading into allegations that Republicans are attempting to buy the election using foreign money laundered
through the Chamber of Commerce, combining with Karl Rove and his wealthy backers to fund a flood of negative
television commercials. Not only is this issue convoluted and far-fetched, but it also distracts from the issues voters care
about, frustrating political insiders and alienating struggling citizens (not that many are following such an offbeat story
line). Feinting and gibing can't obscure those job numbers. (See the best viral campaign ads of 2010.)
The President and Democrats have passed many significant measures (the stimulus spending, the auto-company rescue,
the health care law and the financial regulation effort) that someday may be seen as brave and bold, the foundation for a
better economy. Obama and his closest aides certainly think that will happen. But the President was correct when he said
Friday, ""the only piece of economic news that folks still looking for work want to hear is, 'You're hired,"" and that's still not
occurring for too many Americans.
The politically good news for Obama is that no matter what the outcome of the midterm elections, everything changes in
January. Republicans will have a greater obligation, politically and morally, to help govern, rather than thwart and badger.
The President will get a chance, in his State of the Union address and in his budget proposal, to show he is turning the
page on the political horrors of 2010 for his party and the nation. But before then, Republicans are almost certainly going
to demonstrate that you can beat something with nothing, especially when Americans seem to think that the Obama
Administration hasn't much to offer either, except more of the same that isn't working.

Goodbye, Mr. Jones
And good riddance. Why Jim Jones was the worst national
security advisor in decades.
BY DAVID J. ROTHKOPF I OCTOBER 8, 2010
The president's inexperience did in Jones more than any of the general's deficits. He didn't know what he wanted. He
vacillated on key issues. He simply demonstrated the problems America repeatedly has when it hires men with no foreign-
policy background to take on the most important international job in the world. Further, he did not really know enough
about how the presidency works to nip in the bud the creation of the inner-circle bubble that effectively negated much of
the work that the formal policy process did. Obama encouraged (or tolerated for long-enough that it looks like
encouragement) his campaign foreign-policy deputies to continue to report directly to him, and this led to some public and
private backdooring of Jones that undercut his authority dramatically. He did not empower Jones, and that combined with
Jones's own shortcomings led to the zero-chemistry, ineffective collaboration that has been openly criticized by senior
White House and foreign policy officials since the spring of Obama's first year in office.
In fact the situation got so bad that Jones was publicly undercut by true Obama confidante Denis McDonough more than
once. It is something of a surprise he lasted this long. As one former national security advisor said to me while we were
discussing a well-known instance of McDonough publicly undercutting Jones, ""That would have only happened once on
my watch. It would have been me or him.""","['America', 'White', 'House']"

The Power Of Clinton, The Invisibility Of
Obama
First Posted: 10-12-10 02:37 PM I Updated: 10-12-10 02:37 PM
LOUISVILLE -- I see that Dr. Rand Paul has taken out after Bill Clinton, dredging up Monica Lewinsky. And I know why
Paul did so. The former president was here in Kentucky yesterday and in this state, as in many others, he is a far more
potent and popular foe than President Barack Obama.
On my first day working for The Huffington Post, I came back to Kentucky, where I began my career many years ago at
the Courier-Journal. The people who run the University of Louisville Kentucky Author Forum wanted me to do an on-stage
interview with a certain best-selling author who is also my new boss: Arianna Huffington. It was a tricky mix of professional
incest and personal nostalgia, but the event worked out well and I also got a chance to play Kentucky reporter once again
out in the state.
I raced over to Lexington and here is the ground-level, outside-the-Beltway reality I witnessed:
Like Voldemort's, Obama's is a name no one dares utter -- and that includes Clinton speaking to Democrats.
At a sunny, noontime rally on the campus of the University of Kentucky in Lexington yesterday, the former president made
a stirring, well-argued case for Democratic Senate candidate Jack Conway and for Democrats generally -- without once
mentioning Obama and rarely mentioning the presidency. It was as though we suddenly had only two branches of
government.
To be fair, almost no one else at the one-hour rally mentioned the sitting president. And Kentucky is staunch Republican
territory. ""We're farther ahead in the generic ballot here than ever,"" GOP Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky told me
yesterday. ""President Obama was never popular here, even at his peak.""
Still, the eerie invisibility of the president is a telling commentary on the Democrats' confused, divided and defensive
predicament as they brace for the verdict of the voters on Election Day, Nov. 2. There was something odd -- and, if you're
a Democrat, depressing -- about a former Democratic president avoiding any mention of his Democratic successor.
Clinton sincerely wants to help out on the trail -- and certainly wants to avoid the accusation that he didn't try to help. But
his travels have turned into a personal victory lap that often makes him -- not the candidate he's touting -- the center of
attention. That was true here in Kentucky. The rally's mechanics were mostly handled by the Secret Service; more to the
point, the final (and therefore top-billed) speaker wasn't Conway. It was Clinton. The Conway people didn't mind. They
were glad to have him.
Rail-thin but not frail, wearing a tweedy professorial sports coat and his signature rueful, knowing smile, Clinton was
treated with a respect bordering on awe. His familiar mane of white hair, thinning now, was translucent in the sun, giving
him an almost otherworldly look: the Sage from a Better Age.
Clinton is beloved In Kentucky. He won the state twice. He speaks the local dialect, which contains Appalachian notes of
working-class pride, suspicion of big shots and Baptist revivalism. But more than that -- and more than just in Kentucky --
Clinton's economic record (22.7 million jobs created, and he tends not to forget to mention the .7) looks spectacularly
good in the context of what has followed.
These days there is almost an Old Testament, milk-and-honey reverence for that economic record, at least as expressed
by former Kentucky Sen. Wendell Ford. An old-school podium pounder, Ford -- stooped but still strong voiced at 86 --
talked of the former president in messianic terms. ""Bill Clinton found us the path to gold!"" he shouted. The crowd of 2,000,
most of them students, didn't laugh. They seemed to think he was right.
How any of this helps Obama is far from clear; it isn't even clear that it helps many Democrats -- since they'd be joining
the same Washington party that the current president ostensibly heads.
But Clinton is all too happy to show Obama how it's done. As a campaigner and as president, Clinton's gift was his ability
to untangle the knots of even the most complex policy issue and explain it in plain language to people suspicious of the
powerful -- but eager not to be screwed by them or to be seen as dupes. Republicans and their corporate allies were out
to shut down the few good things that government does for you, he said, in the name of balancing a budget that they
themselves destroyed. ""I gave you budget surpluses!"" Clinton said, as if this had been an act of personal beneficence.
Knowing his audience, the former president focused on Pell Grants, and on a new program that allows graduates to pay
back their loans over longer periods and at lower rates. Paul, he said, will try to take that new program away -- and, given
the GOP's deliberate vagueness about spending cuts -- there is reason to think Clinton is right.
Which is why Paul got personal today. Which means Clinton drew blood. Which means that he did what he came to do.
Which means Obama will remain invisible, at least in Kentucky, at least for now, and probably for a long time to come.

When we were in Government we believed we could only succeed if we treated
Northern Ireland as a bi-partisan issue and I encouraged other Governments
to adopt the same approach. That meant when President Bush was in the White
House, I went out of my way always to see and brief Democrats - in Congress
and in the Senate - whenever I came to the States. It also meant when we
held the first economic conference led by Mayor Bloomberg in Belfast, the
dinner we gave at Hillsborough was not restricted to just those in

In respect of how we handled the issue within the UK, that didn't mean I
invited the Shadow Secretary of State to share every platform, but the
Shadow was not excluded from being at major events. Indeed we made a point
of not only saying we were bi-partisan, but acted accordingly.
Having brokered the Hillsborough Agreement and having discussed with your
Secretary of State - at all stages - how the US could help through an
Economic Conference, I am obviously somewhat disappointed not to have been
invited to attend the Conference in any capacity.
That of course should never be confused with my deep respect and adMiration

The current coalition Government in Britain will not always be in power and
it may not even last the course. It seems regrettable that in such a
challenging global economic environment that those of us who helped build

The Crossroads Nation
By DAVID BROOKS
Bill Clinton used to talk about building a bridge to the 21st century. President Obama talks about laying down a ""new foundation."" But
Clinton was always vague about what the land on the other side of that bridge was going to look like, and Obama is vague about what
edifice is going to go on top of that foundation.
They are vague because nobody is clear about what sort of country America is going to be in 2030 or 2050. Nobody has quite defined
America's coming economic identity.
In thinking about this question, it probably helps to start at the beginning. Five hundred years ago, agriculture was the major economic
activity. One hundred years ago, it was industrial production. Now, of course, we're living in an information age. Innovation and
creativity are the engines of economic growth.
Howard Gardner of Harvard once put together a composite picture of the extraordinarily creative person: She comes from a little place
somewhat removed from the center of power and influence. As an adolescent, she feels herself outgrowing her own small circle. She
moves to a metropolis and finds a group of people who share her passions and interests. She gets involved with a team to create
something amazing.
Then, at some point, she finds her own problem, which is related to and yet different from the problems that concern others in her
group. She breaks off and struggles and finally emerges with some new thing. She brings it back to her circle. It is tested, refined and
improved.
The main point in this composite story is that creativity is not a solitary process. It happens within networks. It happens when talented
people get together, when idea systems and mentalities merge.
Now imagine you are this creative person in the year 2010, 2025 or 2050. You are living in some small town in Ukraine or Kenya or
some other place, foreign or domestic. You long to break out and go to a place where people are gathering to think about the things you
are thinking about, creating the things you want to create.
If you are passionate about fashion, maybe you will go to Paris. If it's engineering, maybe it'll be Germany. But if you are passionate
about many other spheres, I suspect you'll want to be in America.
You'll want to be in the U.S. because English has become the global language. You'll want to come because American universities lead
the world in research and draw many of the best minds from all corners of the earth.
You'll want to be there because American institutions are relatively free from corruption. Intellectual property is protected. Huge
venture capital funds already exist.
Moreover, the United States is a universal nation. There are already people there with connections all over the world. A nation of
immigrants is more permeable than say, Chinese society.
You also observe that America hosts the right kind of networks — ones that are flexible and intense. Study after study suggests that
America is one of those societies with high social trust. Americans build large, efficient organizations that are not bound by the circles of
kinship and clan. Study after study finds that Americans are not hierarchical. American children are raised to challenge their parents.
American underlings are relatively free to challenge their bosses. In this country you're less likely to have to submit to authority.
From this story you can see that economic power in the 21st century is not going to look like economic power in the 20th century. The
crucial fact about the new epoch is that creativity needs hubs. Information networks need junction points. The nation that can make
itself the crossroads to the world will have tremendous economic and political power.
In 2009, Anne-Marie Slaughter, now director of policy planning at the State Department, wrote an essay for Foreign Affairs in which
she laid out the logic of this new situation: ""In a networked world, the issue is no longer relative power, but centrality in an increasingly
dense global web.""
Slaughter's essay was titled ""America's Edge."" That is apt. Americans are now in a depressed state of mind. As China and India rise,
nearly two-thirds of Americans believe their nation is in decline.
In fact, the U.S. is well situated to be the crossroads nation. It is well situated to be the center of global networks and to nurture the right
kinds of networks. Building that America means doing everything possible to thicken connections: finance research to attract scientists;
improve infrastructure to ease travel; fix immigration to funnel talent; reform taxes to attract superstars; make study abroad a rite of
passage for college students; take advantage of the millions of veterans who have served overseas.
The nation with the thickest and most expansive networks will define the age. There's no reason to be pessimistic about that.","['America', 'America', 'Ukraine', 'Kenya', 'Paris', 'Germany', 'America', 'U.S.', 'United', 'States', 'America', 'America', 'America', 'China', 'India', 'U.S.', 'America']"

House Democrats Plan Schedule
for Lame-Duck Session
By Alan K Ota, CQ Staff
House Democratic leaders on Wednesday outlined a schedule for the
lame-duck session that would have lawmakers in town for at least two
weeks in November and into early December.
Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., assistant to Speaker Nancy Pelosi, said in an
interview after a conference call among Democratic leaders that
lawmakers were likely to work through next week, take a week off for the
Thanksgiving recess, and return for a second — and, for now, final —
week from Nov. 29 to Dec. 3.
Van Hollen, who is poised to take over next year as the top Democrat on
the Budget Committee, said he was unsure how Democrats would resolve
disputes over unfinished business such as tax cuts that are set to expire
Dec. 31 and funding for federal programs beyond the stopgap spending
measure (PL 111-242) that expires Dec. 3.
""We simply identified some of the issues that are out there,"" Van Hollen
said of the private leadership chat. ""Obviously, the big issue is how we
deal with various tax issues. And then there's the issue of an omnibus
[spending bill] versus a continuing resolution. There are a lot of other
potential issues. We're going to try to get the nutrition bill.""
He was referring to ongoing talks over a possible extension of expiring
provisions of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts (PL 107-16, PL 108-27), the
debate over whether to move an omnibus spending bill for fiscal 2011 or
another temporary spending measure, and a stalled child nutrition bill (HR
5504).
Van Hollen said that Pelosi, D-Calif., did not bring up the issue of the
tough caucus race for minority whip — the second-ranking Democrat in
the next Congress — between Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland and James E.
Clyburn of South Carolina. Both men were on the telephone call, Van
Hollen said, but the issue did not come up.
Democratic aides said Pelosi has encouraged both men to reach a
settlement to avert the potentially bloody intraparty fight. ""That wasn't
part of the discussion,"" Van Hollen said.","['D-Md.', 'PL', 'D-Calif.', 'Maryland', 'South', 'Carolina']"

Catty Carla Bruni lifts lid on Michelle Obama's
'hellish' job
By Peter Allen and Michael Seamark
Last updated at 1:26 AM on 16th September 2010
Michelle Obama thinks being America's First Lady is 'hell', Carla Bruni reveals today in a wildly indiscreet new book.
Miss Bruni reveals that Mrs Obama replied when asked about her position as the U.S. president's wife: 'Don't ask! It's
hell. I can't stand it!'
Details of the private conversation, which took place at the White House during an official visit by Nicolas Sarkozy last
March, emer ed in Carla And The Ambitious, a book written in collaboration with Miss Bruni.
No secrets: Michelle Obama, left, and Carla Bruni last year. Bruni made the revelations about the U.S. First Lady's
feelings in a wildly indiscreet new book
In it, she says one term as French president `will be enough' for her husband and suggests he might take tips from his
friend Tony Blair: Why not start making money?'

According to a friend quoted in the book, the Sarkozys have been 'impressed and inspired' by Mr Blair's fortune built up
since he left Downing Street.
Miss Bruni also takes a thinly veiled swipe at Princess Diana when talking about a visit to an African hospital full of Aids
victims earlier this year.
She says she refused requests by French cameramen for a photograph of her carrying a baby in her arms 'like Lady Di',
adding: 'There's something obscene in promoting yourself when you are giving of yourself.'

In the book, the Italian model 42, accuses French government officials of trying to 'kill' her husband with too much work,
and claims Mr Sarkozy lets himself be 'bullied' into complying.
Comparing herself to other leaders' wives, Miss Bruni says: 'I'm so different. I was a model. I sing, and I want to continue
to sing. And on top of that you expect me to be subtle?' And she admits: 'I am a femme fatale, my dear.'
She also recounts a telephone row with Mr Sarkozy's ex-wife Cecilia, who warned her that Mr Sarkozy had 'not yet turned
a new page' after their marriage.
Miss Bruni replied: 'Not only has he turned a page but he's changed books altogether. And you are the only person on
earth not to have noticed it.'

Days of rage: the Tea Party & America's right
Blumenthal begin of the skype highlighting end of the skype highlighting, 17 September 2010
About the author
Max Blumenthal begin_of_the_skype_highlighting end_of_the_skype_highlighting is a journalist whose work is
published in the New York Times, the Daily Beast, the Nation, the Huffington Post, Salon, and other publications. He is
author of Republican Gomorrah: Inside the Movement that Shattered the Party (Basic/Nation Books, 2009). His website is

The rise of the Tea Party movement in the United States in the first twenty months of Barack Obama '5 presidency is
shaking the political establishment, a trend reinforced by the victories of its candidates in Republican Party primaries. But
where has the movement come from, and what is its inner life? Max Blumenthal
begin_of the_skype highlighting end of the_skype highlighting, author of ""Republican Gomorrah"", enters the heady
world of the Tea Party to unravel the mix of driven personalities, feverish rhetoric, toxic hatreds, and flirtation with violence
that fuel its sub-culture's insurgent activism.
""He will tell you that he wants a strong authority to take from him the crushing responsibility of thinking for himself. Since
the Republic is weak, he is led to break the law out of love for obedience. But is it really strong authority that he wishes?
In reality he demands rigorous order for others, and for himself disorder without responsibility"" - Jean-Paul Sartre, Anti-
Semite and Jew
I am not sure when I first detected the noxious fumes that would envelop the conservative movement in the Barack
Obama era. It might have been in April 2009, when I visited a series of gun shows in rural California and Nevada.
Perusing tables piled high with high-calibre semi-automatic weapons and chatting with anyone in my vicinity, I heard
urgent warnings of mass roundups, concentration-camps, and a socialist government in Washington. ""These people that
are purchasing these guns are people that are worried about what's going on in this country"", a gun dealer told me outside
a show in Reno. ""Good luck Obama"", a young gun enthusiast remarked to me. ""We outnumber him 100 to 1."" At this time,
the Tea Party movement had not even registered on the national media's radar.
In September 2009, I led a panel discussion at the University of California-Riverside about my book Republic Gomorrah
(Basic/Nation Books, 2009). Inside an auditorium filled with nearly 100 students and faculty, I sat alongside Jonathan
Walton, an African-American professor of religious studies and prolific writer, and Mark Takano, an erudite, openly gay
former Democratic congressional candidate and local community-college trustee. In the middle of our discussion, a dozen
college Republicans stormed the front of the stage with signs denouncing me as a ""left-wing hack"" while a hysterical
young man leaped from the crowd, blowing kisses mockingly at Takano while heckling Walton as a ""racist"". Afterward,
university police-officers insisted on escorting me to my ride after the right-wing heckler attempted to follow me as he
shouted threats.
Who was this stalker? Just a concerned citizen worried about taxes? His name was Ryan Sorba and he was an operative
of a heavily funded national conservative youth outfit, the Intercollegiate Studies Institute. Besides founding dozens of
Republican youth groups across the country, Sorba has devoted an exceptional amount of energy to his interest in
homosexuals. His intellectual output consists of a tract titled The Born Gay Hoax, arguing that homosexuality is at once a
curable disease and a bogus trend manufactured by academic leftists. Adding to his credentials, Sorba has a history of
run-ins with the law, he explained when I called him about the order.
My encounter with this aggressive right-wing cadre seemed a strange, isolated event. But the hostility turned out to be
symptomatic of the intensifying campaign to delegitimise President Obama and his allies in Congress. The right's days of
rage were only beginning.
The constellation
Through his first year in office, Obama seemed oblivious to the threat of the far right. He campaigned against
partisanship, declaring that there were ""no red states"" and no ""conservative America"". Apparently, he thought it was
merely a contrivance or myth that there were people who rejected science, demonised gays, assailed minority and
women's rights - not that they genuinely believed in what they said. Speaking of changing Washington, Obama seemed to
think that the entire history of politics since the rise of Ronald Reagan and the right and their strategies of polarisation was
not deeply rooted but a superficial problem attributable to certain ""divisive"" personalities, easily wiped away with gestures
toward bipartisanship. His view of the parties was that they were simply mirror images sharing fundamental beliefs but
separated by ""partisans"". The skilled and devoted community organiser could bring them together.
Many of his supporters in the media, often partisans of political wars over the years, reinforced and amplified his
innocence, proclaiming he was the one at last who could ""bridge the partisan divide"". Andrew Sullivan, a disaffected
conservative who once called critics of George W Bush policies ""fifth columnists"" but now fervently supported Obama,
wrote that the new president was destined to become ""a liberal Reagan who can reunite America"". This optimism
pervaded the White House as the new president and his aides sought out Republicans willing to vote for his programmes.
After all, why couldn't we all just get along?
In his autobiographical book The Audacity of Hope, Obama highlighted a key component of his political strategy: ""I serve
as a blank screen on which people of vastly different political stripes project their own views."" Once he was elected,
conservatives concluded that they could reverse Obama's strength by transforming him into a human tableau for the most
fearsome images they could conjure (see ""Barack Obama, the fallen messiah"", 23 December 2009).
Obama's multiracial background was crucial in cultivating resentment among the shock-troops. Those who rejected
Obama's legitimacy to serve as president on the basis of his background gave birth to the ""Birther"" movement that sought
to challenge his citizenship. The movement's most visible figure, and therefore the most eccentric, was Orly Taitz, a
dentist and self-trained lawyer who had immigrated from the former Soviet republican of Moldova to Israel before settling
in the conservative bastion of Orange County, California. Convinced by claims on the far-right website WorldNetDaily that
Obama planned to create a ""civilian national security force"", Taitz told me she ""realised that Obama was another Stalin -
it's a cross between Stalinist USSR and Hitler's Germany.""
After becoming transfixed by online conspiracy theories claiming Obama's family had forged his birth-certificate in Hawaii,
Taitz snapped into action. She filed a lawsuit in November 2008 with California's secretary of state Debra Bowen
demanding an investigation into Obama's eligibility to serve as president. Taitz's plaintiff in the case was Wiley Drake, an
Orange County radio-preacher and former second vice-president of the Southern Baptist Convention who once publicly
prayed for Obama's death. While her lawsuit went nowhere, and subsequent suits earned her angry rebukes from judges,
Taitz became an instant media sensation, delivering heavily accented screeds against Obama before friendly interviewers
from Sean Hannity to CNN's Lou Dobbs (the latter, described by Taitz as her ""greatest supporter"", was eventually fired as
an indirect result of his hosting of her).
In March 2009, the Texas Representative Randy Neugebauer signed on to a Birther bill proposing that future presidential
candidates must prove their citizenship before becoming eligible to campaign. The Birther movement had found its voice
in government and made an indelible impact on the Republican grassroots. By June 2009, 28% of Republican
respondents to a Kos/Research 2000 poll said they thought Obama wasn't born in the United States, while 30% ""weren't
sure"". ""Obama should be in the Big House"", Taitz shrieked to me, ""not the White House!""
When Obama announced healthcare reform as the first major initiative of his administration, the conservative movement
activated a campaign of demonisation - transformational politics - designed to turn Obama into the ""Other"", making him
seem as unfamiliar, and therefore as threatening, as possible. When the president urged the Congress to deliver a
healthcare-reform bill in 2009, the right staged a living theatre of political hatred which turned Obama's dream of
bipartisanship into a nightmarish version of Peter Weiss's MaraVSade. On 12 September 2009, tens of thousands of far-
right activists belonging to a loose confederation of anti-government groups called the Tea Party Patriots converged on
Washington's National Mall for a giant protest against the Obama healthcare plan. The date was significant: Fox News's
top-ranked talk-show host Glenn Beck had declared the birth of the ""9-12 Project"" to restore the sense of unity (and siege
mentality) that Americans experienced on 11 September 2001. But this time, Obama - not Osama - was the enemy.
While covering the rally, I witnessed sign after sign declaring Obama a greater danger to America's security than al-Qaida;
demonstrators held images that juxtaposed Obama's face with images of evildoers from Hitler to Pol Pot to Bin Laden;
others carried signs questioning Obama's status as a United States citizen. ""We can fight al-Qaida, we can't kill Obama"",
said an aging demonstrator. Another told me, ""Obama is the biggest Nazi in the world"", pointing to placards he had
fashioned depicting Obama and House of Representatives' majority leader Nancy Pelosi in SS outfits. According to
another activist, Obama's agenda was similar to Hitler's: ""Hitler took over the banking industry, did he not? And Hitler had
his own personal secret service police. [The community-organising group] Acorn is an extension of that.""
The seemingly incongruous Tea Party propaganda recalled signs waved by right-wing Jewish settlers during rallies
against Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin and his support of the peace process, portraying him as an SS officer and as
the French collaborator Marshall Petain. In 1995, amid this provocative atmosphere, a young right-wing Jewish zealot
assassinated Rabin. The Israeli tragedy was a cautionary example of targeted hatred leading to violence.
Members of the Tea Party ""Patriots"" did not seem to care that their rhetoric was irrational, or that comparing Obama to
Hitler and Stalin was contradictory and obviously hyperbolic. Their motives were entirely negative. By purging government
of the multicultural evil that had seized power through illicit means (several activists told me they believed Acorn helped
Obama steal the election), they were convinced that a mythical golden American yesteryear would return. They had no
interest in building anything new or even articulating an agenda, much less discussing the merits of policies. The Tea
Party's primary concern was cultural purification - freedom from, not freedom to. Against the dark image of the president
and his liberal allies, Tea Party activists defined themselves as the children of light. The racial subtext was always
transparent.
The Tea Party's strategy rested on a guerrilla campaign of chaos and sabotage designed not only to intimidate Democrats
but also to disorient independent voters who might have supported healthcare reform. The Tea Paters were convinced
this would be an easy feat, since they believed the majority of the country was on their side - that they represented the
""real America"". At the 9-12 rally Matt Kibbe, one of the march organisers, told the crowd that ABC News was reporting
that 1 million to 1.5 million people were in attendance; ABC denied this, saying ""ABCNews.com reported an approximate
figure of 60,000 to 70,000 protesters."" Then one Dick Armey led the crowd in a chant of ""Freedom works! Freedom
works!"" Unknown to most of the Tea Paters, they were intoning the name of a corporate-funded Beltway advocacy-
group, not the battle-cry of Mel Gibson's version of William Wallace in Bra veheart.
Indeed, contrary to its image as a grassroots movement mobilised to stifle the machinations of Washington elites, the Tea
Party movement was the creation of a constellation of industry-funded conservative groups with close Republican ties.
The movement's leading puppet-master was the same Dick Armey, who directed resources and talking-points to the Tea
Party ""Patriots"" from his Washington-based advocacy group, FreedomWorks. Among the corporate clients of Armey's
lobbying firm, which he was forced to leave as a result of his involvement in the Tea Parties, was the pharmaceutical giant
Bristol Myers Squibb, a company with a clear interest in defeating healthcare reform. (Armey's other ""real American""
clients included the Marxist terror-cult, the People's Mojahedin of Iran, which received funding and assistance from
Saddam Hussein in order to launch terrorist strikes throughout the 1990s against Iranian civilian targets.) Armey collected
a consulting fee of $250,000 directly from FreedomWorks and $300,000 from allied astroturf front groups. FreedomWorks
paid out much of its money to an assortment of Republican political consultants.
The rumour
If Dick Armey was the Tea Party king, Sarah Palin was eager to be crowned the Tea Party queen. Just days after
Obama's inauguration, Palin abruptly quit her job as Alaskan governor to vie for the honour. Palin's motives for quitting
became clear when she inked a lucrative deal to write her political memoir Going Rogue, signed on as a regular
contributor to Fox News, and received $1 million an episode for a reality-show on cable television, ""Sarah Palin's Alaska"".
Palin's book-tour, which sent her through Middle America in a luxuriously outfitted bus, resembled both a presidential
campaign and a travelling carnival.
Whether or not Palin intends to run for president, her growing media presence has magnified her influence within the
Republican Party. Yet the ever-expanding Palin phenomenon was greeted with hostility by Republican politicos
desperately seeking to expand the party's base after the drubbing in 2008. Steve Schmidt, formerly John McCain's
campaign manager in the doomed presidential campaign of 2008, warned that Palin's nomination in 2012 would be
""catastrophic"" for the GOP. His doomsday prediction was backed by an Gallup poll in October 2009 revealing her as one
of the most polarising and unpopular political figures in the country with a disapproval rating of over 50%. Unfortunately for
Schmidt and other party pragmatists, those who approve of Palin represent the heartbeat of the Republican Party, its
most fervent activists, and cannot be dissuaded from following her, even if she is leading the party off a cliff.
A special congressional election in New York's heavily Republican 23rd district in November 2009 was the first major test
of Palin's power. Along with a parade of nationally recognised conservatives, Palin endorsed Doug Hoffman, an unknown
far-right third-party candidate closely allied with the Tea Party - in the process helping to force a popular moderate
Republican politician, Dede Scozzafava, from the race. In the end, Palin's ideological purge in upstate New York led to an
improbable Democratic victory, the first in that district in more than 100 years. After the disaster Palin and her allies
claimed victory, insisting they had at least hastened the purge of ideologically impure Republicans from the party. She
went on to endorse Rand Paul, the son of right-wing libertarian Representative Ron Paul and a candidate in Kentucky's
GOP senatorial primary; meanwhile George W Bush's vice-president Dick Cheney went out of his way to endorse Rand's
regular Republican opponent, Trey Grayson, the Kentucky secretary of state.
The self-described ""hardcore pro-lifer"" Palin followed the Tea Party script of avoiding social issues like abortion and gay
marriage in order to obscure the large presence of the Christian right within the movement's ranks, recasting herself
accordingly as a libertarian concerned primarily with issues of ""economic freedom"". She claimed the Democratic ""cap-
and-trade"" plan to limit carbon-emissions would harm the livelihood of blue-collar workers, and she assailed healthcare
reform as a Trojan horse for ""socialism"" (though she admitted her family ""used to hustle over the border"" to take
advantage of Canada's single-payer healthcare system). But no Palin attack had as much effect as the one she blasted
out on her Facebook page claiming the Obama healthcare plan included a provision for ""death panels"" that would
recommend euthanasia for severely ill patients like her Down syndrome-afflicted son, Trig. With the click of a button, Palin
transformed the tone of the healthcare debate from rancorous to poisonous.
The source of Palin's ""death panels"" smear was a practiced propagandist, former New York's lieutenant governor Betsy
McCaughey. When Bill Clinton introduced healthcare reform during his first term as president, McCaughey falsely claimed
in an article published in the New Republic that the plan would force consumers to drop their private plans and buy into
the government's programme (the article, widely circulated by Republicans, would go on to win a National Magazine
Award, only to be retracted years later by the New Republic's editors). Now she was back in the spotlight, pushing a
rumour that would be voted by the non-partisan fact-checking website Politifact.com as ""the lie of 2009"". McCaughey's
latest innuendo was boosted by the cult of political crank Lyndon LaRouche, which mobilised to push the rumour into the
mainstream.
In June 2009, one of LaRouche's top lieutenants publicly confronted Ezekiel Emanuel, the National Institute of Health's
chief bioethicist and brother of White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel, accusing him of seeking to reintroduce Hitler's
T-4 programme to kill the handicapped through healthcare reform. ""President Obama has put in place a reform apparatus
reviving the euthanasia of Hitler Germany in 1939, that began the genocide there"", LaRouche staffer Anton Chaitkin
charged. Soon, LaRouche's followers were on street corners around the country with posters depicting Obama with a
Hitler moustache. At a townhall forum on healthcare reform hosted by Barney Frank, a Democratic Representative, a
LaRouche follower waved one of the Obama-as-Hitler posters and demanded: ""Why do you continue to support a Nazi
policy, as Obama has expressly supported this policy?""
Two months later, after Palin whispered the rumour on Facebook, prominent conservatives from former House speaker
Newt Gingrich to ranking Senate finance-committee member Charles Grassley, parroted her claims before audiences of
indignant Tea Paters. Not to be outdone, Glenn Beck devoted an extended rant on his show to the reality of death
panels. Beck, echoing the LaRouche cultists, accused Ezekiel Emanuel of ""the devaluing of human life, putting a price on
each individual."" He thundered, ""The death panel is not a firing-squad. Rationing is inevitable and they know it!""
The death-panel rumour served a variety of functions, all useful to the movement, but not necessarily to the Republican
Party. Most importantly, the rumour resonated both with hard-core libertarians who resented the very existence of the
federal government and Christian right activists who viewed the legalisation of abortion as a slippery-slope to government-
sponsored euthanasia. The hysteria it engendered helped repair the rift exposed by the Terri Schiavo charade in 2005,
when the evangelical conservative James Dobson publicly clashed with Armey, the libertarian leader, over the right of the
government to interfere in a private family matter of life and death.
The enemy
The slurring of Obama as a sort of sleeper-agent crypto-Muslim helped bring the neo-conservatives back into the fray.
The new neocon generation was led by Dick Cheney's daughter, Liz, who founded an anti-Obama advocacy group, Keep
America Safe, by leveraging donations from pro-Israel sources. Asked by CNN's Larry King about the Birther movement
that was challenging Obama's status as an American citizen, Liz Cheney remarked: ""One of the reasons you see people
so concerned about this is people are uncomfortable with having for the first time ever, I think, a president who seems so
reluctant to defend the nation overseas."" With the libertarians, Christian right, and the neocons seated around the same
table, united in resentment of the alien president, the conservative movement was whole again.
The experiments in ""terror-management theory"" developed by three professors of psychology (Sheldon Solomon of
Skidmore College, Jeff Greenberg of the University of Arizona, and Tom Pyszczynski of the University of Colorado) have
demonstrated the connection between fear of death and intensification of conservative attitudes. The findings help explain
the effectiveness of the death-panel rumour and insinuations by conservative figures that Obama was not truly American
and somehow sympathetic to Islamic terrorists. Indeed, these seemingly irrational smears were guided by tactical
reasoning, calculated to agitate voters with constant reminders of their own mortality. Whether or not independent voters
responded, the rhetoric of death kept the Tea Party crowd in a persistent state of panic and rage, ensuring a standing
army ready to fan out to rallies and town halls at the first sign of liberal malfeasance.
Obama's first year in office was marked by more than raucous protests; there were several disturbing murders committed
by far-right extremists. In April 2009, a 22-year-old neo-Nazi wannabe named Richard Poplawsi mowed down a Swat
team of Pittsburgh cops, killing three. Poplawski's best friend told reporters the young killer ""grew angry recently over
fears Obama would outlaw guns."" Later it was discovered that Poplawski had posted a video-clip to a neo-Nazi website
portraying Fox's Glenn Beck contemplating the existence of concentration-camps. (After a characteristically thorough
investigation, Beck conceded they were not real.) On another occasion, the killer posted a video promoting Tea Party
rallies. A month after the Pittsburgh bloodbath, Scott Roeder, a supporter of the militant anti-abortion group Operation
Rescue, shot Dr George Tiller to death while he prayed at his church in Wichita, Kansas. Tiller was declared fair game by
the anti-abortion movement because of his role as Kansas's only late-term abortion provider. During at least twenty-eight
episodes of Bill O'Reilly's ""O'Reilly Factor,"" O'Reilly had referred to Tiller as ""Tiller the baby killer"", a criminal guilty of
""Nazi stuff."" ""I wouldn't want to be [Tiller] if there is a Judgment Day"", O'Reilly proclaimed.
In August 2009, a middle-aged professional named George Sodini walked into a health club in suburban Pittsburgh and
gunned down three women. The major media outlets explained Sodini's motives away by homing in on passages in his
online diaries describing his loneliness, inability to convince women to have sex with him, and descent into chronic
masturbation. Nearly every publication omitted or ignored a long deranged entry in which Sodini projected his sexual
frustration onto Obama, whom he seemed to view as a symbol of black male virility and predation.
The day after Obama's election victory, Sodini wrote: ""Good luck to Obama! He will be successful. The liberal media
LOVES him. Amerika has chosen The Black Man. Good! In light of this I got ideas outside of Obama's plans for the
economy and such. Here it is: Every black man should get a young white girl ... Kinda a reverse indentured servitude
thing. Every daddy know when he sends his little girl to college, she be ... real good. I saw it. 'Not my little girl', daddy
says! (Yeah right!!) Black dudes have thier [sic] choice of best white?? [ellipses in original].""
In another posting to an anti-Clinton forum in 1994, during the height of the Republicans' Whitewater investigation, Sodini
revealed that he had purchased a bumper-sticker reading, ""Stop Socialism, Impeach Clinton,"" from a National Review ad.
A year later, Sodini ranted on an anti-government militia site: ""I am convinced that more drastic action is required to bring
the country back to the Constitutional order that it was 200 years ago. I don't think any group of political leaders will
achieve this for us."" Whether or not Sodini's murder-spree was motivated by his political passions, he was pathologically
death-driven and fixated on the phantasmagoria of right-wing imagery. In his final diary entry, Sodini proclaimed: ""Death
lives!""
The bible
More than any other media figure of the Obama era, Glenn Beck encouraged the campaign of racial demonisation and
conspiracy that consumed the Tea Party ""Patriots"". During a broadcast of ""Fox and Friends"", Beck opined that Obama
""has exposed himself over and over and over again as a guy who has a deep-seated hatred for white people, or the white
culture."" As evidence, Beck pointed to White House green-jobs czar Van Jones, an African-American former community
organiser who was eventually forced to resign as a direct result of Beck's crusade. From there, Beck targeted another
black Obama adviser, Valerie Jarrett, highlighting her ties to Acorn while upholding her and Jones as evidence of
Obama's ""socialist"" agenda. In another broadcast, Beck played an audio clip of unidentified African-Americans referring to
""Obama money"" as they collected welfare-cheques in Detroit. Then he showed footage of members of a Kansas City-
based youth group practicing a step show, a traditional African-American group dance apparently unfamiliar enough to
Beck and his transfixed audience that he felt at liberty to claim the footage as evidence that ""Obama's SS"" was being
trained across inner-city America.
In September 2009, Beck relentlessly targeted Acorn, the rights new favourite hobgoblin, admitting that he intended to
use the poor people's advocacy group to distract his viewers from the healthcare debate. ""Trust me"", Beck said,
""Everybody now says they're going to be talking about healthcare. I don't think so."" (His statement was reminiscent of
Rush Limbaugh's scandal-mongering remark during the early Clinton administration: ""Whitewater is about healthcare."")
Beck promptly cued up a series of hidden-camera videos shot by conservative youth activists James O'Keefe and Hannah
Giles inside Acorn field offices.
In the videos, O'Keefe baited African-American staffers into making statements explaining that Giles, who claimed she
was a prostitute, could obtain low-income housing. O'Keefe edited in images of himself clad in an outlandish pimp
costume to create the impression that he was dressed that way during the meetings with Acorn; however, Giles later
admitted her partner had lied about wearing his costume to further incriminate Acorn. In the end, Acorn was exonerated of
all criminal wrongdoing.
In a separate incident O'Keefe was arrested and charged with a federal crime after he and several conservative pals
disguised themselves as telephone repairmen and attempted to wiretap phone-lines in the office of Senator Mary
Landrieu of Louisiana. Like Ryan Sorba, O'Keefe and his posse were movement cadres paid and directed by well-funded
conservative outfits; O'Keefe had been trained by the Leadership Institute, the right-wing youth group that nurtured
leading lights like Jack Abramoff, Karl Rove, Ralph Reed, and Jeff Gannon.
While O'Keefe and his buddies plea-bargained with prosecutors, Beck basked in his formula for success. His show earned
the highest ratings at Fox News, topping network franchises like O'Reilly and Sean Hannity. In the process, Beck's
opinions became firmly implanted in the nervous systems of Tea Party activists. ""Glenn Beck has taught us everything we
know"", a demonstrator at the 9-12 rally told me. ""He's opened our eyes to so much.""
But unlike the right-wing radio warhorses who helped usher in Newt Gingrich's Republican counter-revolution of 1994,
Beck was not an authentic product of the movement. When Rush Limbaugh first began dominating the AM airwaves,
Beck was mired in the world of mid-level commercial radio, delivering corny yarns about lesbians and celebrity trash in
hopes of becoming the next Howard Stern. By night, as he has tirelessly recounted, he medicated his anxiety with cocaine
and alcohol, destroying his first marriage in the process. ""We remember Glenn from the womanising, the drinking, the
drugs. Everybody who knew him at the time saw what a complete mess he was"", a shock- jock from Tampa, Florida, who
called himself Bubba the Love Sponge remarked to me during a broadcast of his nationally syndicated show.
Like Dusty Rhodes, the pseudo-populist demagogue of Elia Kazan's 1957 film, A Face in the Crowd, Beck was a self-
destructive drifter who might have been crumpled up with a bottle of Mad Dog 20/20 in an alleyway or been locked away
in a prison cell had fame not found him first. Beck was only able to stabilise his life when he made his escape from
freedom, marrying a conservative Mormon, converting to her religion, and transmuting his urge to abuse drugs into
conservative radio diatribes.
,When Beck first broke into television on CNN's Headline News Channel, he struggled to articulate a coherent political
worldview. If he distinguished himself from other big-time conservative hosts in any way, he did so through strained and
often snide attempts at humour, remnants of his failed radio career. Nevertheless, with help from his liberal agent,
Matthew Hiltzik, Beck snagged a primetime slot at Fox News in early 2009. Around this same time, Beck began promoting
the work of an arcane Mormon conspiracy-peddler named W Cleon Skousen, whom he described as his political lodestar.
Suddenly, Beck had something more to offer than irritable mental gestures.
Thanks to Beck's designation of Skousen's pseudo-historical tract The 5000 Year Leap as ""required reading"" on the
website of his 9-12 Project, and his promotion of the book on his show, the previously obscure Skousen became the
Hidden Imam of the Tea Party movement. By summer 2009, Skousen's Leap was among the top ten books on Amazon
and a fixture on literature tables at Tea Party gatherings. It went from selling a puny couple of thousand copies in 2007 to
selling over 200,000 copies in 2009. Just why the book generated such an instant appeal is difficult to understand. It is
little more than a slapdash of quotes from the Founding Fathers, often taken out of context and deliberately oversimplified,
to explain why America is the greatest nation in history. In the process, Skousen claims that church and state separation
is un-American, that ""coercive taxation"" is communist, and that marriage is the underpinning of a free society. Benjamin
Franklin, who wrote at length on the merits of ""amours"" with ""old women,"" and who famously solicited prostitutes and
fathered a son of out of wedlock, was the ultimate authority Skousen quoted on the importance of marriage.
Though Skousen claims the Founders as the world's foremost source of eternal wisdom, he buttressed his points with
fringe sources like the conspiracist Norman Dodd's screeds about the Illuminati. According to Skousen, Dodd claimed that
""powerful influences congregating in the United States"" like the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds had forced the United
States into the first world war. Skousen published Dodd's manifestoes in his obscure journal Freemen's Digest, which he
founded for the express purpose of propagating conspiracies.
Skousen's paranoid politics were an outgrowth of his participation in extreme anti-communist groups during the 1950s. He
boasted of a close friendship with then-FBI director J Edgar Hoover and said he provided him with research on communist
plots, claims disputed by FBI historians. (During a recent interview, Skousen's son, Paul, told me that contrary to rumours
of Hoover's cross-dressing and homosexual dalliances, he would set the top cop up on blind dates with live women.)
Skousen was fired from his job as Salt Lake City's police chief for, in the words of the city's conservative Mormon mayor,
""conduct[ing] his office as chief of police in exactly the same manner in which the communists operate their government.""
From there, Skousen sailed off to the far shores of the right-peddling conspiracy tracts like The Naked Communist, and
earning condemnation from his beloved FBI, which accused him in an internal memo of ""promoting [his] own anti-
communism for obvious financial purposes.""
Skousen's vocal support for the far-right John Birch Society's claim that communists controlled President Dwight
Eisenhower cost him the support of the corporate backers who had paid for his Red-bashing lecture tours. He went off the
radar for several years, returning during the late 1960s to accuse the Jewish Rothschild family of secretly bankrolling
everyone from Ho Chi Minh to the civil-rights movement. By the late 1970s, even the Church of Latter-Day Saints
distanced itself from Skousen and his conspiracy theories. His work fell through the margins and might have disappeared
entirely had Beck not revived it, turning The 5000 Year Leap into the bible of the Tea Party movement. Alexander Zaitchik
observed in his authoritative profile of Skousen on Salon that Skousen's renewed influence through Beck and the Tea
Party ""suggests that the modern base of the Republican Party is headed to a very strange place.""
The descent
Besides influencing Beck, Skousen's teachings inspired one of the Tea Party movement's most visible grassroots
celebrities, retired sheriff Richard Mack. I met Mack in February at a far-right rally just outside of Montgomery, Alabama.
On a makeshift stage towed into the middle of a rodeo arena by a pickup truck, Mack recalled with reverence his
mentorship by Skousen, who he said taught him everything he needed to know about the constitution. Mack urged his
spellbound audience to stockpile ammo and store food. ""If you control the food supply"", Mack warned, ""you control the
people. And that's the first step to slavery.""
Already a hero to conservatives for successfully suing the Clinton administration over the provision in the Brady Handgun
Violence Prevention Act requiring law enforcement to conduct criminal-background checks of gun purchasers, Mack
reemerged in the Obama era as the archetypal local lawman who vowed to resist the tyrannical federal government.
Along with a few dozen former and active military and law-enforcement personnel, Mack helped form a self-styled Tea
Party militia called the Oathkeepers. Galvanised by their fear of creeping socialism, the Oathkeepers solemnly swore to
refuse tyrannical federal orders such as cooperating with foreign troops and forcing Americans into concentration-camps.
Because the group's members trained for combat, the vow came with suggestion of armed resistance.
Besides Mack, the Oathkeepers attracted a coterie of militia-movement retreads into its ranks. The most well-established
figure was Mike Vanderboegh, a longtime militia fanatic who published a booklet in the mid-1990s entitled Strategy and
Tactics fora Militia Civil War, calling for sniper attacks on ""war criminals, secret policemen, rats."" With Obama in office,
Vandeboegh churned out anti-government screeds on right-wing blogs with renewed passion and supported his efforts by
cashing in the $1,300 in federal disability compensation he received each month.
For all the energy the far right exerted in its campaign to strangle Obama's agenda, it was a Democrat who posed the
greatest threat to the passage of healthcare reform. Representative Bart Stupak of Michigan had been in office since
1993, placing him among the senior leadership of the so-called centrist Blue Dog Democrats. When healthcare reform
was introduced in Congress, Stupak became the leader of an informal caucus of anti-abortion Democrats, making him the
de facto swing vote on the House version of the bill. By extension, Stupak was the point man in the campaign to ensure
that the bill would not allow federal funding for abortion for low-income women.
But after close consultation with leaders of the US Conference of Catholic Bishops, Stupak went a step further. He
introduced a draconian amendment to block women from paying for abortions from even their own private insurance
plans. The amendment, which passed the House but was shut down in the Senate, became a key sticking point in
healthcare negotiations. ""He's a big hero now in the pro-life community"", Deal Hudson - former Catholic issues adviser to
George W Bush - told me in November 2009. ""Thanks to him, this is the first time I can remember the pro-life Democrats
having any power.""
To the chagrin of the Republicans, Stupak entertained offers of compromise from the Democratic leadership. According to
Hudson, the Catholic bishops were keen to see healthcare reform pass, but only if the bill contained a clear provision
forbidding patients from spending federal money on abortion. Finally, in March 2010, after pressure from Nancy Pelosi,
Obama agreed to sign an executive order forbidding the federal funding of abortion. Stupak had been mollified. Now he
and his anti-abortion caucus pledged to deliver the swing votes the Democrats needed to pass the bill. As soon as reports
seeped out declaring the imminent passage of healthcare reform, major right-wing blogs like RedState.org churned out
virulent denunciations of Stupak, calling him a traitor and sellout. The blog comment sections filled up with dozens of
diatribes referring to Stupak in language previously reserved for Dr George Tiller: ""Bart the Baby-Killer.""
On 20 March 2010, thousands of Tea Party activists surrounded the Capitol's Longworth Building in expectation of
Obama's pep talk to the House Democrats and the healthcare vote. Democratic Representative John Lewis, a hero of the
civil-rights movement, and Representative Barney Frank, the first openly gay member of Congress, passed through the
crowd on their way inside the Capitol. ""Nigger!"" a demonstrator barked at Lewis. Another called Frank a ""faggot"", eliciting
laughter and cheers from nearby protesters. Meanwhile, as another African-American Democrat, Representative Emanuel
Cleaver, ascended the Capitol steps, a protester who had been screaming at Lewis and Frank spat on his face.
With the demonstration carried on into the night, cries of ""Kill the bill!"" drifted into calls for violence. ""I would gladly stand
with any of you men here and take these fascists down"", a man in camouflage battle-dress uniform proclaimed in front of
an amateur videographer, pointing toward the Capitol. ""You haven't heard the last of me!""
The next day, Republican members of Congress emerged from the Longworth Building to salute the Tea Paters. The
demonstrators cheered wildly for their proxies on the inside. Finally, after hours of impassioned speeches on the House
floor, the bill passed. But the drama was hardly over.
Republican Representative Joe Pitts, an anti-abortion Catholic who co-authored Stupak's original amendment, demanded
a motion to bring it back to the floor for a vote, a transparent exercise in grandstanding that was certain to fail. In
response, Stupak rushed to the podium with a stinging rebuke to Pitts and the Republicans. ""The motion to commit does
not support life"", Stupak declared. ""It is the Democrats who have stood up...."" Heckling from the Republican side
interrupted his statement. As Stupak looked around the House chamber, Representative Randy Neugebauer, a right-wing
Republican from Texas who openly supported the Birther movement, began shouting at him from the backbench, ""Baby
killer!"" Other Republicans joined in, parroting base insults.
While the Republicans sank their heads in defeat, some more militant devotees of the Tea Party movement called for a
right-wing Kristallnacht. ""If you wish to send a message that Pelosi and her party cannot fail to hear, break their windows"",
Vanderboegh of the Oathkeepers wrote on a far-right blog hours after the bill passed. ""Break them NOW. Break them and
run to break again."" Within three days, windows and doors at Democratic Party headquarters in New York, Kansas and
Arizona had been shattered.
Meanwhile, at least ten Democratic members of Congress reported receiving death threats. Images of nooses were faxed
to the offices of Stupak and James Clyburn, an African-American congressman from South Carolina. Representative
Anthony Weiner, an especially vocal proponent of healthcare reform, received a menacing letter filled with white powder.
The brother of Representative Tom Perriello, another healthcare supporter, had his home gas line deliberately sabotaged
after a local Tea Party organiser posted his address online (he had meant to post the congressman's) and encouraged
activists to ""drop by"" to express their anger about Perriello's recent vote. In Tucson, Arizona, the windows of Democratic
Representative Gabrielle Giffords' office were shattered by shots from a pellet gun. And a brick was thrown through the
window of Representative Louise Slaughter's office in New York as her voicemail filled with threats of impending sniper
attacks.
After the passage of the healthcare bill, the Tea Party floated into a grey zone between authoritarianism and anarchy.
Crusading to restore a holy social order, they promoted disorder. Claiming to protect democracy, they smashed windows
of elected representatives. Warning of death panels, they called in death threats. With the atmosphere of violence
thickening, Palin took to her Twitter account to issue a battle-cry: ""Don't Retreat, Instead-RELOAD!"" Thus concluded the
first phase of the Obama era that was to usher in a peaceable kingdom of bipartisanship.","['United', 'States', 'United', 'States', 'California', 'Nevada', 'Washington', 'Sorba', 'America', 'Washington', 'America', 'Moldova', 'Israel', 'Orange', 'County', 'California', 'USSR', 'Germany', 'Hawaii', 'California', 'Orange', 'County', 'Texas', 'United', 'States', 'Washington', 'National', 'Mall', 'America', 'United', 'States', 'America', 'Washington', 'FreedomWorks', 'FreedomWorks', 'Alaska', 'Middle', 'America', 'Palin', 'New', 'York', 'New', 'York', 'Kentucky', 'Canada', 'Palin', 'New', 'York', 'New', 'Republic', 'New', 'Republic', 'White', 'House', 'Hitler', 'Germany', 'Pittsburgh', 'Pittsburgh', 'Wichita', 'Kansas', 'Kansas', 'Pittsburgh', 'Detroit', 'Kansas', 'America', 'Louisiana', 'Tampa', 'Florida', 'Amazon', 'America', 'United', 'States', 'United', 'States', 'Salt', 'Lake', 'City', 'Montgomery', 'Alabama', 'Michigan', 'Hudson', 'Longworth', 'Building', 'Capitol', 'Capitol', 'Longworth', 'Building', 'Texas', 'New', 'York', 'Kansas', 'Arizona', 'South', 'Carolina', 'Tucson', 'Arizona', 'New', 'York']"

STATEMENT BY SECRETARY CLINTON
Release of Aung San Suu Kyl
Today I join with billions of people around the world to welcome the long-overdue release of Burmese democracy leader
and Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi from house arrest.
Aung San Suu Kyi has endured enormous personal sacrifice in her peaceful struggle to bring democracy and human
rights to Burma, including unjustified detention for most of the past twenty years. The Burmese regime has repeatedly
rejected her offers to engage in dialogue and work together, trying instead to silence and isolate her. Through it all,
Aung San Suu Kyi's commitment to the Burmese people has not wavered.
The United States calls on Burma's leaders to ensure that Aung San Suu Kyi's release is unconditional so that she may
travel, associate with her fellow citizens, express her views, and participate in political activities without restriction. They
should also immediately and unconditionally release all of Burma's 2,100 political prisoners.
We urge Burma's leaders to break from their repressive policies and begin an inclusive dialogue with Aung San Suu Kyi
and other democratic and ethnic leaders towards national reconciliation and a more peaceful, prosperous, and
democratic future.

Moments of imperial and economic decline
-- according to a recent poll, 65% of
Americans now believe this country to be
""in a state of decline"" -- can also be periods
of cultishness, even of madness
incarnate. Such a mood now seems to be
spreading through the United States. It's
not so surprising, really: Since the attacks
of September 11, 2001, fear has
been iniiecttcl into this ""homeland"" like a
drug and a penumbia of official secrecy has
settled over the land in a way that makes
the secrecy of the Cold War years (when
this country faced a superpower, not a
ragtag set offihadis, guerrillas, and
terrorists) seem like an era of sunshine.
In an atmosphere of swirling fears and
hysteria amid declining living conditions,
""explanations"" that at other times might
have remained confined to tiny crews of
conspiracy-mongers can suddenly gain a
patina of plausibility and so traction. No
wonder then that, as hard times hit, as the
financial system seemed on the verge of
collapse, as unemployment soared and a
massive wave of home foreclosures swept
into view, increasing numbers of
Americans became prey to any wacky
explanation for our troubles, none more so
than the idea that Islam was somehow
responsible, that mosques and Islamic
centers meant for a sliver of a minority here
were capable of imposing anything, no less
a way of life on this country, or that Sharia
law (of all things) might somehow worm
its way into state teal systems, or that
YouTube was a hotbed of.terrorism worthy
of suppression, or... well, you name it.
Max Blumenthal, author of the bestselling
book Reptblican Gomorrah: Inside the
Movement Thai Shattered the Party, has
done the necessary legwork to""take us deep
into one of those crews of conspiracy-
mongers who, at another time, just about
no one would have paid much attention to,
but in twenty-first-century America have
gained a remarkable audience. They are a
chilling barometer of the changing weather

Hopefuls Behind the
Crusade
By Max Blumenthal
Nine years after 9/11,
hysteria about Muslims in
American life has gripped
the country. With it has
Gone an outburst of arson
attacks on mosques,
campaigns to stop their
construction, and the
branding of the Muslim-
American community,
overwhelmingly moderate,
as a hotbed of potential
terrorist recruits. The frenzy
has raged from rural
Tennessee to New York
City, while in Oklahoma,
voters even overwhelmingly
Approved a ballot measure
banning the implementation
of Sharia law in American
courts (not that such a
prospect existed). This
campaign of islamophobia
wounded President Oba.ma
politically, as one out of five
Americans have bought
into a sustained chorus of
false rumors about his secret
Muslim faith. And it may
have tainted views of
Muslims in general; an
August 2010 Pew Research
Center poll revealed that,
among Americans, the
favorability rating of
Muslims had dropped by 11
points since 2005.
Erupting so many years after
the September 11th trauma,
this spasm of anti-Muslim
bigotry might seem oddly
timed and unexpectedly
spontaneous. But think
again: it's the fruit of an
organized, long-term
campaign by a tight
confederation of right-Wing
activists and operatives who
first focused on
Isia.mophobia soon after the
September 11th attacks, but
only attained critical mass
during the Obama era. It
was then that embittered
conservative forces, voted
out of power in 2008, sought
with remarkable success to
leverage cultural resentment
into political and partisan
gain.
This network is obsessively
fixated on the supposed
spread of Muslim influence
in America. Its apparatus
spans continents, extending
from Tea Party activists here
to the European far right. It
brings together in common
cause right-wing ultra-
Zionists, Christian
evangelicals, and racist
British soccer hooligans. It
reflects an aggressively pro-
Israel sensibility, with its
key figures venerating the
Jewish state as a Middle
Eastern Fort Apache on the
front lines of the Global
War on Terror and urging
the U.S. and various
European powers to emulate
its heavy-handed methods.
Little of recent American
Jslamophobia (with a.strong
emphasis on the ""phobia"") is
sheer happenstance. Years
before Tea Party shock
troops massed for angry
protests outside the
proposed site of an Islamic
community center in lower
Manhattan, representatives
of the Israel lobby and the
Jewish-American
establishment launched a
campaign against pro-
Palestinian campus activism
that would prove a seedbed
for everything to come. That
campaign quickly -- and
perhaps predictably --
morphed into a series of
crusades against mosques
and islarilic schools which,
in turn, attracted an
assortment of shady but
exceptionally energetic
militants into the network's
ranks.
Besides providing the initial
energy for the islamophobic
crusade, conservative
elements from within the
pro-Israel lobby bankrolled
the network's apparatus,
enabling it to influence the
national debate. One
philanthropist in particular
has provided the
beneficence to propel the
campaign ahead. He is a
little-known Los Angeles-
area software security
entrepreneur named Aubrey
Chernick, who operates out
of a security consulting firm
blandly named the National
Center for Crisis and
Continuity Coordination. A
former trustee of the
Washington Institute for
Near East Policy, which has
served as a think tank for the
American Israeli Public
Affairs Committee
(AIPAC), a frontline
lobbying group for Israel,
Chernick is said to be worth
$750 million.
Chemick's fortune is puny
compared to that of the
billionaire Koch Brothers,
extraction industry titans
who fund Tea Party-related
groups like Americans for
Prosperity, and it is dwarfed
by the financial empire of
Haim Saban, the Israeli-
American media baron who
is one of the largest.-orivate
donors to the Democratic
party and recently matched
$9 million raised for the
Friends of the Israeli
Defense Forces in a single
night. However, by injecting
his money into a small but
influential constellation of
groups and individuals with
a narrow agenda. Chernick
has had a considerable
impact.
Through the Fairtmook
Foundation, a private entity
he and his wife Joyce
control, Chernick has
provided funding to groups
ranging from the Anti-
Defamation League (ADL)
and CAMERA, a right-
wing, pro-Israel, media-
watchdog outfit, to violent
Israeli settlers living on
Palestinian lands and figures
like the pseudo-academic
author Robert Spencer, who
is largely responsible for
popularizing conspiracy
theories about the coming
conquest of the West by
Muslim fanatics seeking to
establish a worldwide
caliphate. Together, these
groups spread hysteria about
Muslims into Middle
American communities
where immigrants from the
Middle East have recently
settled, and they watched
with glee as likely
Republican presidential
frontrunners from Mike
Huckabee to Sarah Palin
pmmoted their cause and
oarpe.ki their tropes.
Perhaps the only thing more
surprising than the
increasingly widespread
appeal of islamophobia is
that, just a few years ago,
the phenomenon was
confined to a few college
campuses and an inner city
neighborhood, and that it
seemed like a fleeting fad
that would soon pass from
the American political
landscape.
Birth of a Network
The fslamophobic crusade
was launched in earnest at
the peak of George W.
Bush's prestige when the
neoconservatives and their
allies were riding high. In
2003, three years after the
collapse of President Bill
Clinton's attempt to resolve
the Israeli-Palestinian issue
and in the immediate wake
of the invasion of Iraq, a
network of Jewish groups,
ranging from ADL and the.
American Jewish
Committee to AIPAC,
gathered to address what
they saw as a sudden rise in
pro-Palestinian activism on
college campuses
nationwide. That meeting
gave birth to the David
Project, a campus advocacy
group led by Charles Peters,
who had co-founded
CAMERA, one of the many
outfits bankrolled by
Chernick. With the help of
public relations
professionals,. Peters
ci a plan to ""take
back the campus by
influencing public opinion
through lectures. the
Internet, and coalitions,"" as
a memo produced at the
time by the consulting firm
McKinsey and Company
stated.
In 2004, after conferring
with Martin Kramer, a
fellow at the Washington
Institute for Near East
Policy, the pro-Israel think
tank Where Chernoff had
served as a trustee, Peters
produced a documentary
film that he called Columbia
""rbecornint., It was -filled
with claims from Jewish
students at Columbia
University claiming they
had endured intimidation
and insults from Arab
professors. The film
portrayed that New York
City school's Department of
Middle East and Asian
Languages and Cultures as a
hothouse of anti-Semitism.
In their complaints, the
students focused on one
figure in particular: Joseph
.vlassa.d, a Palestinian
professor of Middle East
studies. He was known for
his passionate advocacy of
the formation of a binational
state between Israel and
Palestine, as well as for his
strident criticism of what he
termed ""the racist character
of Israel."" The film
identified him as ""one of the
most dangerous intellectuals
on campus,"" while he was
featured as a crucial villain
in The Professors: The 101
Most Dangerous Academics
in America, a book by the
(Chemick-•funded)
neoconservative activist
David Horowitz. As
Massad was seeking tenure
at the time, he was
especially vulnerable to this
sort of wholesale assault.
When the controversy over
Massad's views intensified,
Congressman Anthony
Weiner, a liberal New York
Democrat who pqee
:lescri himself as a
representative of ""the ZOA
[Zionist Organization of
America] wing of the
Democratic Party,""
demanded that Columbia
President Lee Bollinger,
a
renowned First Amendment
scholar, fire the professor.
Bollinger responded by
issuing uncharacteristically
defensive statements about
the ""limited"" nature of
academic freedom.
In the end, however, none of
the charges stuck. Indeed,
the testimonies in the David
Project film were eventually
either discredited or never
corroborated. In 2009,
Massad earned tenure after
winning Columbia's
prestigious Lionel Trilling
Award for excellence in
scholarship.
Having demonstrated its
ability to intimidate faculty
members and even powerful
university administrators,
however, Kramer claimed a
moral victory in the name of
his project, boasting to the
press that ""this is a turning
point."" While the David
Project subsequently
fostered chapters on
campuses nationwide, its
director set out on a
different path -- initially,
into the streets of Boston in
2004 to oppose the
construction of the Islamic
Society of Boston Cultural
Center.
For nearly 15 years, the
Islamic Society of Boston
had sought to build the
center in the heart of
Roxbury, the city's largest
black neighborhood, to
serve its sizable Muslim
population. With
endorsements from Mayor
Thomas Menino and leading
Massachusetts lawmakers,
the mosque's construction
seemed like a fait accompli -
- until, that is, the Rupert
Murdoch-owned Boston
Herald and his local Fox
News affiliate snapped into
action. Boston Globe
columnist Jeff Jacoby also
chimed in with a series of
reports claiming the center's
plans were evidence of a
Saudi Arabian plot to bolster
the influence of radical
Islam in the United States,
and possibly even to train
underground terror cells.
It was at this point that the
David Project entered the
fray, convening elements of
the local pro-Israel
community in the Boston
area to seek strategies to
torpedo the project.
According to emqiis
obtained by the Islamic
Society's lawyers in a
lawsuit against the David
Project, the organizers
settled on a campaign of
years of nuisance lawsuits,
along with accusations that
the center had received
foreign finding from ""the
Wahhabi movement in
Saudi Arabia or... the
Moslem Brotherhood.""
In response, a grassroots
coalition of liberal Jews
initiat4d inter-faith efforts
aimed at ending a
controversy that had
essentially been
manufactured out of thin air
and was corroding relations
between the Jewish and

city. Peters would not,
however, relent. 'We are
more concerned now than
we have ever been about a
Saudi influence of local
mosques,"" he ,apounced at
a suburban Boston
synagogue in 2007.
After paying out millions of
dollars in legal bills and
enduring countless smears,
the Islamic Society of
Boston completed the
construction of its
community center in 2008.
Meanwhile, not surprisingly,
nothing came of the David
Project's dark warnings. As
Boston-area National Public
Radio reporter Philip Martin
reflected in September 2010,
""The horror stories that
preceded [the center's]
development seem shrill and
histrionic in retrospect.""
The Network Expands
This second failed campaign
was, in the end, more about
movement building than
success, no less national
security. The local crusade
established an effective
blueprint for generating
hysteria against the
establishment of Islamic
centers and mosques across
the country, while
galvanizing a cast of
characters who would form
an anti-Muslim network
which would gain attention
and success in the years to
come.
In 2007, these figures
coalesced into a proto-
movement that launched a
new crusade, this time
targeting. the Khalil Gibran
International Academy, a
secular Arabic-English
elementary school in
Brooklyn, New York.
Calling their ad hoc pressure
group, Stop the Madrassah
madrassah being simply
the Arab word for ""school"" -
- the coalition's activists
included an array of
previously unknown zealots
who made no attempt to
disguise their extreme views
when it came to Islam as a
religion, as well as Muslims
in America. Their stated
goal was to challenge the
school's establishment on
the basis of its violation of
the church-state separation
in the U.S.
Constitution. The true aim
of the coalition, however,
was transparent: to pressure
the city's leadership to adopt
an antagonistic posture
towards the local Muslim
community.
The activists zeroed in on
the school's principal,
Debbie Almontaser, a
veteran educator of Yemeni
descent, and baselessly
.branded her ""a jihadist"" as
well as a 9/11 denier. They
also accused her of-- as
Pamela Geller, a far-right
blogger just then gaining
prominence put it,
""whitewash[ing] the
genocide against the
Jews."" Daniel Pipes, a
neoconservative academic
previously active in the
campaigns against Joseph
Massad and the Boston
Islamic center (and whose
pro-Likud think tank,
Middle East .Forum, has
received $150,000 from
Chernick) Jamed the
school should not go ahead
because ""Arabic-language
instruction is inevitably
laden with Pan-Arabist and
Islamist baggage."" As the
campaign reached a fever
pitch, Almontaser reported
that members of the
coalition were actually
stallsinQ her wherever she
went.
Given what Columbia
Journalism School professor
and former New York Times
reporter Samuel Freedman
called ""her clear, public
record of interfaith activism
and outreach,"" including
work with the New York
Police Department and the
Anti-Defamation League
after the September 11th
attacks, the assault on
.Almontaser seemed little
short of bizarre -- until her
assailants discovered a
photograph of a T-shirt
produced by AWAAM, a
local Arab feminist
organization, that read
""Intifada NYC."" As it
turned out, AWAAM
sometimes shared office
space with a Yemeni-
American association on
which Almontaser served as
a board member. Though
the connection seemed like a
stretch, it promoted the line
of attack the Stop the
Madrassah coalition had
been seeking.
Having found a way to
wedge the emotional issue
of the Israel-Palestine
conflict into a. previously
New York-centered
campaign, the school's
opponents next gained a
platform at the Murdoch-
owned New York Post,
where reporters Chuck
Bennett and Jana Winter
claimed her T-shirt was
""apparently a call for a
Gaza-style uprising in the
Big Apple."" While
Almontaser attempted to
explain to the Post's
reporters that she rejected
terrorism„ the Anti-
Defamation League chimed.
in on cue. ADL spokesman
Oren Segal told the Post:
""The T-shirt is a reflection
of a movement that
increasingly lauds violence
against Israelis instead of
rejecting it. That is
disturbing.""
Before any Qassam rockets
could be launched from
Almontaser's school, her
former ally New York
Mayor Michael Bloomberg
caved to the growing
pressure and threatened to
shut down the school,
prompting her to resign. A
Jewish principal who spoke
no Arabic replaced
Almontaser, who later filed
a lawsuit against the city for
breaching her free speech
rights. In 2010, the Equal
Employment Opportunity
Commission ui that New
York's Department of
Education had ""succumbed
to the very bias that the
creation of the school was
intended to dispel"" by firing
Almontaser and urged it pay
her $300,000 in damages.
The commission also
concluded that the Post had
quoted her misleadingly.
Though it failed to stop the
establishment of the Khalil
Gibran Academy,•the
burg:eoning anti-M sliin
movement succeeded in
forcing city leaders to bend
to its will, and having
learned just how to do that,
then moved on in search of
more high-profile targets.
As the ,New York Times
s!..t_..at the time, ""The
fight against the school...
was only an early skirmish
in a broader, national
struggle.""
s a battle that has really
just begun."" Pipes told the
Times.
From Scam to Publicity
Coup
Pipes couldn't have been
more on the mark. In late
2009, the Isiamophobes
sprang into action again
when the Cordoba Initiative,
a non-profit Muslim group
headed by Feisai Abdul
Rauf, an exceedingly
moderate Sufi Muslim imam
who regularly
lepic,,etiting the
United States at the behest
of the State Department,
announced that it was going
to build a community center
in downtown New ""NCork
City. With the help of
investors, Raufs Cordoba
Initiative purchased space
two blocks from Ground
Zero in Manhattan. The
space was to contain a
prayer area as part of a large
community center that
would be open to everyone
in the neighborhood.
None of these facts mattered
to Pamela Geller. Thanks to
constant prodding at her
Nog, Atlas Shrugged. Geller
made Cordoba's
construction plans a national
issue, provokino fervent
calls faml conservatives to
protect the ""hallowed
ground"" of 9/11 from
creeping Sharia. (That the
""mosque"" would have been
out of sight of Ground Zero
and that the neighborhood
was, in fact.
everything from strip clubs
to fast-food joints didn't
matter.) Geller's activism
against Cordoba House
earned the 52-year-old full-
time blogger the attention
she apparently craved.,
including a • 1 in
the Neu, York ThIleS and
frequent cable news spots,
esoeciallv, of course, on Fox
News.
Mainstream reporters tended
to focus on Geller's bizarre
stunts. She posted a video
of herself
in a string bikini on a Fort
Lauderdale beach, for
instance, while ranting about
""left-tards"" and ""Nazi
Hezbollah."" Her gall for
boycotting Campbell's Soup
because the company
offered halal -- approved
under Islamic law (as kosher
food is under Jewish law) --
versions of its products got
her much attention, as did
her .cron-lotior of a screed
claiming that President
Barack Obama was the
illegitimate lovechild of
Malcolm X.
Geller had never earned a
living as a journalist. She
supported herself with
millions of dollars in a
divorce settlement and life
insurance money from her
ex-husband. He died in
2008, a year after being
for an alleged $1.3
million scam he was
accused of-running out of a
car dealership he co-owned
with Geller. Independently
wealthy and with time on
her hands, Geller proved
able indeed when it came to
exploiting her strange media
stardom to in.cite the already
organized political network
of islamophobes to intensify
their crusade.
She also benefited from
close alliances with leading
islamophobes from Europe.
Among Ocher's allies was
Andrew Gravers, a Danish
activist who formed the
group Stop the
Islamicization of Europe,
and :.1a.-ye it the unusually
blunt motto: ""Racism is the
lowest form of human
stupidity, but Islamophobia
is the height of common
sense."" Gravers' group
inspired Geller's own U.S.-
based outfit, Stop the
Islamicization of America,
which she formed with her
friend Robert Spencer, a
pseudo-scholar whose
bestselling books, including
The Truth About
Muhammad, Founder of the
World's Most Intolerant
Religion, prompted former
advisor to President Richard
Nixon and Muslim activist
Robert Crane to ca/1
""the principal leader... in
the new academic .field of
Muslim bashing.""
(According to the website
almost $1 million
in donations from Chernick
has been steered to
Spencer's Jihad Watch
group through David
Horowitz's Freedom
Center.)
Perfect sources for
Republican political figures
in search of the next hot-
button cause, their rhetoric
found its way into the
talking points of Newt
Gingrich and Sarah Patin as
they propelled the crusade
against Cordoba House into
the national spotlight.
Gingrich soon pared the
community center to a Nazi
sign next to the Holocaust
Memorial Museum, while
Patin called it ""a stab in the
heart"" of ""the Heartland.""
Meanwhile, Tea Party
candidates like Republican
Ilario Pantano, an Iraq war
veteran who killed two
unarmed Iraqi civilians,
shooting them 60 times -- he
even stopped to reload
made their opppsition to
Cordoba House the
centerpiece of midterm
congressional campaigns
conducted hundreds of miles
from Ground Zero.
Geller's campaign against
""the mosque at Ground
Zero"" gained an unexpected
assist and a veneer of
legitimacy from established
Jewish leaders like Anti-
Defamation League
National Director Abraham
Foxman. ""Survivors of the
Holocaust are entitled to
feelings that are irrational,""
he et.:narked to the New
York Times. Comparing the
bereaved family members of
9-1 1 victims to Holocaust
survivors, Foxman insisted,
""Their anguish entitles them
to positions that others
would categorize as
irrational or bigoted.""
Soon enough, David Harris,
director of the (Chernick-
funded) American Jewish
Committee, was demanding
that Cordoba's leaders be
compelled to reveal their
""true attitudes"" about
Palestinian militant groups
before construction on the
center was initiated. Rabbi
Marvin Hier of the Simon
Wiesenthal Center of Los
Angeles, another major
Jewish group, insisted it
would be ""insensitive"" for
Cordoba to build near ""a
cemetery,"" though his
organization had recently
been granted permission
from the municipality of
Jerusalem to build a
""museum of tolerance"" to be
called The Center for
Human Dignity directly on
top of the Mamilla
Cemetery, a Muslim
Graveyard that contained
thousands of grave sites
dating back 1,200 years.
Inspiration from Israel
It was evident from the
involvement of figures like
Gravers that the
Islamophobic network in the
United States represented a
trans-Atlantic expansion of
simmering resentment in
Europe. There, the far-right
was storming to victories in
parliamentary elections
across the continent in part
by appealing to the
simmering anti-Muslim
sentiments of voters in rural
and working-class
communities. The extent of
the collaboration between
European and American
Islamophobes has only
continued to grow with
Geller, Spencer, and even
Gingrich standing beside
Europe's most prominent
anti-Muslim figure, Dutch
pad iamentarian Geed
Wilders, at a rally against
Cordoba House. In the
meantime. Geller was
issuing statements of
sunport for the Emdish
Defense League, a band of
uoorlstruc[ed riec)-Nazis
and former members of the
whites-only British National
Party who intimidate
Muslims in the streets of
cities like Birmingham and
London.
In addition, the trans-
Atlantic Islamophobic
crusade has stretched into
Israel, a country that has
come to symbolize the
network's fight against the
Muslim menace. As Geller
told the New York Times'
Alan Feuer, Israel is ""a very
good guide because, like I
said, in the war between the
civilized man and the
savage, you side with the
civilized man.""
EDL members regularly
wave Israeli flags at their
rallies, while Wilders claims
to have formed his views
about Muslims during the
time he worked on an Israeli
cooperative farm in the
1980s. He has, he says,
visited the country more
than 40 times since to meet
with rightist political allies
like Aryeh Eldad, a member
of the Israeli Knesset and
leader of the far right
Hatikvah faction of the
National Union Party. He
has called for forcibly
""transferring"" the
Palestinians living in Israel
and the occupied West Bank
to Jordan and Egypt. On
December 5th, for example,
Wilders traveled to Israel for
a 'ffrjend nieei,imr, with
Foreign Minister Avi2clor
Lieberman, then declared at
a press conference that
Israel should annex the West
Bank and set up a
Palestinian state in Jordan.
In the apocalyptic clash of
civilizations the global anti-
Muslim network has sought
to incite, tiny armed Jewish
settlements like Yitzar,
located on the hills above
the occupied Palestinian city
of Nablus, represent front-
line fortresses. Inside
Yitzar's state-funded
yeshiva, a rabbi named
Yitzhak Shapira has
instructed students in what
rules must be applied when
considering killing non-
Jews. Shapira summarized
his opinions in a widely
publicized book. Torat
HaMelech, or The King's
Torah. Claiming that non-
Jews are ""uncompassionate
by nature,"" Shapira cited
rabbinical texts to declare
that gentiles could be killed
in order to ""curb their evil
inclinations."" ""There is
justification,"" the rabbi
proclaimed, ""for killing
babies if it is clear that they
will grow up to harm us, and,
in such a situation they' may
be harmed deliberately, and
not only during combat with
adults.""
In 2006, the rabbi was
briefly held by Israeli police
for urging his supporters to
murder all Palestinians over
the age of 13. Two years
later, according to the Israeli
newspaper Ilaaretz, he
a rabbinical letter in
support of Israeli Jews who
had brutally assaulted two
Arab youths on the country's
Holocaust Remembrance
Day. That same year,
Shapira was arrested as a
suspect in helping
a rocket attack
against a Palestinian village
near Nablus.
Though he was not charged,
his name came up again in
connection with another act
of terror when, in January
2010, the Israeli police
raided his settlement
seeking vandals who had set
fire to a nearby mosque.
One of Shapira's followers,
an American immigrant,
Jack _Mite"", has confessed to
murdering two innocent
Palestinians and attempting
to the kill the liberal Israeli
historian Ze'ev Sternhell
with a mail bomb.
What does all this have to
do with Islamophobic
campaigns in the United
States? A great deal,
actually. Through New
York-based tax-exempt non-
profits like the Central Fund
of Israel and Ateret
Cohenim, for instance, the
omnipresent Aubrey
Chernick has sent tens of
thousands of dollars to
support the Yitzar
settlement, as well as to the
messianic settlers dedicated
to ""Judaizing"" East
Jerusalem. The settlement
movement's leading online
news magazine. Arutz
Sheva, has feattired Geller
as a columnist. A friend of
Geller's, Beth Gili.nsky, a
right-wing activist with a
group called the Coalition to
Honor Ground Zero and the
founder of the Jewish
Action Alliance (apparently
ttun. out of a Manhattan real
estate office), organized a
large rally in New York City
in April 2010 to protest the
Obama administration's call
for a settlement freeze.
Among Chemick's major
funding recipients is a
supposedly ""apolitical""
group called Aish. Hatorah
that claims to educate Jews
about their heritage. Based
in New York and active in
the fever swamps of
northern West Bank
settlements near Yitzar,
Aish Hatorah shares an
address and staff with a
shadowy foreign non-profit
called the Clarion Fund.
During the 2008 U.S.
election campaign, the
Clarion Fund distributed 28
million DVDs of a
propaganda film called
Obsession as newspaper
inserts to residents of swing
states around the country.
The film featured a who's
who of anti-Muslim
activists, including \Valid
Shoebat, a self-proclaimed
""former PLO terrorist.""
Among Shoebat's more
striking statements: ""A
secular dogma like Nazism
is less dangerous than is
Islamofascism today."" At a
Christian gathering in 2007,
this ""former Islamic
terrorist"" told the crowd that
Islam was a ""satanic cult""
and that he had been born
again as an evangelical
Christian. In 2008, however,
the Jerusalem Post, a right-
leaning newspaper, exposed
h rn as a fraud, whose
claims to terrorism were
fictional.
Islamophobic groups
registered only a minimal
impact during the 2008
election campaign. Two
years later, however, after
the Republicans regained
control of the House of
Representatives in midterm
elections, the network
appears to have reached.
critical mass. Of course, the
deciding factor in the
election was the economy,
and in two years, Americans
will likely vote their
pocketbooks again. But that
the construction of a single
Islamic community center or
the imaginary threat of
Sharia law were issues at all
reflected the influence of a
small band of locally
oriented activists, and
suggested that when a
certain presidential
candidate who has already
been demonized as a crypto-
Muslim runs for reelection,
the country's most vocal
Islamophobes could once
again find a national
platform amid the frenzied
atmosphere of the campaign.
By now, the Islamophobic
crusade has gone beyond the
right-wing pro-Israel
activists, cyber-bigots, and
ambitious hucksters who
conceived it. It now belongs
to leading Republican
presidential candidates, top-
rated cable news hosts, and
crowds of Tea Party
activists. As the fervor
spreads, the crusaders are
basking in the glory of what
they accomplished. ""I didn't
choose this moment,"" Geller
mused to the New York
Times, ""this moment chose
me.""

7083,"for your momKeith Richards Has Memories to Burn
By JANET MASLIN
It is 3 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time in the New York office of Keith Richards's manager, a place that might look ordinary if
every wall and shelf were not crammed with some of the world's most glorious rock 'n' roll memorabilia. Mr. Richards has
a 3 o'clock appointment. ""Come on in, he'll be here in a minute,"" an assistant says — and here he comes in a minute, at
3:01. This from a man who once prided himself for operating on Keith Time, as in: the security staff ate the shepherd's pie
that Keith wanted in his dressing room? Then everyone in this packed stadium can bloody well wait. The Rolling Stones
don't play until another shepherd's pie shows up.
Chalk up the promptness to the man's new incarnation: he is now Keith Richards, distinguished author. True, he is far
from the only rock star to turn memoirist, and far from the only Rolling Stone to write a book about himself — very much
about himself. The raven-haired Ron Wood wrote ""Ronnie,"" in which he described Brian Jones as ""me in a blond wig."" Bill
Wyman, the band's retired bass player and bean counter, wrote ""Stone Alone,"" in which not a 15-shilling demo disc went
unmentioned. Now Mr. Richards has written the keeper: ""Life,"" a big, fierce, game-changing account of the Stones' nearly
half-century-long adventure.
""It's the most difficult thing I've ever done,"" he says about the book. ""I'd rather make ro records.""
But he sounds anything but weary. And he seems refreshed, bearing surprisingly little resemblance to the battered, kohl-
eyed pirate Keith Richards who looks like 50 miles of bad road. Today, in neutral street clothes and hot-green shoes, he is
positively debonair. On his hands: the ubiquitous silver skull ring, swollen knuckles, the thin white scar from a hunk of
steaming phosphorus that burned his finger to the bone while he played through a concert without stopping. On his head:
both a headband and a raffish, straw-colored hat, gray tufts poking out in all directions. Not a single gewgaw hangs off it.
""I've been through that phase,"" he says. ""Don't know that the hair will take the pressure anymore.""
He's been through quite a lot of phases. And they're all on the page in ""Life"": the Boy Scout (really); the tyro rocker; the
lovestruck kid (mad for Ronnie Spector, unbeknownst to Phil Spector); the astonished new star; the heroin-addicted older
one; the jaded veteran of countless world tours; and the longtime sparring partner of Mick Jagger. (Despite tabloid shock
over the bickering in the book, these two have seriously been calling each other names at least since the early 198os.) All of
this is recounted with straight-up candor, and some of it is easily sensationalized. But the book's single biggest stunner is a
hand-written note on its jacket flap: ""Believe it or not, I haven't forgotten any of it.""
How, he is asked, is this humanly possible from a man as well known for stupefaction as ""Satisfaction?"" ""I think my main
concern at the beginning was whether my memory was really reliable,"" he says. ""Fox had to do a little sleuthing."" Fox is
James Fox, the journalist and author of ""White Mischief,"" who has been Mr. Richards's friend over many years and was
his collaborator in putting ""Life"" together. (It was sold to Little, Brown & Company for a reported advance of more than $7
million.)
Mr. Fox wound up researching Mr. Richards's past, conducting interviews with those who knew him long ago and drawing
upon wonderfully candid old letters and journal entries. ""Spent day practising,"" the 19-year-old Mr. Richards wrote in
January 1963, when the Stones were just beginning to play in public. ""Worthwhile, I hope!"" Also exhumed: a 1962 letter
from Mr. Richards to his Aunt Patty describing a boy he had known in primary school, Mick Jagger. He signs off
""Luff/Keith XXXXX""
These artifacts turned out to be the Richards equivalent of Proust's madeleines, though Mr. Richards, whose reading taste
runs to naval history and the novels of Patrick O'Brian and George MacDonald Fraser, would hardly put it that way. In any
case they prompted recollections that he never expected to rediscover, and ""Life"" began to click. Once his stories were told
and a draft was written, he and Mr. Fox wound up sitting together with separate copies of the manuscript as Mr. Fox read
B6
the whole book aloud. ""What I couldn't guess was that he'd be such a very good natural editor,"" Mr. Fox, reached by e-
mail, says of Mr. Richards. ""He cut, accordingly, for pace and rhythm — a real musical cut.""
As for calling the book ""Life,"" Mr. Richards did some editing there too. ""My Life"" was what the book was to be called. ""I
said 'I tell you what, just cut off the 'My,' and you've got a title,"" he says. He might just as appropriately have used another
title he likes, ""Keep It Dark."" But, he says, ""I'm saving it for a song.""
The contents of ""Life"" are dark enough already. The book begins with a 1975 drug bust in Arkansas and a judge who was
persuaded to free Mr. Richards after confiscating his hunting knife (which still hangs in the courtroom) and having a
picture taken with him. How did Mr. Richards get so lucky? ""I really can't explain it,"" he says, deadpan, about that now.
""Maybe I've got an honest face.""
It covers many other arrests too, as well as Mr. Richards's grueling efforts to kick his heroin addiction, which he claims to
have done successfully 30 years ago. ""Stories like this aren't told very much,"" he insists. ""There aren't many people willing
to tell them.""
Then there are the other health hazards that the book describes. Like electrocution. ""My most spectacular one was in
Sacramento. ..."" he now says with a smile, drifting off into a fond-sounding reverie that involves a guitar string touching an
ungrounded microphone and clouds of smoke billowing out of his mouth. He has a good laugh at the memory of finding
himself in a hospital and hearing a doctor say, ""Well, they either wake up or they don't.""
""Life"" has already attracted undue attention for a schoolyard-sounding anatomical swipe at Mr. Jagger. But this is a book
that pulls no punches, and most of its disses are more serious than that. ""Cold-blooded"" and ""vicious"" are only two of the
more printable words he uses to describe Brian Jones. Allen Ginsberg was an ""old gasbag."" Mick Taylor, the former
Rolling Stone, ""didn't do anything"" after he left the band, and Donald Cammell, the film director (""Performance,"" starring
Mr. Jagger and Anita Pallenberg, Mr. Richards's longtime lover and partner in crime), couldn't commit suicide quickly
enough to suit Mr. Richards. (He shot himself in 1996.) When Marlon Brando propositioned him and Ms. Pallenberg, Mr.
Richards remembers replying with this: ""Later, pal.""
As for Mr. Jagger, the complaints are deep-seated. They involve credit hogging, social climbing, egomania, insecurity,
unethical business behavior and — here comes a Freudian's holiday for anyone who's ever watched the bare-chested young
Jagger and Richards vamp it up together — uncertain sexual identity. There's also a cool condescension about Mr. Jagger's
contributions to the duo's songwriting. And a nasty nickname or two, like ""Disco Boy.""
In conversation about all this, Mr. Richards is emphatically blase: ""It's bound to be somewhat rough, but the point is I'm
trying to tell the story from Day 1 to now,"" he says. And sure: ""There's the odd conflict here and there. But if you weigh it
all out, those things count for nothing."" Mr. Richards did see to it that Mr. Jagger knew what was in the book ahead of
time. ""The important thing to me,"" he says, ""was that Mick had been through it and seen it and knew what was what.""And
is there anything that one Stone can say about another Stone and really give offense at this point? ""No.""
But is there anything new that can be said about the Stones anyway? As ""Life"" emphatically demonstrates, the answer is
yes. And some of its most surprisingly revelatory material appears in what Mr. Richards jokingly calls ""Keefs Guitar
Workshop."" Here are the secrets of some of the world's most famous rock riffs and the almost toy-level equipment on
which they were recorded, like the cassette recorder onto which Mr. Richards dubbed guitar layer after guitar layer for
""Street Fighting Man,"" ""Jumpin' Jack Flash"" and part of ""Gimme Shelter."" Here's how the silent beats in Elvis Presley's
""Heartbreak Hotel"" worked their way into some of Mr. Richards's most inspired solos. Mr. Fox found that ""Heartbreak
Hotel"" itself was the key to some of Mr. Richards's best musical memories.
Some of this is by now well known to music critics. But Mr. Richards makes it fascinating at the layman's level. And he is
surprised to find that early readers haven't been skipping the musicology, even though the book cordially invites them to
do so. What he finds most gratifying about having written ""Life"" is the chance for both him and his readers to grasp the
breadth and range of this book's material. He is the rare memoirist who can say, without hyperbole, ""that what I hoped
was worth sharing with people turned out to be far more important than I could possibly imagine.""
It's getting late. Time to leave this bright orange room where Mr. Richards's name is emblazoned on a director's chair;
where assorted music awards and platinum records are everywhere; where there's a discreet little skull in the middle of
the wall mirror; where his Louis Vuitton guitar case — he did an ad for Vuitton — is parked in a corner. But the items
likeliest to catch his eye are the ones on the coffee table: loose cigarettes neatly arrayed in a holder, a lighter, more
cigarettes in a pack.
""Do you mind if I smoke?"" he had asked when he first appeared. Easy one: Who, aside from Keith Richards and certain
legal authorities, has ever kept Keith Richards from doing anything? But an hour has gone by, and he hasn't touched the
cigarettes. He hasn't even looked at them. He has done not one thing to make him resemble the sullen, haunted,
diabolically beautiful creature on the cover of his book, the one with hellfire blazing up from his hand to meet the blurry
white thing he's smoking.
""That?"" he says innocently when asked about the picture. ""Oh, that's just me lighting a cigarette. That's all I was doing.""","['New', 'York', 'Arkansas', 'Sacramento']"
7084,"H: Predictable Woodward outcome. Sidaned by Woodward's Fire
by Leslie H. Gelb
September 23, 2010 I 1:32pm
The president and his team cooperated with the famed author's new book. Leslie H. Gelb on the
fallout—and how Obama's Wars shows the U.S. is stuck in an open-ended conflict.
Lots of White House officials observed Bob Woodward, Mr. First Draft of History, repeatedly and boldly slipping behind the
closed doors of President Obama's most intimate advisers. They all knew what was happening. The president's men were
helping The Washington Post's sleuth write ""the inside story"" of how the boss masterfully managed the most trying of
Herculean labors—the war in Afghanistan. There's only one very big problem in dealing with Woodward in this manner:
Once the boss opens the doors to spilling the secrets, many of his subordinates feel liberated to ""tell their side of the
story."" By the time each has exhausted tales of his own heroism and the shortcomings of his fellow senior officials, well,
no one looks terribly heroic.
Let's start with Obama, who emerges from the pages of Obama's Wars as he is—brilliant, emotionless, abstract, focused,
and confused, a Chicago law-school professor in presidents' clothes. He obviously wanted Woodward to portray him as a
brilliant intellectual leader of a government that was not giving him too much help in solving the Afghan mystery, but that
he trudged on, doing the best anyone possibly could under these terrible circumstances.
The worst circumstance, as Team Obama alleged to Woodward, was that the Pentagon leadership and the U.S. generals
did not give him the real choices he was asking for. He wanted options for troop increases below, even far below, what
the generals were giving him. He didn't get them. He wanted a strategy for how U.S. forces would be drawn down after
they reached their projected peak of about 100,000 (more than three times the number George W. Bush left him). The
military didn't provide him with that, either.
As they say in Missouri, ""Give me a break."" If the commander in chief of the United States doesn't know how to get what
he wants from the U.S. military, he might want to do something about that. And some of the many generals in the White
House who he picked to guide him might have told him how to go about that task. To cut to the chase: Obama didn't
understand what he had to do—tell Defense Secretary Bob Gates to tell the generals either they meet the president's
wishes or they will be fired. Republican presidents do just that. And so, as Woodward describes, Obama had to write the
strategy all by himself.
This was and still is an awful situation that springs from two sources. One is that the president has just not been clear
enough about his thinking and objectives for Afghanistan, and the military and the rest of us must have real clarity to
pursue wars. Woodward has this right. Here are a few Obama quotes that illustrate the problem. The president told
Woodward that he didn't think about the Afghan war in the ""classic"" terms of the U.S. winning or losing. ""I think about it
more in terms of: Do you successfully prosecute a strategy that results in the country being stronger rather than weaker at
the end?"" What on earth does that mean? Or try this one, to Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) about whether the July 2011
deadline to begin withdrawal was firm: ""I have to say that. I can't let this be a war without end, and I can't lose the whole
Democratic Party."" Does that mean Obama really believes in the war, but his party doesn't? Or to White House aides:
""This needs to be a plan about how we're going to hand it off and get out of Afghanistan."" So, if he wanted such a plan, he
should have gotten such a plan. He is president after all.
Which leads to the second problem: When a president is not clear about a tough problem, the military smells vacillations.
And they sure don't like vacillation when it comes to dispatching their men and women to war. Americans don't fathom
well the military mentality. The military in most countries throughout history doesn't like to go to war; they like to build up
their arms and overall strength. But once in war, they want only more troops, fewer restrictions on their use, and above all,
victory, victory, victory. Since Vietnam, they smell only vacillation among Democrats, and they don't like it. For their part,
Democrats see insubordination and worse among the military toward them, and they don't care for the suits either. It's not
a happy circumstance. Woodward didn't explore this underlying reality, which is critical for Americans to understand.
breakAd
The White House clash with the military could get worse over the latest news about Gen. Stanley McChrystal's firing over
naughty things said about the White House to a reporter. According to a preliminary Army investigation, the general—and
perhaps even his senior Army aides—were not the sources of those nasty quotes. It was some other guys—you know, the
usual culprits, the Navy and civilians. There will be further formal inquiries on this, but nothing good will come of them.
There's another important thread running throughout the Woodward account that, I believe, he gets more wrong than
right. That is, Woodward's repeated insistence of open and bitter policy brawls in the good old Situation Room (the inner
sanctum for White House meetings) over Afghan policy. Mr. Instant Historian paints a picture of a war of all against all. My
information has always been that there was relative agreement on major policy. Based on my sources, there is no doubt
that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Defense Secretary Bob Gates, and Joint Chiefs Chairman Mike Mullen were almost
always quite cordial and in full lock step. They, along with the NSC Adviser Jim Jones and field commanders like General
McChrystal and General Petraeus, are the key players. Of course, Vice President Joe Biden and Chief of Staff Rahm
Emanuel were the only regular critics of where policy was heading. The generals did lobby for their positions in public—in
advance of presidential decisions. And that's a big no-no. But by that standard, almost all Obama's top advisers did as
much. The day after his West Point speech last December, where he set the firm date of July 2011 to begin unspecified
U.S. troop withdrawals, almost all the advisers publicly stated that maybe one didn't have to take this date too seriously,
that everything was ""conditions based."" That group of rebels included Gates and Clinton.
So, if anything, most of Obama's top counselors were more or less united—sometimes against where he seemed to be
going. Here is what Petraeus had to say to Woodward on the subject of goals, and it's a stunner: ""You have to recognize
also that I don't think you win this war. I think you keep fighting. It's a little bit like Iraq, actually.... Yes, there has been
enormous progress in Iraq. But there are still horrific attacks in Iraq, and you have to stay vigilant. You have to stay after
it. This is the kind of fight we're in for the rest of our lives and probably our kids' lives."" The brilliant general said as much
to others over the last year. It's enough to knock your socks off.
So far, there are no heroes to this narrative, only self-described heroic skeptics of the war and warriors who would fight on
forever.
Doubtless, President Obama does not want to fight an open-ended war. He's sworn to that time and again, and I believe
him, despite his history of calling for ""victory"" and ""defeat"" of the Taliban and al Qaeda. But what the Woodward book
demonstrates is that Obama and his team just don't know how to get from here to there. So far, there are no heroes to
this narrative, only self-described heroic skeptics of the war and warriors who would fight on forever.

Common Sense Can Rescue American Foreign Policy (HarperCollins 2009), a book that shows how to think about and
use power in the 21st century. He is president emeritus of the Council on Foreign Relations.

Iraq. I also assume that you saw the report last June that they were seized by a Revolutionary Guard officer now held for
drug running and murder.
It seems that the hikers were too close to a drug trail. I will send you memos on latest political intel and policy ideas for

US Hikers Were Seized in Iraq

KURDISTAN PROVINCE, IRAN—
Since their arrest last July by Iranian forces near the Iraq
border, three Americans — Shane Bauer, Josh Fattal and
Sarah Shourd — have been at the center of a high-stakes
diplomatic struggle between Tehran and Washington. Iranian
authorities have repeatedly accused the three of entering Iran
to conduct espionage. Meanwhile, friends and family of the
three, along with the State Department, the Committee to
Protect Journalists, The Nation and The Investigative Fund
[Bauer has written Investigative Fund stories that appeared in
The Nation and Mother Jones], have rejected the spying
charge and suggested that the Americans accidentally crossed
the border while on a recreational hike. Despite a well-
publicized visit by the detainees' mothers in May, Iran has
released little information about the circumstances of their
arrest or the status of their case.
The Nation and The Investigative Fund have located two
witnesses to the arrest who claim that Bauer, Fattal and
Shourd were on Iraqi territory when they were arrested — not
in Iran, as Iranian officials have asserted. Two additional
sources report that the Revolutionary Guards officer who
likely ordered their detention has since been arrested on
charges of smuggling, kidnapping and murder.
The witnesses are residents of a Kurdish village in Iraq called
Zalem, which lies a few miles from the Iran border; they
declined to be identified, fearing retaliation from Iranian
forces, who have been known to conduct missions across the
border. The witnesses separately reported noticing the three
Americans as they hiked up a mountain in the scenic Khormal
region, which straddles the border. Part of the mountain lies
in Iraq and part in Iran, but except for a few watchtowers and
occasional signposts, the border here is largely unmarked,
although local residents are familiar with its boundaries.
The witnesses, who followed the Western-looking hikers out
of curiosity, say that around 2 pm on July 31, as the hikers
descended the mountain, uniformed guards from NAJA,
Iran's national police force, waved the hikers toward the
Iranian side using ""threatening"" and ""menacing"" gestures.
When their calls were ignored, one officer fired a round into
the air. As the hikers continued to hesitate, the guards walked
a few yards into Iraqi territory, where they lack jurisdiction,
and apprehended them.
These witness accounts corroborate a statement Bauer made
on May 20 during a tele-vised reunion at a Tehran hotel
between the hikers and their mothers. As the New York Times
reported, Bauer ""denied that they had walked into Iran, as
they were accused of doing, before stopping himself and
saying, 'We can't really talk about that.""
Farhad Lohoni, a local tribal leader, had previously claimed
that the American hikers had been snatched from Iraq in a
cross-border raid by Iranian agents, as reported in the Daily
Telegraph in August 2009. Lohoni said that his relatives had
seen a group of men cross the border into Iraq, and he told the
Telegraph that the hikers ""were targeted and captured by a
group that came over from Iran, ignoring Iraq's sovereignty.
We know this and it means that Iran must have wanted to take
Americans hostage at this sensitive time.""
A State Department spokesman said that he had been unaware
of evidence that the three were arrested in Iraqi territory but
would not comment further.
Once captured, Bauer, Fattal and Shourd were sped by car to
the local headquarters of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards in
Marivan, a town close to the border in the province of
Kurdistan. When they arrived, according to two sources, the
Americans were remanded into the custody of Lt. Col. Heyva
Taab, then head of the Revolutionary Guards' intelligence
unit in the region. According to these sources — a former
member of the Revolutionary Guards and an official who
serves in the provincial government at Sanandaj — only Taab
would have had the authority to order the Americans'
detention and eventual transfer to Tehran. A branch of the
Iranian military with at least 125,000 personnel, the
Revolutionary Guards are responsible for maintaining
national security throughout the Islamic Republic.
""When I heard the news that they had arrested American
hikers, I immediately thought, This is the work of the
intelligence arm of the Revolutionary Guards, because they
have people in this region,"" says Idris Ahmedi, an Iranian
Kurdish exile and a regional expert who is a visiting scholar
at Georgetown University. ""I thought they were most likely
lured into Iranian Kurdistan, where they could arrest them. It
is consistent with Iran's past actions.""
Less than a month later, in late August 2009, Taab himself
was arrested and charged with the July 6 murder of the son of
Mostafa Shirzadi, the Imam Joma (Friday prayer leader) of
Marivan, an influential cleric in the region. Shirzadi's nephew
was also allegedly killed by Taab. Since his arrest Taab has
been implicated in a vast criminal enterprise encompassing a
profitable smuggling operation and dozens of murders, rapes
and kidnappings. According to the Sanandaj official,
numerous lawsuits, perhaps hundreds, have been filed against
Taab in Kurdistan, alleging libel, theft, rape, kidnapping and
murder. Taab's case has twice been before a judge, and he
awaits execution in a Tehran prison.
Although the state-run Iranian press has not reported on
Taab's crimes, they were made public in a series of articles in
January and February by a Kurdish news site, Kurdistan Va
Kurdnews, run by the Kurdistan Democratic Party. A
February 17 article describes Taab as the head of a ""criminal
band"" and reports that Taab and seven accomplices were
under arrest by the Revolutionary Guards for their role in a
vast number of illegal killings.
Several sources describe Taab as the central power in
Kurdistan province. According to locals and experts, control
of the border lies in the hands of the Revolutionary Guards, in
particular their intelligence unit, Etelaat Sepah, whose local
division had been commanded by Taab for about five years.
""At this point it's really the Sepah, the Revolutionary Guards,
that are in charge, especially in the western provinces,
especially because the Americans are on the other side, in
Iraq,"" says Kaveh Ehsani, an assistant professor of
international studies at DePaul University and an Iran expert
who serves as a contributing editor to the journal Middle East
Report. ""On the surface the security force [NAJA] is in
charge, but it really is the Revolutionary Guards that control
the borders.""
It is a region where, according to several Iran experts,
smuggling and cross-border traffic are routine. The Iraq-Iran
border is ""relatively porous because it's mountainous,"" says
Faraz Sanei, an Iran researcher at Human Rights Watch,
which issued a report last year on political freedom in Iranian
Kurdistan. Sanei describes the border as a common escape
route for dissidents —journalists, human rights advocates
and Iranian Kurds—as well as a commonly used trade route
for goods. ""Smuggling is something that has taken place and
continues to take place there, whether it be of goods or of
humans across the border. It's something that happens quite
often.""
Soon after Taab took charge of the Sepah in the northwestern
quadrant of Kurdistan, he began to enrich himself off the
black-market border economy. According to the Sanandaj
official and the former Revolutionary Guards officer, who
had firsthand knowledge of Taab's activities, Taab's first
scheme involved selling merchandise confiscated from petty
smugglers, known as koolbars, who traffic consumer goods
across the border (a trade depicted in the Iranian film A Time
for Drunken Horses, which won the Camera d'Or at Cannes
in 2000).
The region is also home to a variety of Kurdish nationalist
groups that have been demanding autonomy from the central
Tehran government. One of these, the Party for Free Life in
Kurdistan (PJAK), is affiliated with the Kurdistan Workers'
Party, a Kurdish separatist organization that engages in armed
conflict within Turkey and has been labeled a terrorist
organization by the United States and other governments.
Since 2005 PJAK, based in the mountains in Kurdish Iraq,
has been in open conflict with Tehran and has claimed
responsibility for killing dozens of Revolutionary Guards
soldiers in cross-border raids on Iranian military bases, as
well as for the February 2007 downing of an Iranian military
helicopter by a shoulder-launched missile in Khoy, in
Western Azerbaijan province, which killed thirteen Iranian
soldiers.
It has been speculated that some of these Kurdish militants
enjoy US support. In April 2006, Representative Dennis
Kucinich wrote a letter to President Bush questioning whether
the US government was ""fomenting opposition and
supporting military operations in Iran among insurgent groups
and Iranian ethnic minority groups, some of whom are
operating from Iraq."" Kucinich named two groups, including
PJAK. In November of that year, Seymour Hersh reported in
The New Yorker that ""Israel and the United States have also
been working together in support of a Kurdish resistance
group known as the Party for Free Life in Kurdistan,"" and that
a government consultant told him that the Israeli government
had provided ""equipment and training"" to PJAK.
The United States and Israel have denied any involvement
with PJAK. Still, these allegations of support have gained
substantial traction inside Iran and may have undergirded
Taab's decision to detain Bauer, Fattal and Shourd as well as
the repeated public charges of espionage against the three. In
early April, for instance, Iranian Intelligence Minister Heydar
Moslehi told Iran's Press TV that ""it is quite obvious to us
that the three Americans arrested in Iran last year had links
with Western and Israeli intelligence services.""
The Iranian government has retaliated against rising Kurdish
militancy by launching a counteroffensive on PJAK, inside
Iran and across the border in Iraq. In August 2007, for
example, Iranian soldiers crossed into Iraq and attacked
several villages, McClatchy reported. Most recently, on June
4, officials in Iraq's semiautonomous Kurdish region alleged
that ""a small unit of Iranian soldiers,"" including a tank and
several other vehicles, had penetrated more than a mile into
Iraqi Kurdistan's Arbil province in search of Kurdish rebels.
Until his arrest, Taab was a key player in Iran's counter-
offensive. The former Revolutionary Guards officer says that
several current members of the Guards told him that Taab's
stated goal was to ""completely wipe out PJAK"" in his
jurisdiction. According to Alunedi, the scholar at
Georgetown, Taab was involved in recent cross-border
assassinations of Iranian Kurds in Iraqi Kurdistan. The
Kurdish weekly Awena reported that Taab and his unit
assassinated two Kurds on December 15, 2008.
According to the former officer and the Sanandaj official,
Taab's criminal enterprise grew beyond smuggling in 2007,
when he made his first forays into murder. Koolbars, the petty
border smugglers, are often killed by land mines or fatally
shot by border police. So Taab concocted a scheme to kidnap
koolbars as well as ordinary unemployed Iranian Kurdish
civilians, dress them in the uniforms of PJAK insurgents and
then kill them—claiming they'd died in a military clash—in
order to collect a bounty, as high as $40,000 a head, from his
superiors in the Revolutionary Guards. He was assisted in this
plot by at least nine others, seven of whom have been
apprehended. The article in Kurdistan Va Kurdnews named
all seven, including Haji Majid Muqimiyan of Kermansha,
identified as a ringleader.
PJAK has officially denied involvement in these border
clashes, including in a May 3, 2009, post to the Iranian
website Tabnak, which is published by Mohsen Rezai, a
former head of the Revolutionary Guards. Many of the PJAK
clashes may, in fact, have been ""bogus,"" said the Sanandaj
official. ""More or less no clashes with PJAK have been
reported in the area since Heyva Taab and his gang were
busted.""
A mother of one koolbar tearfully described her son's
disappearance. She said he went missing the same day in
early 2009 that the government later claimed a clash with
PJAK had taken place. The woman, a resident of a border
town in Iranian Kurdistan, is a plaintiff in one of the lawsuits
against Taab; she asked that her name and location not be
mentioned, for fear that it would harm her case in court.
Taab's scheme was wildly successful, according to the
Sanandaj official, who said one bank account under Taab's
name has had nearly $6 million deposited in it since 2008.
This macabre scheme ended only in the spring of 2009, when
Taab killed a local official's brother who was seeking work in
the area and, more decisively, last July when he killed the
cleric's son.
On June 11 Mohammad Javad Larijani, secretary general of
Iran's High Council for Human Rights, said that the
government's investigation was nearly complete and a trial
for Bauer, Fattal and Shourd ""should not be very far from
now."" In a statement issued on June 17, the mothers of the
hikers called on Iran either to prosecute or release their
children. ""Iran has no legitimate reason at this stage not to
release them or move forward with a fair trial in which our
children can openly answer any allegations against them.""
""These new revelations, if indeed true, show the hikers have
been victims of political machinations and manipulation,""
said Hadi Ghaemi, executive director of the International
Campaign for Human Rights in Iran. ""The fact that they have
been held for so long without prosecution strongly supports
this trend. Under Iranian laws, they have committed no crime
and should be released immediately. Their Iranian lawyer,
who has studied the judicial files against them, has
consistently maintained the only charge against them is illegal
entry, which is subject to a fine and not arbitrary detention for
so long. With this new information, even that charge appears
fabricated, and there is no basis for holding them.""
As of the press date, Shane Bauer, Josh Fattal and Sarah
Shourd have been detained by Iran for ten months and
twenty-three days.

Iran Seized U.S. Hikers in Iraq, U.S. Report
Asserts
By MICHAEL R. GORDON and ANDREW W. LEHREN
Iran has accused three American hikers of illegally crossing into Iranian territory in July 2009 and is still holding two of
them in prison. But a classified American military report made public by WikiLeaks, which describes the chaotic day when
the hikers were detained, asserts that the hikers were on the Iraqi side of the border when they were seized.
The initial reports of any incident are not always correct. But one American government official who served in Iraq said
that the field report was generally consistent with what he had been told by Iraqi officials — namely, that the hikers were
close to the border but on the Iraqi side.
The episode began when four Americans traveled from Syria to northern Iraq, planning to hike up the Ahmed Awa, a
mountainous area with a dramatic waterfall. One American, Shon Meckfessel, became ill and stayed behind when his
friends — Shane M. Bauer, Joshua F. Fattal and Sarah E. Shourd — set out on July 31.
A July 31 field report states that Mr. Meckfessel learned of the arrests when a ""female called him saying they were being
surrounded by armed men.""
At first, the American military did not know who was holding the Americans. An intelligence officer at the American Army
division based in northern Iraq, the report notes, initially described the event as a ""kidnapping"" and said the three
American tourists ""were being taken to the Iranian border.""
The report lists a number of military grids where the Americans were believed to have been hiking or had been detained
— all on the Iraqi side of the border.
As documented in the report, the frenetic effort to locate the American hikers and to inter-view Mr: Meckfessel appeared to
support the claim that they were tourists and not American intelligence operatives, as Iran has alleged. A drone aircraft
was sent to look for the missing Americans, and two F-16s jet fighters were alerted. American Special Operations forces
were sent to pick up Mr. Meckfessel, so he could be taken to Baghdad for questioning.
As the day wore on, the Americans received a report from an officer with the pesh merga, the Kurdish military force in
northern Iraq, that the Iranians had detained three American citizens ""for being too close to the border."" The July report
reflects some frustration with the hikers for their ""lack of coordination"" in venturing to northern Iraq and offers some
thoughts on the episode's broader implications.
""The leadership in Iran benefits as it focuses the Iranian population on a perceived external threat rather than internal
dissension,"" it notes.

There is a context section at the bottom, which is longer than I would like, but I
think it is important to articulate what I saw and whom I spoke with (and what I
didn't see and whom I didn't meet) so that you understand my data set and its clear
limitations. To say I was profoundly disturbed by what I saw - and didn't see -
would be an understatement. The incompetence is mind numbing. Not incidentally,
it rained twice while I was there. If we do not quickly change the organization,
management, accountability and delivery paradigm on the ground, we could quite
conceivably confront tens of thousands of children's deaths by diarrhea, dysentery,
typhoid and other water-related diseases in the near future. Below are my major
takeaways and a few nascent/early thoughts on what we (however we define we)
could to do drive significant and incremental improvements on the ground in the
near and longer term. As is often said, if I had more time - and less emotion - I
would have written a shorter letter. I hope this mini-behemoth is not rife with
grammatical errors or inadvertent gaps; I am sorry if either true.
Please do not forward this in whole or in part attributed to me without asking me
first - happy to be an invisible soldier. Mainly hope this is even marginally helpful.
Thanks,
Chelsea
Takeaways are below, with illustrative examples, in a logical flow, not order of
importance. Bolded what I think most important.:
Haitians want to help themselves and want the international community to
help them help themselves - this sounds obvious but wasn't to some of the
UN and International NGO (INGO) folks I ran across. The UN people I
encountered were frequently out of touch (e.g., would not have been off
Logbase in days - or ever), anachronistic at best and arrogant and
incompetent at worst (e.g., one woman from the UN -UNDP I think - told me
she was waiting for the Haitians to ""demand their political rights"" - when
they're asking for tents, latrines, soap, food and not getting that....)
In fact, Haitians in the settlements are very much organizing themselves,
in part to help define their needs and then articulate them to the UN/
INGO community. Fairly nuanced settlement governance structures
have already developed. The largest settlement I visited in Parc Jean Marie
Vincent (40k and counting) had an overall governing committee with a head
of the governing committee (voted on by the governing committee); a
women's committee; a security committee; a sanitation committee (with a
soap subcommittee), etc. Women comprised 50% of each committee. One of
the most illuminating anecdotes from my trip was talking with the head of
the security committee and a few other settlement residents, including 2
women from the governing committee. The security committee wanted 100
tshirts - at least though I think they'll need at least 2-3x that - so that the
security volunteers could wear them when patrolling so that people,
particularly women, would feel safe when they saw them approach in groups
of 2 or 3. They also ideally wanted flashlights to also use on night patrol.
Finally, they wanted to be able to pay the security team (though this was less
important than the first two 'asks'). IF that option were not feasible, their
second choice was for the US Army to come into the settlement and patrol at
night. Not the Haitian police (unreliable) and not the UN (dismissed). They
wanted to help themselves, and they wanted reliability and accountability.
The settlements' governing bodies - as they shared with me - are
beginning to experience UN/ INGO fatigue given how often they articulate
their needs, willingness to work - and how little is coming their way. Tents
and latrines / sanitation remain the largest urgent needs - obvious to
anyone with a minimum knowledge of public health and the settlement
residents themselves
The Haitian government appears to have an emergent, albeit still
largely lacking in specifics, plan of action (detailed below), for both the
near (to get through the next 6-12 months) and longer term (while
rebuilding over next -5 years)
The Haitian government's inability to articulate its plan quickly enough
or in sufficient terms to the UN/ INGO community has lead to a
proliferation of ad hoc efforts by the UN and INGOs to 'help,' some of
which have helped (e.g., we met no one who was worried about water
supplies in camps even though it's a motley crue of French Red Cross, Oxfam,
IMO/IOM, etc that have achieved that), some of which have hurt (e.g., the
largest settlement we visited had 1 latrine to every 1,000 people or 40 for
-40k though given the settlements' growth rate its probably 40 for -45k
today; there should be 1 for every 50 people or 800+ latrines) and some
which have not happened at all (e.g., the only settlements with lights at
night are those in areas that had lights before that continue to work;
settlement at the Petionville Golf Club, for instance, has some lights at night
while most sit in darkness)
This disorganization across the UN/ INGOs has had a variety of effects
on the Haitian government, including that it it has now visibly distanced
itself from the UN Cluster process (e.g., instead of going to a meeting a day
the Haitian Minister of Health is now going once a week - because it was
""such a waste of time"" and he said that is representative of the government's
current modus operandi); though we heard the cluster process was
improving - when I asked for a concrete example of how, I was told meetings
were ""more efficient."" This lack of efficiency - not to mention lack of visible
consistent progress - has also lead to a further distrust of the UN/ INGOs
by the Haitian government and Haitian people in the settlements. The
former feels like it shows up to no effect - and the latter feels like very
few actor(s) reliably show up
Again, the UN seemed at best chaotic and at worst absent as I travelled
around in an action-oriented sense - I saw few IOM/IMO tents in settlements
or workers or evidence of work; no evidence of WHO; no evidence of OSHA;
no evidence of... You get the picture. I did see lots of UN peacekeepers riding
around however in their vans, humvees, etc. Though on the point of trucks, I
asked how many trucks were in the country - including the non-Port Au
Prince UN 'bases' - and no one could tell me. There appears to be NO
accessible and usable UN inventory system or logistics operation. WFP,
for instance, is largely piggy backing on the US Army/ SOUTHCOM but the
""UN"" / OSHA could not tell me how many trucks WFP had, much less how
many the UN itself had. I counted - I kid you not - hundreds of trucks and
cars at the UN logbase and other UN bases we drove by
UNICEF was the only UN agency that seemed to be universally
acknowledged to be doing a good job by settlements' residents, by
Haitian doctors and by INGO partners, perhaps in part because of its
narrowly defined agenda currently in Haiti (vaccinations) and that its
reliable - i.e., it shows up when it says it will in the settlements and other
central locations
There is NO accountability in the UN system or international
humanitarian system (including for/ among INGOs), this is not new news
but it is one area that the Cluster approach had aimed to remedy - e.g., there
is no feedback mechanism for when the British Red Cross dug the 34 of the
40 above latrines only 3 feet deep and didn't tell the residents when they
would come and extract the latrines or properly train people to take care of
the latrines, etc. - that malpractice continuum is appalling and the British
Red Cross should know better—at the least, the British Red Cross
subsequently should not be allowed to dig elsewhere/ 'do' latrines
The cash-for-work program the UN heralds is not working optimally, to
put it mildly. It currently focuses - perhaps solely - on debris cleaning -
important no doubt - but it has not extended its work into the
settlements or helped set standardized, and differentiated wages, for
settlement work. For instance, the UN cash for work program should have
already started to pay people in the more organized camps - to clean
latrines; 'guard' latrines, including insuring kids use soap; be teachers; be on
security patrol; be on evacuation duty; work with the WFP during the XYZ
drop times, etc.... NONE of this is happening as far as I can tell. When we
were there the cash for work program head was still focused only - it
appeared - on rubble cleaning.
Re: education in the settlements and beyond: This is theoretically the
responsibility of UNICEF and Save the Children - I heard they're starting to
work on this but that is all I know. Ad hoc schools have begun in some of the
camps. We met a woman - our host in fact - who working with the Israeli
Agency for International Development Cooperation - had started schools in 4
settlements for at least the next month.
The World Food Program continues to NOT buy locally - which is
probably now a moot point as it appears that the dairy, fruit, vegetable and
grain stores have all spoiled. The WFP also seems to have been rather erratic
in the early days but most people I spoke to said WFP is now more
systematic and reliable in its food delivery. However, it had not yet
started to deliver cooking and eating utensils though these are promised for
next week.
In contrast to the UN, there appears to be respect for the US Military on
the ground - for the Army particularly as that is the branch people see
guarding the hospital - and it is a negative comment on the UN forces given
their effective absence. I saw no anti-US graffiti though the walls now are
covered in parts of downtown with anti 'ONG' (NGO) and anti-UN graffiti.
(Also, not only graffiti writers with the above sentiments; one of the Haitian
doctors I met said, ""We must be so poor we can't tell them [UN and INGOs]
what to do - or kick them out and use the money ourselves.""). There is also
great fear - at least from the Haitian and ex-pat medical community-
that the Army is leaving soon largely because of the security and total
organization vacuum that would then be left around the hospital. The
UN community, in contrast, did not seem to be perturbed by this prospect.
On an unrelated note, the absence of the Catholic Church's efforts is
notable, particularly given the high death toll among priests, nuns and
seminarians. Catholic Relief Services is present.
Thoughts on what is needed - and what we could do below. (I know much of this
is familiar.):
The Office of Special Envoy - i.e., you Dad - needs authority over the UN
and all its myriad parts - which I do believe would give you effective
authority over much of then INGO sphere given how persistently the
collective humanitarian community holding onto cluster approach. I know
you know this and are working on it. OSHA clearly is failing on the ground,
otherwise it could be ""empowered"" to do this but it ostensibly already is.
However, regardless of the attachment to clusters, there needs to be a
single point of authority either over UN / INGO efforts on the ground
organized in one of two principle ways: either expertise areas (e.g.,
latrines, lights) or by settlements/ Port Au Prince regions with constituent
settlements, with full structures - e.g., finance, procurement, project
management etc., understanding certain functional areas would be cross-
cutting (e.g., pay for work)
There needs to be a coordinated logistics effort which should follow from
the above with an urgency on procurement and deployment of latrines,
tents and lights - and what is needed to support installment, servicing,
maintenance, etc of each. In parallel, a new logistics center/ warehouse
coordinating facility should be built; every non-UN logistics-focused person I
talked to said a need exists for a new logistic center near the major seaport.
A plan must be developed for the rainy season, which is already on us,
particularly for the settlements and it should include answers to questions
like where can people evacuate to when it rains? How will they access food
and water and latrines, at a minimum, from those spaces? Also, could those
places be multipurpose, e.g., also schools and clinic tents/semi permanent
structures (one engineer talked to me about fiberglass?)?
On pay for work, UN needs to expand its mandate and coordinate with
relevant INGO partners to start employing people, at differential wages, in
the settlements and coordinate with the groups above to ensure consistent
wages until a 'market' could develop
The UN - IMO/IOM - or someone needs to take a monthly census of the
settlements at the minimum
Speaking of censuses, the UN also needs a census of itself and its materials
in country - including of the peacekeeper bases outside Port Au Prince.
For example, we drove by 2 bases on the way to Cange and there were
collectively, I would estimate, more than a hundred trucks and buses just
sitting between the two, as well as at least 800 Napali soldiers (according to
locals) laying effectively fallow - and I don't think anyone expects an
outbreak of violence on the Central Plateau in the near future so even if they
and their colleagues are deployed under UN Charter Chapter 6, surely
preserving the peace could be interpreted to work with the settlements? At
the least, their hardware could be used more effectively in Port Au Prince
Special/ extraordinary management needed around areas that have
received significant attention and offers of assistance, e.g., the general
hospital in Port Au Prince which multiple actors, including Sarkozy, have
now offered to rebuild
Holistically, all of the above should support the Haitian government both
actually and ostensibly to not undermine its authority and also to help
augment and build local capacity and capabilities, where feasible
The UN/ INGO should look to source locally or work with local partners
whenever possible, post emergency phase at the least. For example, work
with local solar light producers, buy from local t-shirt factories (if any
survived outside Port Au Prince), mandate WFP first look to local producers,
etc. Now bias I think has to be on quickest production but in medium term
that should accommodate a local dimension
Re: USNS Comfort: for as long as it is there, at a minimum, its mission
should be expanded such that its military and civilian staff could work
on the physical therapy of earthquake related victims and ideally care for
non-earthquake related cases.
Re: US Army: If its mission is largely coming to an end, I hope there is a
succession plan for its current tasks, e.g., the hospital security, that the
Haitian government is comfortable with; currently Haitian government/ at
least Haitian government people on the proverbial ground have no idea what
the transfer plan is
Re: medical evacuations: think this will be improved given our collectively-
experienced chaos on Sunday
Re: mental health in settlements and beyond: clear people are thinking
about this now - largely because Dad asked about it and made it prominent -
but still unclear what the action plan is
Re: Haitian plan: I am not sure it's the best plan, but it is a plan and we
should work with the government to flush out the details so it is robust and
actionable - not sure who the we is here probably most of all
Re: Catholic church: Could we reach out to the Vatican - or even Catholic
groups/ prominent Catholics domestically to raise money and the necessary
expertise to rebuild the central cathedral and main seminary? It would
be a powerful symbolic statement - and put lots of people to work
Re: status, including mental health of workers there, both Haitian and
ex-pat: I am consciously leaving this off as I just can't process right now
FYI: Emergent Haitian government plan of action, as I understand it:
o Near term/ for the next year
■ Buttress the settlements that currently exist that are not
in the lowest lying flood plans, i.e., get tents and latrines in
place, ensure sufficient amounts of clean water flowing in or
being brought, ensure food supplies sufficient, ensure security
and safety (though this seems to be people-focused only);
ensure medical care accessible; start schools at least for the
youngest children.
▪ Move people who are in the settlements in the worst
geographies for flooding or practical reasons/ other
reasons (e.g., the one currently with 4000 people on the prime
minister's lawn) to pre-constructed tent settlements
elsewhere - they have built the first of these already with INGO
Shelter Box though apparently the tents were put up too close
to one another
• Areas lacking in mention when I heard the above
discussed: a solution to ensure people have somewhere to go
when the heavy rains come; ensure continuity of key services
once the rains come; a solution to ensure people are paid how
to ensure sufficient light in the camps, clearly critical to
security (rapes are skyrocketing and I know there were at least
2 murders in one camp on Saturday night); what the right spec
of tent is for any of the above - housing, clinic, evacuation,
school and what could be multipurpose; plan for older
children/young adults who may be too old for initial school
plan; how to best support / help create where needed
settlement governance; how to census, on a semi-regular basis,
who is in the settlements
® Over next 6-12 months:
o Assess which homes are sufficiently safe for families
to return to and subsequently encourage them to do
so; government estimates this will be —30% of all
homes/families (though this seems to be a guess, i.e., no
evidence base)
• Build semi-permanent settlements or augment pre-
existing villages around Port Au Prince where
feasible to enable the government to move people
out of settlements to those sites. End goal is to move
400-1000 families to each of these as needed
o Longer-term:
• Rebuilt Port Au Prince though it is unclear how/if/why people
would move back or what the government's post-rebuild
vision looks like
■ Build more robust health, education etc systems than existed
before the earthquake
■ *Clearly this is the less well-defined part of the ""plan""
Context
I spent the last four days in Haiti. I was with Paul Farmer (Paul) and Partners in
Health (PIH) the entire time - in Port Au Prince Thursday, Friday and Sunday
afternoon and at PIH sites in Laconville and Cange, in the Central Plateau region
Saturday and Sunday morning. I sat in on Paul's formal meetings in Port Au Prince
with: the Haitian Minister of Health Alex Larsen and his team; the Haitian
government official ostensibly overseeing the reconstruction efforts/ UN liaison
Leslie Voltaire; a x-UN group preparing for the PDNA (post disaster needs
assessment) conference in New York at the end of March working on giving 'voice to
the voiceless,' i.e., the designated 15minutes at the conference to highlight the voices
of those most affected (the 15 minutes I gather are happening at all only because of
Cheryl and Paul), UNDP, UNHCR and others were represented; a group interested in
building a logistics center for the reconstruction efforts, i.e., outside the UN ambit,
including people from Royal Caribbean, McKinsey and the people we were traveling
with, including Wes Edens, CEO of Fortress and a supporter of PIH - and the person
who donated, and continues to donate the space at the Miami airport that PIH,
Clinton Foundation, University of Miami Medical Center and others are using to
move goods by air and sea, via transfer, to Haiti. Informally, I talked with: people in
settlements and settlement committee heads, through a translator; local Haitian
doctors; ex-pat PIH and other doctors in mobile clinics in settlements; doctors,
nurses and US police officers I ran into on the street, at dinner, at their ad hoc
residence in the abandoned Aristide Foundation; Maryse Kedar who hosted us our
nights in Port Au Prince, a member of the local elite, and her ad hoc Israel volunteers
(from the Israeli Agency for International Development Cooperation, ie their USAID,
as mentioned above); a broad swath of people serving on the USNS Comfort, both on
and off the ship; US Army enlisted and officers whenever I saw them; Louise Ivers,
head of PIH in Haiti, and others we met or ran into along the way.","['Logbase', 'US', 'Haiti', 'US', 'Port', 'Au', 'Prince', 'Cange', 'Central', 'Plateau', 'Port', 'Au', 'Prince', 'Special', 'Port', 'Au', 'Prince', 'Port', 'Au', 'Prince', ')', 'Port', 'Au', 'Prince', 'Haiti', 'Port', 'Au', 'Prince', 'Thursday', 'Laconville', 'Cange', 'Central', 'Plateau', 'Port', 'Au', 'Prince', 'New', 'York', 'Miami', 'Haiti', 'US', 'Port', 'Au', 'Prince', 'Israel', 'USAID', 'Haiti']"

There is a context section at the bottom, which is longer than I would like, but I
think it is important to articulate what I saw and whom I spoke with (and what I
didn't see and whom I didn't meet) so that you understand my data set and its clear
limitations. To say I was profoundly disturbed by what I saw - and didn't see -
would be an understatement. The incompetence is mind numbing. Not incidentally,
it rained twice while I was there. If we do not quickly change the organization,
management, accountability and delivery paradigm on the ground, we could quite
conceivably confront tens of thousands of children's deaths by diarrhea, dysentery,
typhoid and other water-related diseases in the near future. Below are my major
takeaways and a few nascent/early thoughts on what we (however we define we)
could do to drive significant and incremental improvements on the ground in the
near and longer term. As is often said, if I had more time - and less emotion - I
would have written a shorter letter. I hope this mini-behemoth is not rife with
grammatical errors or inadvertent gaps; I am sorry if either true.
Please do not forward this in whole or in part attributed to me without asking me
first - happy to be an invisible soldier. Mainly hope this is even marginally helpful.
Thanks,

Takeaways are below, with illustrative examples, in a logical flow, not order of
importance. Bolded what I think most important.:
- Haitians want to help themselves and want the international community to
help them help themselves - this sounds obvious but wasn't to some of the
UN and International NGO (INGO) folks I ran across. The UN people I
encountered were frequently out of touch (e.g., would not have been off
Logbase in days - or ever), anachronistic in their thinking at best and
arrogant and incompetent at worst (e.g., one woman from the UN - UNDP I
think - told me she was waiting for the Haitians to ""demand their political
rights"" - when they're asking for tents, latrines, soap, food and not getting
that....)
In fact, Haitians in the settlements are very much organizing themselves,
in part to help define their needs and then articulate them to the UN/
INGO community. Fairly nuanced settlement governance structures
have already developed. The largest settlement I visited in Parc Jean Marie
Vincent (40k and counting) had an overall governing committee with a head
of the governing committee (voted on by the governing committee); a
women's committee; a security committee; a sanitation committee (with a
soap subcommittee), etc. Women comprised 50% of each committee. One of
the most illuminating anecdotes from my trip was talking with the head of
the security committee and a few other settlement residents, including 2
women from the governing committee. The security committee wanted 100
tshirts -though I think they'll need at least 2-3x that - so that the security
volunteers could wear them when patrolling so that people, particularly
women, would feel safe when they saw them approach in groups of 2 or 3.
They also ideally wanted flashlights to also use on night patrol. Finally, they
wanted to be able to pay the security team (though this was less important
than the first two `asks'). IF that option were not feasible, their second choice
was for the US Army to come into the settlement and patrol at night. Not the
Haitian police (unreliable) and not the UN (dismissed). They wanted to help
themselves, and they wanted reliability and accountability from their
partners.
The settlements' governing bodies - as they shared with me - are
beginning to experience UN/ INGO fatigue given how often they articulate
their needs, willingness to work - and how little is coming their way. Tents
and latrines / sanitation remain the largest urgent needs - obvious to
anyone with a minimum knowledge of public health and the settlement
residents themselves
The Haitian government appears to have an emergent, albeit still
largely lacking in specifics, plan of action (detailed below), for both the
near (to get through the next 6-12 months) and longer term (while
rebuilding over next -5 years)
The Haitian government's inability to articulate its plan quickly enough
or in sufficient terms to the UN/ INGO community has lead to a
proliferation of ad hoc efforts by the UN and INGOs to 'help,' some of
which have helped (e.g., we met no one who was worried about water
supplies in camps even though it's a motley crue of French Red Cross, Oxfam,
IMO/IOM, etc that have achieved that), some of which have hurt (e.g., the
largest settlement we visited had 1 latrine to every 1,000 people or 40 for
-40k though given the settlements' growth rate its probably 40 for -45k
today; there should be 1 for every 50 people or 800+ latrines) and some
which have not happened at all (e.g., the only settlements with lights at
night are those in areas that had lights before that continue to work;
settlement at the Petionville Golf Club, for instance, has some lights at night
while most sit in darkness)
This disorganization across the UN/ INGOs has had a variety of effects
on the Haitian government, including that it has now visibly distanced
itself from the UN Cluster process (e.g., instead of going to a meeting a day
the Haitian Minister of Health is now going once a week - because it was
""such a waste of time"" and he said that is representative of the government's
current modus operandi); though we heard the cluster process was
improving - when I asked for a concrete example of how, I was told meetings
were ""more efficient."" This lack of efficiency - not to mention lack of visible
consistent progress - has also lead to a further distrust of the UN/ INGOs
by the Haitian government and Haitian people in the settlements. The
former feels like it shows up to no effect - and the latter feels like very
few actor(s) reliably show up

around in an action-oriented sense - I saw few IOM/IMO tents in settlements
or workers or evidence of work; no evidence of WHO; no evidence of OSHA;
no evidence of... You get the picture. I did see lots of UN peacekeepers riding

and safety (though this seems to be people-focused only);
ensure medical care accessible; start schools at least for the
youngest children.
■ Move people who are in the settlements in the worst
geographies for flooding or practical reasons/ other
reasons (e.g., the one currently with 4000 people on the prime
minister's lawn) to pre-constructed tent settlements
elsewhere - they have built the first of these already with INGO
Shelter Box though apparently the tents were put up too close
to one another
■ Areas lacking in mention when I heard the above
discussed: a solution to ensure people have somewhere to go
when the heavy rains come; ensure continuity of key services
once the rains come; a solution to ensure people are paid how
to ensure sufficient light in the camps, clearly critical to
security (rapes are skyrocketing and I know there were at least
2 murders in one camp on Saturday night); what the right spec
of tent is for any of the above - housing, clinic, evacuation,
school and what could be multipurpose; plan for older
children/young adults who may be too old for initial school
plan; how to best support / help create where needed
settlement governance; how to census, on a semi-regular basis,
who is in the settlements
■ Over next 6-12 months:
• Assess which homes are sufficiently safe for families
to return to and subsequently encourage them to do
so; government estimates this will be —30% of all
homes/families (though this seems to be a guess, i.e., no
evidence base)
• Build semi-permanent settlements or augment pre-
existing villages around Port Au Prince where
feasible to enable the government to move people
out of settlements to those sites. End goal is to move
400-1000 families to each of these as needed
o Longer-term:
■ Rebuilt Port Au Prince though it is unclear how/if/why people
would move back or what the government's post-rebuild
vision looks like
■ Build more robust health, education etc systems than existed
before the earthquake
■ *Clearly this is the less well-defined part of the ""plan""
Context
I spent the last four days in Haiti. I was with Paul Farmer (Paul) and Partners in
Health (PIH) the entire time - in Port Au Prince Thursday, Friday and Sunday
afternoon and at PIH sites in Laconville and Cange, in the Central Plateau region
Saturday and Sunday morning. I sat in on Paul's formal meetings in Port Au Prince
with: the Haitian Minister of Health Alex Larsen and his team; the Haitian
government official ostensibly overseeing the reconstruction efforts/ UN liaison
Leslie Voltaire; a x-UN group preparing for the PDNA (post disaster needs
assessment) conference in New York at the end of March working on giving 'voice to
the voiceless,' i.e., the designated 15minutes at the conference to highlight the voices
of those most affected (the 15 minutes I gather are happening at all only because of
Cheryl and Paul), UNDP, UNHCR and others were represented; a group interested in
building a logistics center for the reconstruction efforts, i.e., outside the UN ambit,
including people from Royal Caribbean, McKinsey and the people we were traveling
with, including Wes Edens, CEO of Fortress and a supporter of PIH - and the person
who donated, and continues to donate the space at the Miami airport that PIH,
Clinton Foundation, University of Miami Medical Center and others are using to
move goods by air and sea, via transfer, to Haiti. Informally, I talked with: people in
settlements and settlement committee heads, through a translator; local Haitian
doctors; ex-pat PIH and other doctors in mobile clinics in settlements; doctors,
nurses and US police officers I ran into on the street, at dinner, at their ad hoc
residence in the abandoned Aristide Foundation; Maryse Kedar who hosted us our
nights in Port Au Prince, a member of the local elite, and her ad hoc Israel volunteers
(from the Israeli Agency for International Development Cooperation, ie their USAID,
as mentioned above); a broad swath of people serving on the USNS Comfort, both on
and off the ship; US Army enlisted and officers whenever I saw them; Louise Ivers,
head of PIH in Haiti, and others we met or ran into along the way.","['Logbase', 'US', 'Haiti', 'US', 'Port', 'Au', 'Prince', 'Cange', 'Central', 'Plateau', 'Port', 'Au', 'Prince', 'Special', 'Port', 'Au', 'Prince', 'Port', 'Au', 'Prince', ')', 'Port', 'Au', 'Prince', 'Haiti', 'Port', 'Au', 'Prince', 'Thursday', 'Laconville', 'Cange', 'Central', 'Plateau', 'Port', 'Au', 'Prince', 'New', 'York', 'Miami', 'Haiti', 'US', 'Port', 'Au', 'Prince', 'Israel', 'USAID', 'Haiti']"

Matt Finkelstein
The first bill President Obama signed after taking office was the Lilly
Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which made it easier for women to seek justice for
pay discrimination. At the time, Sens. Susan Collins (R-ME), Kay Bailey
Hutchison (R-TX) and Olympia Snowe (R-ME) joined with Democrats to
overcome strong Republican opposition to the bill.
But today, all three Republican senators voted against a motion to
proceed on the Paycheck Fairness Act, a bill that ""would further
strengthen current laws against gender-based wage discrimination."" The
motion was defeated by a vote of 58-41, falling two votes short of the 60
needed for the bill to be considered on the Senate floor.
This is not the first time the Paycheck Fairness Act has stalled in the
Senate. In 2008, the upper chamber failed to vote on the bill after it was
approved by the House, which passed the legislation again in 2009 with
the support of 10 Republicans.
Women earn barely three-quarters of what their male counterparts make
for the same work, but conservatives have invented a number of
ludicrous reasons for opposing equal pay legislation. For example, the
Heritage Foundation has suggested that equal pay laws actually hurt
women because businesses simply won't hire them if they are required to
pay them fair wages. And Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) has claimed that
women would receive better compensation if they just had more
""education and training.""",[]

H: the revenge of old Labour. Sid
0
aptember 26, 2010
John Rentoul: The party voted for David
Miliband but got the Panda instead
New Labour leader won't stand a chance against David
Cameron
The result is the worst possible for the Labour Party. A decisive victory for Ed Miliband would have been one thing. The
party would have made the wrong decision, but it would have done so with its eyes open and with the leader's legitimacy
unchallenged.
Instead, Ed Miliband lost the election in two parts of Labour's electoral college, among MPs and among Labour Party
members, but won thanks to a 60-40 margin the other way among trade union members on a very low turnout.
If he had won by a clear margin I would have said that Labour had chosen the Panda as its leader. He is soft, cuddly and
panders to every oppositional instinct in the party. There has been no position taken by the Labour government of which
he was a member that he was not prepared to trash if he thought Labour members would like it. Tuition fees, Iraq, the
third runway for Heathrow: you name it, he disowned it. Even, in the case of the third runway, a policy for which he had
direct ministerial responsibility. There has been no part of the manifesto, which he wrote, that he has not been prepared to
ditch.
But that is not what the party did. Labour Party members chose David Miliband. Labour MPs chose David. The party itself
voted for what Ed Miliband tried to dismiss as the ""New Labour Establishment"", in other words, the supposedly hated
Blairites. The party read the signals from the voters correctly. It knows that, although it didn't do as badly as it feared in the
general election, a lurch to the left was not the answer. Party members and MPs took on board Tony Blair's warning that
Labour lost because Gordon Brown ""moved a millimetre"" to the left of New Labour. They did not fall for the argument that
Labour did better than expected by moving a millimetre to the left and, therefore, to do better still they needed to move a
couple of centimetres further to the left.
They did not think that, because Labour has pulled level in the opinion polls, the next election is in the bag. They know
that the opposition party often moves ahead of the government in the opinion polls within months of an election. They also
know that Labour's poll rating is artificially inflated by the absence from the fray of the Liberal Democrats as a protest
party, and they know that this protest vote cannot be relied upon in a general election.
The Labour Party and Labour MPs got it right, and the election was won by an operation run by the trade union machines.
That means that Ed Miliband, who would have struggled against David Cameron in the House of Commons in any event,
is going to be roasted every week.
Every week, the Prime Minister is going to point out that the Leader of the Opposition does not have the support of the
members on the benches behind him. Not only that, he does not have the support of the members of his party in the
country. Every week, Cameron is going to portray Miliband as the place person of the trade union bosses and the
beneficiary of a boss-politics stitch-up.
If Ed Miliband had won the party members but lost among MPs, which is what I expected, the Conservatives would have
teased him in the Commons, but he would have had as much legitimacy as lain Duncan Smith - the choice of the party
activists against the wishes of his MPs. No wonder Ed was the ""cork-popper"" candidate in Conservative HQ. The way
things have turned out, that's not just a phrase; it would be worth lifting the austerity ban on bubbly for. David Cameron,
lucky general, faces an opponent with less of a mandate than IDS.
Even if Ed Miliband had won comfortably in all three sections of Labour's electoral college, I feel he would have struggled
against Cameron. This way, I fear that he fights with both hands tied behind his back.","['Iraq', 'Heathrow']"

7502,"Marc Grossman Article you requestedDiplomacy Before and After Conflict
By Marc Grossman
Conflict is a universal condition,' older than diplomacy. While conflict is a constant in human
history, the nature of armed conflict, and especially the nature of 21st-century warfare, has been
transformed. General Rupert Smith identified these changes in his book The Utility of Force:
""The ends for which we fight are changing; we fight amongst the people; our conflicts tend to
be timeless; we fight so as not to lose the force; on each occasion new uses are found for old
weapons; the sides are mostly non-state.""2
The nature of 21st-century diplomacy is also changing. To be successful, diplomats must
simultaneously shape, act upon, and react to global challenges. As Hans Binnendijk and
Richard Kugler of the National Defense University argue, no single problem, danger, or threat
holds the key to the world's future. What matters is their interaction and the simultaneity of our
responses.3
The definition of victory, too, is different today. Twenty-first-century national security success
will encompass a comprehensive definition of security, and will be achieved by the broadest
simultaneous application of all elements of national power. This is the key to understanding
Philip Bobbitt's concept of ""preclusive victory,"" which he describes as ""anticipatory,
precautionary attention to possible futures,"" requiring an expansive and integrated approach to
modern diplomacy, defense, and development. A diplomatic strategy designed to produce
preclusive victory will include conflict prevention, successful negotiation, deterrence, the
preparation for conflict should all else fail, and efforts to establish order, ensure stability, and
promote political and economic pluralism after conflict.
Diplomats have always been participants in both the prevention and management of conflict and
its aftermath. The conflict prevention side of diplomacy occupied much of my time at the State
Department from 1993 to 1997 as the Department's Executive Secretary and U.S. Ambassador
to Turkey. Postconflict diplomacy was a defining issue of the last third of my career at State as
Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs and as Under Secretary of State for Political
Affairs from 2001 to 2005. I have tried to draw upon my experiences and observations to
discuss here the scope and complexity of modern diplomacy, the methods and goals needed to
prevent conflict, diplomacy's role when conflict is or seems to be unavoidable, and the
contribution diplomacy can make to restoring stability following conflict.
Diplomacy and Conflict Prevention
Thanks to the efforts of scholars and practitioners, we can now make better use of the methods
and theory of conflict prevention. The United States Institute of Peace and the Woodrow
Wilson International Center for Scholars are two among many institutions that have taken a
leadership role in these efforts. Michael Lund, a practitionerscholar, notes that the present
uncoordinated and patchy nature of preventive diplomacy reflects the absence of any accepted
international conflict prevention regime or system of governance—that is, of agreed upon
arrangements through which geographic jurisdictions are allocated, functional responsibilities
are assigned, norms and procedures are formulated, and actors are held accountable for their
responsibilities.' He asks the crucial question to all those who seek to ""coordinate and
rationalize"" a system of preventive diplomacy: where should responsibility for the tasks of
preventive action be located—early warning, the decision to act, the formulation of a response,
or the provision of bureaucratic and political support? Should it be horizontal, across different
organizations or actors, or should it be vertical, up or down their chains of command?6
An example of conflict prevention that meets Lund's tests was the effort undertaken by the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), in close collaboration with the European Union
(EU) and the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, and supported by the
United States, to avoid civil war in Macedonia in 2001. It is difficult now to recall that, until
September 11, 2001, the possibility of civil war in Macedonia was a leading international
headline. This successful campaign of conflict prevention was defined by the remarkable
personal and institutional cooperation between the NATO Secretary General Lord Robertson
and the EU High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy (and a former
NATO Secretary General) Javier Solana. I spoke often during this period to Lord Robertson,
Solana, and Ambassador James Pardew, whom President George W. Bush and Secretary Colin
Powell appointed as the U.S. representative to the effort and who, along with Francois Leotard,
the EU Special Envoy, played a crucial role in negotiating and implementing the Ohrid
Framework Agreement.
As a direct participant, senior NATO official Mark Laity stated that there are insights about
modern diplomacy and conflict prevention to be drawn from this effort, including the need for
personal and institutional teamwork, the importance of early engagement in trying to head off
violence, the need to choose the right people for tasks of this kind (including 21st-century
diplomats who can act ""unconventionally""), and the necessity of being able to apply appropriate
force quickly.'
Diplomacy When Conflict Is or Seems to Be Unavoidable
When diplomacy fails to prevent conflict, the role of the diplomat changes. The new
requirement may be to justify the use of force when all efforts to avoid conflict fail or to seek to
address the underlying source of conflict when force is or seems to be inevitable and
imperative.
The February 1999 diplomatic negotiations in Rambouillet, France, were designed to show the
world that NATO and the Contact Group were willing to make one last effort to avoid using
military force to stop Slobodan Milosevic's attacks in Kosovo. I was in Rambouillet as Assistant
Secretary of State for European Affairs to support Secretary Madeleine Albright. After the first
day or so of the meeting, there was so much chaos that I urged Secretary Albright to depart
Rambouillet and leave the ""negotiating"" to those of us more junior. My strategy was that by not
being present, the Secretary of State— and the administration—could keep a distance from an
outcome that might be unacceptable to the United States. The Secretary had a different vision.
Albright hoped Rambouillet would end the brutality against the Kosovars, but she was also
prepared for the meeting to fail, and thereby all options for avoiding military conflict would be
exhausted. Her idea was that we had to be seen to be doing everything we could diplomatically,
including her continued presence, so that if Rambouillet was a failure, there could be no further
excuses against taking military action.
Secretary of State James Baker had pursued a similar strategy before the first Gulf War in 1991.
Baker relates in his memoirs, The Politics of Diplomacy, that President George H.W. Bush had
concluded the United States should offer a meeting in Washington for Iraqi Foreign Minister
Tariq Aziz followed by a Baker trip to Baghdad to show America's commitment to avoiding
war if possible. Baker writes that he thought this proposal had three merits: it would give the
administration one last diplomatic opening to avoid war; it would shore up domestic support for
conflict; and it would show that, as the deadline for Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait neared, the
administration was doing something other than just preparing for war. The President's offer
turned into the famous meeting between Baker and Aziz on January 9, 1991. As Baker recounts,
""I was under no illusions. I assumed the talks would be unsuccessful and that within a matter of
days, we would be at war.""8
In 2001-2003, the State Department leadership generally saw Iraq as a diversion from
Afghanistan and not central to the war on terror. Saddam Hussein was a dictator and a
menace— but ""in a box,"" posing no immediate, direct threat to the United States; focus should
be kept on defeating al Qaeda in Afghanistan and supporting the new Afghan government.9 Iraq
had been a source of tension and disagreement inside the State Department since the beginning
of the administration, and there were some who sought to move the policy from support for
""smart"" United Nations (UN) sanctions toward an aggressive posture against Saddam.
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger wrote in Years of Upheaval about the second term of the
Nixon administration that State Department culture emphasizes negotiability, which is a
consciousness of what the other side will accept.' Kissinger did not consider this trait a
particular positive at the time, and the department's culture of negotiability did not serve as a
good guide to institutional behavior for most of the senior State officials who participated in the
interagency debate leading to the invasion of Iraq. If that was so during the period surrounding
1970s détente with Russia, diplomatic efforts with the Shah of Iran, and the crisis in the Middle
East and the resulting 1973 war, this culture of negotiability no longer served as a good guide to
institutional behavior for most of the senior State officials who participated in the interagency
debate leading to the invasion of Iraq. We took part in planning for the conflict and its aftermath
assuming—or hoping—that events either at home or abroad would turn preparations for conflict
into successful coercive diplomacy rather than the military action that was ordered in the spring
of 2003.
The State Department's Director of Policy Planning, Richard Haass, observed that while he was
""60:40 against going to war. . . no organization could function if people left every time they
lost out on a 60:40 decision.""' Haass was operating under the belief that Iraq had weapons of
mass destruction; if he had known they did not, he says he would have been 90:10 against the
war.
And no senior Department of State officer resigned in protest. The department sought instead to
try to recreate the successful Gulf War coalition of President George H.W. Bush and argued that
the United States and its allies might compel Saddam to submit through a deployment of force
in the region in early 2003. If this failed, there should be a sustained diplomatic effort to create
a broad coalition to move militarily later in 2003. This possibility of a broad international
coalition lost all relevance on January 20, 2003, when the French government announced that it
would never support a second UN Security Council resolution to authorize the use of force in
Iraq.
Diplomacy in Preparation for Conflict
Once conflict is inevitable or is initiated, one job of diplomats is to support military
commanders in getting what they need to make conflict as short as possible, with the fewest
casualties for Americans, allies, and civilians. This was the objective that the United States
pursued in Turkey before the first Gulf War, which resulted in President Turgut Ozal's support
of American efforts. The diplomatic effort to prepare for conflict in Kosovo also involved the
whole of the U.S. Government and the governments of the NATO Allies. To pursue a
successful bombing campaign, diplomats in many NATO countries arranged for overflight and
support for Allied forces. A similar effort by U.S. diplomats took place before the invasion of
Afghanistan in 2001. American and allied diplomats worked closely with nations surrounding
Afghanistan, including forging contacts with Central Asian states on security issues for the first
time in order to achieve transit, overflight, and bed-down rights for American and coalition
forces before the October 7, 2001, beginning of action in Afghanistan.
Before the invasion of Iraq in March 2003, and especially after January 20, 2003, a similar
effort began in earnest. Diplomats supported U.S. Central Command commander General
Tommy Franks in order to make the war as short and successful as possible and to limit
American, allied, and Iraqi civilian casualties. American diplomats worked with military
commanders to seek access to facilities for U.S. forces and to participate in the public
diplomacy effort to gain as much support as possible for the armed liberation of Iraq. American
diplomats and Pentagon officials again paid particular attention to Turkey in an effort to
convince the Turks to allow the 4th Infantry Division to transit that country to create a northern
front in the battle against Saddam's forces. Although the State Department worried about the
size of the Department of Defense (DOD) request to Ankara, it worked closely with both
civilian and military authorities at the Pentagon to try to meet the need that had been identified
by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Joint DOD—State diplomacy, however, could not
overcome a negative vote in the Turkish parliament, which reflected strong public opposition to
the war.
The way the debate about using force is carried out inside the government influences attitudes
and actions during and after conflict as well as future decisions on whether or not to use force.
Military force may restore security, but it cannot resolve political or cultural sources of conflict.
As Rupert Smith writes, ""We are engaging in conflict for objectives that do not lead to a
resolution of the matter directly by force of arms, since at all but the most basic tactical level
our objectives tend to concern the intentions of the people and their leaders rather than their
territory or forces.""' Smith argues that the civil-military structure designed to make political-
military decisions is ""deeply problematic"" and distorts decisionmaking in many ways.13 In his
book, Smith imagines a debate between British Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) and
Ministry of Defense (MOD) officials about how to address the genocide taking place over a
number of weeks in Rwanda during the summer of 1994.
FCO: What can we do in the face of events in Rwanda?
MOD: What do you want us to do?
FCO: We ought to act. Something must be done. We can't have people being massacred. As a
permanent member of the UN Security Council we cannot be seen to be doing nothing.
MOD: So you want us to use military force?
FCO: Yes.
MOD: To do what? To stop the killing?
FCO: Yes. Exactly.
MOD: Who do you want us to fight? We are not clear who is doing the killing: is it tribe on
tribe, or is it a force found _from a tribe? And Rwanda is a big country. Where do we start?
Kigali, presumably, it's the capital and we would want an airhead.
FCO: Well, there must be an international force, of course.
MOD: And what would be the British aim in joining the force?
FCO: To play our part as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
MOD: Is Britain to lead the force?
FCO: No, it should be led by the UN—a proper UN mission.
MOD: That will take some time to assemble, so it will probably be too late to stop the killing.
FCO: Then the mission should be aimed at bringing postconflict order.
MOD: OK But we need to be clear how many British troops are currently available. Given our
deployments in Ireland, Bosnia and a few other places, not many.
FCO: What do you suggest?
MOD: What are our government's priorities? Is contributing to this force a higher priority than
these other tasks we are already undertaking?
FCO: Probably not.
MOD: In that case, these UN forces always lack expeditionary logistic support. And if we want
to speed up the deployment of this force, offering a logistic unit would probably be the most
valuable contribution.
FCO: Will that put our soldiers at risk?
MOD: Hardly any.""
Many American diplomats will recognize this imaginary conversation, having participated in
something like it dozens of times since the fall of the Berlin Wall. In the American debate, the
issue also quickly focuses on who pays the bills. It is worth stating, at least in the American
case, that officials at the Pentagon and DOD often were legitimately frustrated by the State
Department's inclination to promote military missions for the Pentagon and the Armed Forces
in an increasing number of situations that were important, but not vital, to U.S. national
interests. While this readiness to volunteer U.S. military forces to solve problems around the
world was a direct result of the lack of civilian capacity to do the jobs required, it leads to
understandable consternation among those in uniform.
Diplomacy and Restoring Stability Following Conflict
There are many issues—defeating extremism, promoting pluralism, bringing the benefits of
globalization to those who have not yet benefited, living sustainably on the planet,
nonproliferation— that will be part of any definition of successful 21st-century diplomacy. But
getting postconflict diplomacy right—creating the conditions for a preclusive victory—may be
the most crucial of all. This is not an easy assignment. The concept of success can be redefined
after the fact, further complicating the assessment. Successful democratic governance and
economic development cannot be delivered on a certain date, and therefore the need for time
and patience is a necessity on the ground. However, patience is limited in home countries, and
""fatigue"" often sets in. Thus, the potential for failure is high. Industrial war produced winners
and losers; today's lines are not so clearly drawn, and the timeline may be longer.
Rupert Smith again brings clarity to this assessment:
We intervene in or even decide to escalate to, a conflict in order to establish a condition in
which the political objective can be achieved by other means and in other ways. We seek to
create a conceptual space for diplomacy, economic incentives, political pressure and other
measures to create a desired political outcome of stability, and if possible democracy. . . . if a
decisive strategic victory was the hallmark of interstate industrial war, establishing a condition
may be deemed a hallmark of the new paradigm of war amongst the people.15
Smith's point can be pressed even further by recognizing the additional distinction between a
military operation carried out following Smith's rules and the ambiguity inherent in trying to
create the conditions Smith identifies as objectives. Christopher Schnaubelt has noted that a
typical military operation will have unambiguous geographic boundaries (areas of
responsibility) and will assign specific units to be responsible for every inch of ground or cubic
foot of airspace. There is an obvious chain of responsibilities and expected actions between
each individual Soldier or Marine on the ground and the commanding general. Nothing
comparable exists for economic development in governance tasks, which tend to be assigned by
function rather than local geography or rigid hierarchy of authority.16
Postconflict diplomacy was among the defining diplomatic issues of the last third of my career
at the State Department.
In the aftermath of the first Gulf War in 1991, almost 500,000 Kurds fled to the mountains
between Iraq and Turkey. Stranded in harsh conditions, they began to starve by the thousands
each day. I was then the Deputy Chief of Mission in Turkey. Inspired by the leadership of
Ambassador Morton Abramowitz, American diplomats, followed by American military forces
and then an international coalition of governments and nongovernmental organizations, initiated
Operation Provide Comfort (which became Operation Northern Watch). This was not just a
""whole-of-government"" but a ""whole-of-theinternational- community"" campaign to provide
humanitarian assistance and then return the Kurds to their homes in Northern Iraq. Once home,
they needed to be protected, and for 11 years, the United Sates and some of its allies, including
Turkey, worked on the ground there to recreate a functioning society and then protected this
area from Saddam by enforcing a no-fly zone.
These years were also punctuated by activity in the Balkans. As Richard Holbrooke recounts,
some of the pre-Dayton negotiations with Bosnian leader Alija Izetbegovi took place in my
residence while I was Ambassador to Turkey:7 As one of Holbrooke's successors as Assistant
Secretary for European Affairs, I watched the effort made by Ambassadors Robert Gelbard and
James Dobbins to implement the Dayton Accords by applying whole-of-government efforts in
postconflict post- Yugoslavia. I picked up the diplomatic thread again as Under Secretary of
State for Political Affairs promoting reconciliation, development, political progress, and
nationbuilding in Kosovo.
Other postconflict diplomacy efforts in Haiti, East Timor, and Liberia called upon the resources
of the United States and other governments to try to create the conceptual space for
development and sustained peace. The U.S. effort in Colombia, too, highlighted the need to
focus on an integrated and cross-sectoral approach, which included disarmament,
demobilization, and reintegration of former combatants and promoted justice in postconflict
society. But the main events in modern diplomacy's postconflict paradigm are Afghanistan and
Iraq.
The key to understanding U.S. diplomacy in postconflict Afghanistan and Iraq is to recall the
profound disagreement inside the U.S. Government, especially between DOD and State, about
whether the United States should engage in ""nationbuilding,"" a policy President Bush had
campaigned against in 2000. State Department professionals were generally proud of the effort
the United States had made in nationbuilding and in peacekeeping, supporting the deployment
of U.S. military forces to participate, for example, in the Multinational Force and Observers in
the Sinai and in peacekeeping and nationbuilding activities in East Timor, Haiti, and the
Balkans. Most believed that nationbuilding, properly funded and executed, was an effective
long-term tool of integrated modern diplomacy for the United States.
The effort to create a new Afghan government after the overthrow of the Taliban was a piece of
classical diplomacy carried out in the 21st-century context.'8 Secretary Powell directed
Ambassador Dobbins to support the regional negotiation hosted by the Germans in Bonn in
2001 to create a new Afghan government. To succeed, Dobbins worked with all the key players,
including representatives from Iran, to support a major role for the United Nations and put
Hamid Karzai in position to lead a new Afghanistan.' But, as Dobbins has written, the ""Bush
Administration, having overthrown the Taliban and installed a new government in Kabul,
determined that American troops would do no peacekeeping and that peacekeepers from other
countries would not be allowed to venture beyond the Kabul city limits. Public security
throughout the rest of the country would be left entirely to Afghans, despite the fact that
Afghanistan had no army and no police force.""2°
The struggle over nationbuilding also hampered American attempts to get sufficient amounts of
U.S. or international assistance to Afghanistan. Washington accepted the diffusion of
responsibility there, with the British taking charge of counternarcotics, the Italians reforming
the justice sector, and the Germans training police. This satisfied the need for burden-sharing
but did not lead to success. In addition, postconflict resources focused by the United States on
Afghanistan were small compared to other recent postconflict situations, even including
Kosovo.' American diplomats who followed Dobbins to the Embassy in Kabul over the years
faced the legacy of this lack of attention and underinvestment.22
The State Department participated at many levels in the National Security Council—led planning
for postconflict Iraq. Much of the planning was detailed, but focused on lessons learned from
the first Gulf War. The department's Future of Iraq Project, while important, would not have
solved Iraq's postwar problems. State did not have the capacity to take responsibility for the
immediate postconflict administration of Iraq, and its leadership agreed to the Executive order
creating a postconflict Iraq structure that reported to the Secretary of Defense.
There is no need here to recount the lost lives and lost opportunities so well chronicled by
others in the immediate postconflict period in Iraq, although Dobbins's argument that, looking
back, the Coalition Provisional Authority accomplished a great deal under trying circumstances
is worth noting.23 On July 1, 2004, the State Department did officially open (on time and on
budget) an Embassy in Baghdad, which allowed an expansion of diplomacy and led to more
comprehensive senior civilian-military cooperation.
There is another important lesson to draw from recent postconflict efforts: the need to have
adequate civilian capacity to respond, including a role for a revitalized U.S. Agency for
International Development (USAID). As this journal chronicled in an article' by Ambassador
John Herbst, the Secretary of State's Coordinator for Reconstruction and Stabilization (S/CRS),
his office was mandated to develop a whole-ofgovernment civilian response to stability
operations and to ensure civilian-military coordination.
The Civilian Response Corps (CRC) is in an early stage, and ultimately will be made up of a
reserve component, in addition to the existing active and standby components. The personnel
are anticipated to represent the full range of sector experts: engineers, lawyers, judges,
corrections officials, diplomats, development experts, public administrators, public health
officials, city planners, border control officials, economists, and others. Currently, the active
and standby components that are being stepped up are drawn from State, USAID, and a core
group of domestic U.S. Agencies.
Once congressionally funded, the reserves would be drawn from state and local governments
and the private sector. Between January 2008 and May 2009, 56 CRC members deployed to 11
countries, including Afghanistan for planning purposes, and there are realistic plans to have 250
active members and 1,000 standby members ready to deploy by the end of 2010. There are now
at least 14 other countries with whom the United States allies that have a civilian peacebuilding
capacity—some including stability or civilian police, and employing wholeof- government or
""comprehensive"" approaches similar to that created by Washington. Several, in fact, have
higher budgets proportionate to their gross national products than America's.25
One way for State to further support the S/CRS effort would be to consider creating a new
personnel specialty: the ""expeditionary diplomat."" Washington's diplomatic personnel have, of
course, always been in one sense expeditionary; the majority of the Foreign Service is deployed
abroad the majority of the time. But the post-9/11 diplomatic experience, and especially the
effort in Iraq and Afghanistan, means that State needs to be more explicit about the
expeditionary nature of some of its future diplomatic work and should prepare a small but
significant number of people to serve successfully in the hardest places at a moment's notice.
Experience with the Provincial Reconstruction Teams in Iraq and Afghanistan, the lessons
learned with S/CRS, and the example of diplomats who have pursued careers in the toughest
posts should lead State leadership to conclude that this is a step worth taking. The first
requirement would be advanced training, some of it provided by DOD and some by the Central
Intelligence Agency, for those entering diplomats who believe they want to pursue this special
career path. These entering officers would make an explicit choice and understand that an
investment in their extra training would require their service in hard places, just as we now ask
diplomats who take the hardest languages— Chinese or Arabic, for example—to serve more
than one tour using their skills. Since these expeditionary diplomats will not need to meet the
same age and physical requirements as special operations in the military, the State Department
could allow people to opt in and out of this ""special force"" during their careers as long as they
have the proper training. This would allow flexibility across the institution and encourage those
who desire or whose family circumstances might change over time to participate as well. The
department would also need to make sure those taking this career path are recognized for a
career beyond the norm for Foreign Service and are promoted and rewarded.
The creation of S/CRS is a symbol of the comprehensive, simultaneous diplomacy needed for
the future, and this expeditionary diplomat could form the backbone of the State and USAID
commitment to the civilian response capacity. There are still key questions to be answered
about civilian capacity. In the face of a real world situation, will DOD really support a State
Department—led operation? Will Congress adequately fund S/CRS, including a reasonable
contingency fund? How will S/CRS and a resurgent USAID work together? Where will the
lines be drawn between immediate postconflict needs and nationbuilding? There seems to be no
question that the path is the right one, consistent with the administration's focus on diplomacy,
development, and defense. Success will come with clear direction and active implementation.
If we combine the observations made by several authors,' we arrive at this question: What
national policies, supported by adequate human and financial resources, will create the
conditions during and after war to bring about a preclusive victory? Nation building, post-
conflict reconstruction and stability operations, and counterinsurgency strategy (call it what we
will) will be part of modern diplomacy for years to come. Accomplishing this task does not
have to be an exclusively American responsibility, and, indeed, one of the goals of modern
American diplomats will be to make these efforts more international. But for the foreseeable
future, the United States will need to learn the lessons of its role in nation building from
Germany to Iraq."" These lessons include support for new institutions that bring all of the
elements of power and influence together in the same theater, at the same time, and in close
coordination so the United States and its allies and friends have a chance to succeed.28 As Philip
Bobbitt has written, ""The problem is the picture of warfare to which we cling. This picture
unfolds in this way: peace making by diplomats; war making by the Armed Forces; peace
building by [US]AID and reconstruction personnel. The reality of 21st century warfare,
however, is that all of these tasks must be performed simultaneously.""'
While the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century can be observed and analyzed
individually, none of them can be solved without reference to the others. Diplomacy is not the
answer to every question, but it has utility both before and after conflict. As General Smith
writes at the end of his volume:
For the general purpose of all interventions is clear: we seek to establish in the minds of the
people and their leaders that the ever present option of conflict is not the preferable course of
action when in confrontation over some matter or another. This applies as much to the state
possessing nuclear weapons or seeking to obtain them, rogue or otherwise, as it does to the *
terrorist or the machete-wielding rebel; each is posing an armed threat to people to establish a
condition in which to achieve its political goal. To do this, military force is a valid option, a
lever of intervention and influence, as much as economic, political and diplomatic levers, but to
be effective it must be applied as apart of a greater scheme focusing all measures on the one
goal.3°
The connection to the utility of a modern diplomacy is clear. Twenty-first-century diplomacy,
working to prevent conflict, trying to get ready for it if it is inevitable, or dealing with the
consequences, can be an effective tool of national security if it is adequately funded, carried out
by well-trained, dedicated people, focused on clear goals set by national leaders, and backed by
effective military force. This is the diplomacy of the future.
The author expresses appreciation to The Cohen Group for allowing him time to consider
these issues and to the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and the
Harvard John F. Kennedy School Project on Diplomacy for supporting the effort. The
author also gratefully acknowledges the important contributions of Toni Getze, Jill
O'Donnell, and Daniel Bliss in making this article a reality.

Thanks a lot for all the good wishes you have sent via Lois. It has been one of the pleasures of the last few months to see
you going from strength to strength. And the wedding looked fantastic!
Your message on Saturday was poignant. Losing is tough. When you win the party members and MPs doubly so. (When
it's your brother...). But I am so proud of the campaign we ran, the issues we raised etc. We got people to believe in a
New Labour platform - and modernised the platform.
I have announced today that I will stay in Parliament but not in shadow cabinet.
Thanks for all your encouragement over the last couple of years. I will let you know when I am in DC.

7546,"Martin Indyk sent this to Jeff Feltman -- very interesting analysisJake probably passed this on to you, but just in case, I think it's definitely worth reading
A few comments from one of my staff members who has long experience with
the Middle East follow.
From Martin: The principle conclusion from a quick visit to Israel and Ramallah over the weekend is that
Netanyahu is in a strong position politically, with an unusually stable ruling coalition. Nobody I spoke with
believed that the government would have fallen if he had decided to extend the settlement freeze before its
expiry, as a gesture to U.S. peacemaking efforts. In their view, he could have easily garnered the support of a
large majority of the people, for whom the settlers are a marginal concern. And this would have given him
leverage over his ministers to ensure their support or abstention in the cabinet. As Dan Meridor noted, Likud
voters are to the left of their Knesset members when it comes to peacemaking (70 percent support the two-state
solution, vs only 50 percent of the leadership).
Lieberman, not the Likud, is Bibi's chief concern. He wants to keep him in the government for as long as
possible for fear that when he leaves he will garner the support of those on the right, including from the Likud,
who oppose peacemaking. For the time being, Bibi uses the threat of an alternative coalition with Kadima to
keep Lieberman in the tent. But the clock is ticking. According to Tzipi Livni, she can bring her party into the
government now, and is willing to do so without any demand for ""rotation,"" provided Bibi is serious about
negotiating peace. But as the elections grow closer, more and more of her party members are turning against
the idea of joining the government. They are strengthened in their views by recent internal polling which shows
Kadima with 32 seats (up from 28 now), Likud slightly down at 25, and Labor at only 5.
Therefore, if Bibi intends to make a deal with Abu Mazen, he will need to do so sooner rather than later. The
longer he waits, the less leverage he has on Lieberman and the more likely Lieberman will break away to
oppose him in the next elections.
In this context, Bibi's negotiating tactics become self-defeating. Believing that he is a great negotiator, and that
he is operating in the Middle East bazaar, he inflates his requirements well beyond anything reasonable in the
belief that this is the best way to secure the highest price. The process of bringing him down to a reasonable
price uses up a lot of energy, uses up a lot of goodwill, humiliates his Palestinian negotiating partner, and raises
doubts about his seriousness. In the end, under great pressure from all quarters, he will make the final
concession, but only after wasting a lot of time, making everybody furious with him, and thereby securing no
credit either with his supporters or negotiating partners. At heart, he seems to lack a generosity of spirit. This
combines with his legendary fear of being seen as a ""freier"" (sucker) in front of his people to create a real
problem in the negotiations, especially because he holds most of the cards.
This is further complicated by his introduction of the notion of ""creative ideas."" Thinking out of the box, as he
likes to do, will only further delay the negotiations because the box is already well-defined. To attempt to
broaden the parameters will generate mistrust of his intentions on the Palestinian side just when direct
negotiations provide the opportunity to build trust.
The reason for dwelling on Bibi's psychology rather than his politics is that the latter all point in the direction of
making a deal: the Israeli public is ready to get on with it; if Israel doesn't make a serious move, it will further
delegitimize its standing internationally (something Bibi is deeply concerned about); Bibi needs President
Obama in his corner to deal with the threat from Iran and to avoid punishment by the voters for mishandling
relations with the U.S.; and if he doesn't make the deal with Abu Mazen now, he will have helped to advance
the future he is most concerned about - a llamas takeover of the Palestinian leadership.
Yuval Diskin was quite clear about this latter point. After praising the Palestinian security services to the sky
(unusual for him) he told me that he had warned Bibi that at the moment they have a high motivation to prevent
terror because they believe they are building their state. If that proves to be an illusion, the motivation will
disappear and then he cannot guarantee security in the West Bank. He considers it quite possible that if Bibi
doesn't quickly demonstrate his seriousness to Abu Mazen, he will resign because his honor has now been
seriously damaged. He told Bibi that he cannot predict who will lead the Palestinians if Abu Mazen resigns, but
that Salam Fayyad will likely have to go too.
What is to be done? I have no magic solution for what must be a deeply frustrating exercise for you. And
please forgive me if what I recommend here is just repeating what you already know.
1.Put your arm around Bibi: he still thinks we are out to bring him down. There is no substitute for working
with him, even though he makes it such a frustrating process. But the purpose of embracing him is to nudge
him forward, not to buy into his exaggerated political fears or accept his inflated demands.
2. Try to find a way to make him understand that his negotiating tactics are counterproductive to his own
purposes. The Obama Administration has done a great deal lately to underscore its concern for Israel's security,
from the vote at the IAEA, to the sanctions on Iran, to the letter that Obama was willing to sign that accepted
Bibi's security requirements. That should buy you credibility with him.
3. As his friend, paint a realistic picture of the strategic consequences of his negotiating tactics, particularly in
terms of what is likely to happen to the PA leadership if he worries only about his politics and not at all about
Abu Mazen's politics.
4. If all else fails, avoid recriminations in favor of a ""clarifying moment."" The world will of course blame
Bibi. But you should avoid any kind of finger-pointing in favor of a repeated commitment to a negotiated
solution and a willingness to engage with both sides in trying to make that happen, when they're ready. The
Israeli public and the American Jewish Community should know how far the President was prepared to go and
they should be allowed to draw their own conclusions. Bibi, Abu Mazen, and the Arab states need negotiations
and time is not on the side of any of them. They will come back to the table sooner rather than later as long as
we keep the door open.

the past week on the last chapter in addition to Bill, Karen, both Jim and Don Steinberg and others at both State and
USAID), greatly aided by spectacular thinking and all-night editing from Jake, here are a much improved four chapters.
Among other things, the 4th chapter now showcases much of the great work jack and his team have already done.
In the final report we will have
1.An introductory 1-2 page letter from you
2. An exec summary (10-15 pp that can be read in lieu of entire doc)

With the edits/cuts this week we are on track to come in some 5,000-10,000 words shorter than the QDR.

vision for diplomacy
By Elise Labatt, CNN
October 27, 2010 12:51 p.m. EDT
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
• It is the first-ever undertaking for the State Department
• Approach will focus on American leadership through civilian power
• Going forward, diplomats likely to wear cargo pants as a pinstriped suit.
Washington (CNN) -- Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is outlining how she plans to redefine U.S. diplomacy and
development ahead of a top-down review which has taken place this year and will be released in the coming weeks.
In an essay in the November/December issue of Foreign Affairs, Clinton previews the Quadrennial Diplomacy and
Development Review, commonly referred to as the QDDR. The review, the first-ever such an undertaking for the
State Department, is meant to balance a similar quadrennial review by the Defense Department that projects their
strategy and priorities.
The new approach to development, Clinton says, will focus on American leadership through civilian power. Both
Clinton and Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and have talked about ""demilitarizing"" foreign policy, and Clinton
says the QDDR will suggest how to do that, with a whole new set of resources for diplomacy and development,
much of which will be geared toward fragile states in conflict or crisis.
In the article, Clinton painted the broad strokes of the document, which she called a blueprint for reforms to be
implemented over the next four years. Those reforms include modernizing and coordinating diplomacy across U.S.
government agencies, creating a stronger nexus between diplomacy and development and ensuring that
development undertaken by the U.S. has a lasting and ""sustainable"" impact.
""Economic growth is the surest route out of poverty, and expanding and strengthening middle classes around the
world will be key to creating the just and sustainable international order that lies at the heart of the United States'
national security strategy,"" Clinton wrote in Foreign Affairs. She said that the U.S. ultimate goal in development was
to ""put itself out of business"" by boosting up countries to assume responsibility for their own projects and future.
President Barack Obama laid out the vision and the basic pillars of the policy in September at the United Nations
General Assembly when he released the ""U.S. Global Development Policy,"" which changes U.S. efforts to focus on
building up countries that demonstrate good governance and economic potential.
But the QDDR will outline how to put that policy into practice. Officials say the 150-page document will detail
everything from how the United States conducts multilateral diplomacy, how the United States undertakes
""stabilization"" efforts in post-conflict areas, how the State Department works with USAID and contractors to the
types and numbers of personnel needed to implement the new approach.
American diplomats going forward, Clinton said, are as likely to wear cargo pants as a pinstriped suit.","['Washington', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'U.S.', 'United', ""States'"", 'U.S.', 'U.S', 'U.S.', 'United', 'States', 'United', 'States']"

Wiki Leaks Accidentally Helps U.S.
by Leslie H. Gelb
November 30, 2010 I 10:42pm
Julian Assange clearly intended the State Dept. cable leaks to smear the U.S. as evil and selfish. Leslie
H. Gelb on how he inadvertently proved the opposite.
The Wikileakers dumped a vast pile of secrets to prove that the United States was selfish, stupid and wicked—but their
revelations proved just the opposite. When you remove the gossip and obvious trivia that mesmerized the press, you
clearly see what the Wikileakers never expected: A United States seriously and professionally trying to solve the most
dangerous problems in a frighteningly complicated world, yet lacking the power to dictate solutions. U.S. policymakers
and diplomats are shown, quite accurately, doing what they are supposed to do: ferreting out critical information from
foreign leaders, searching for paths to common action, and struggling with the right amount of pressure to apply on allies
and adversaries. And in most cases, the villain is not Washington, but foreign leaders escaping common action with
cowardice and hypocrisy.
Don't think for a New York minute that Julian Assange, the Wikileaker, unloaded this trove to save humankind. Why did he
toss in those cables about Italy's leader being a rake and Germany's chancellor being a cautious fuddy-duddy, and
President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan being ""paranoid""? To save the world? Not a chance. He did it to get attention, and
he got attention from a drooling press, which then went on to call the very material they were highlighting trivial. Did
Assange leak critical conversations with Chinese or Arab leaders to help solve the problems in Korea and Iran? Not by the
hair on your chinny chin chin. He did it to show that he could do it—and for the attention. Anyone who is not a hopeless
left-wing ideologue knows that such leaks will crush future serious conversations with those leaders for some time to
come. Just think: if you told someone a serious and critical confidence about someone else, and your confidant went out
and told others, would you soon repeat that mistake? Assange did not leak these cables to help solve world problems.
These leaks were absolutely gratuitous and served only the purpose of making him a media marvel.
When you actually read the cables, here's what you see: American leaders and American diplomats trying to solve crucial
world In explaining his deed publicly, Assange suggests that what he's doing is uncovering American misdeeds and lies.
His aim, he says, is to inform citizens of democracies and peoples around the world about what their leaders are really
doing. Assange also insists he did this for transparency's sake. Yet when he got to look inside, he didn't see what was
plain: that our diplomats were doing a good job. Indeed, when you turn off his nonsense and stop listening to the strange
commentary on cable news and even on the front pages of great newspapers, when you actually read the cables, here's
what you see: American leaders and American diplomats trying to solve crucial world problems.
But when you turn off his nonsense and stop listening to the strange commentary on cable news and even on the front
pages of great newspapers, when you actually read the cables, here's what you see: American leaders and American
diplomats trying to solve crucial world problems.
—Washington needs China's help in bolstering sanctions against Iran, and China balks for fear of jeopardizing its oil and
gas flow from that country. The Obama team arranges for Saudi Arabia to guarantee any loss in supply to China. If the
world wants to slow or even prevent Iran's march to nuclear weaponry, this is a key path to doing so.
—
The U.S. discovers that North Korea has manufactured new medium-range missiles and is trying to deliver them to Iran
through China. The Obama team discovers this, informs Beijing, and asks Beijing to stop the transfer. Beijing declines.
Really creepy.
—
Yemen's leader takes public responsibility for American missile attacks against Al Qaeda in Yemen. He wants to
diminish the power of these terrorists, as do Americans and most others in the world. The ""lie"" by the Yemeni president is
a harmless way to get a critical job done—that is, the job of fighting international terrorism. Wikileaks tears away the
political cover of Yemen's leaders.
—No country has anywhere near as much influence over nutty North Korea as China. So, U.S. diplomats are searching
desperately to figure out Chinese thinking about North Korea in order to compose a plan for avoiding war on the Korean
Peninsula. So, the Wikileakers expose some Chinese leaders who are actually trying to give us some insight into Chinese
thinking about North Korean craziness. They won't do that again soon.
Time and again, as one actually reads these cables, one has to be heartened by the professionalism and the insights of
U.S. diplomats. What are they doing? They are not lying, and U.S. leaders are not lying. They are actually, believe it or
not, trying to solve problems. That seriousness of purpose and the professionalism to execute it is what jumps out at you
in these materials.
So, the naïve say, it's good to show the effectiveness of our diplomats. Give me a break. Ask any American diplomat to
choose between looking intelligent in leaked cables and making progress toward avoiding war.
None of this is to say that there should not be leaks, or that the press should not pursue classified information that is
necessary or very helpful to a sensible public debate on policy. If a U.S. administration is lying, or distorting the facts, or
telling one story to the public and another to itself, then by all means, let's have it out in public. If the U.S. government is
concocting intelligence in order to justify wars, let's hope an enterprising reporter finds it out for the rest of us.
But the Wikileaks dump is not about providing essential information to Americans or to others—information they need for
serious policy discussion. This massive trashing by Wikileaks of a legitimate effort by the U.S. government to preserve
confidentiality is the very least a shame and at the most, a crime.

The Republican case for ratifying New START
bn)://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/12/01/AR2010120104598.html?hpid=topnews
By Henry A. Kissinger, George P. Shultz, James A. Baker III, Lawrence S. Eagleburger and Colin L. Powell
Thursday, December 2, 2010;
Republican presidents have long led the crucial fight to protect the United States against nuclear dangers. That
is why Presidents Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush negotiated the SALT I, START I and
START II agreements. It is why President George W. Bush negotiated the Moscow Treaty. All four recognized
that reducing the number of nuclear arms in an open, verifiable manner would reduce the risk of nuclear
catastrophe and increase the stability of America's relationship with the Soviet Union and, later, the Russian
Federation. The world is safer today because of the decades-long effort to reduce its supply of nuclear weapons.
As a result, we urge the Senate to ratify the New START treaty signed by President Obama and Russian
President Dmitry Medvedev. It is a modest and appropriate continuation of the START I treaty that expired
almost a year ago. It reduces the number of nuclear weapons that each side deploys while enabling the United
States to maintain a strong nuclear deterrent and preserving the flexibility to deploy those forces as we see fit.
Along with our obligation to protect the homeland, the United States has responsibilities to allies around the
world. The commander of our nuclear forces has testified that the 1,550 warheads allowed under this treaty are
sufficient for all our missions - and seven former nuclear commanders agree. The defense secretary, the
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the head of the Missile Defense Agency - all originally appointed by a
Republican president - argue that New START is essential for our national defense.
We do not make a recommendation about the exact timing of a Senate ratification vote. That is a matter for the
administration and Senate leaders. The most important thing is to have bipartisan support for the treaty, as
previous nuclear arms treaties did.
Although each of us had initial questions about New START, administration officials have provided reasonable
answers. We believe there are compelling reasons Republicans should support ratification.
First, the agreement emphasizes verification, providing a valuable window into Russia's nuclear arsenal. Since
the original START expired last December, Russia has not been required to provide notifications about changes
in its strategic nuclear arsenal, and the United States has been unable to conduct on-site inspections. Each day,
America's understanding of Russia's arsenal has been degraded, and resources have been diverted from national
security tasks to try to fill the gaps. Our military planners increasingly lack the best possible insight into
Russia's activity with its strategic nuclear arsenal, making it more difficult to carry out their nuclear deterrent
mission.
Second, New START preserves our ability to deploy effective missile defenses. The testimonies of our military
commanders and civilian leaders make clear that the treaty does not limit U.S. missile defense plans. Although
the treaty prohibits the conversion of existing launchers for intercontinental and submarine-based ballistic
missiles, our military leaders say they do not want to do that because it is more expensive and less effective than
building new ones for defense purposes.
Finally, the Obama administration has agreed to provide for modernization of the infrastructure essential to
maintaining our nuclear arsenal. Funding these efforts has become part of the negotiations in the ratification
process. The administration has put forth a 10-year plan to spend $84 billion on the Energy Department's
nuclear weapons complex. Much of the credit for getting the administration to add $14 billion to the originally
proposed $70 billion for modernization goes to Sen. Jon Kyl, the Arizona Republican who has been vigilant in
this effort. Implementing this modernization program in a timely fashion would be important in ensuring that
our nuclear arsenal is maintained appropriately over the next decade and beyond.
Although the United States needs a strong and reliable nuclear force, the chief nuclear danger today comes not
from Russia but from rogue states such as Iran and North Korea and the potential for nuclear material to fall
into the hands of terrorists. Given those pressing dangers, some question why an arms control treaty with Russia
matters. It matters because it is in both parties' interest that there be transparency and stability in their strategic
nuclear relationship. It also matters because Russia's cooperation will be needed if we are to make progress in
rolling back the Iranian and North Korean programs. Russian help will be needed to continue our work to
secure ""loose nukes"" in Russia and elsewhere. And Russian assistance is needed to improve the situation in
Afghanistan, a breeding ground for international terrorism.
Obviously, the United States does not sign arms control agreements just to make friends. Any treaty must be
considered on its merits. But we have here an agreement that is clearly in our national interest, and we should
consider the ramifications of not ratifying it.
Whenever New START is brought up for debate, we encourage all senators to focus on national security. There
are plenty of opportunities to battle on domestic political issues linked to the future of the American economy.
With our country facing the dual threats of unemployment and a growing federal debt bomb, we anticipate
significant conflict between Democrats and Republicans. It is, however, in the national interest to ratify New
START.

American Diplomacy Revealed as Good
By ROGER COHEN
NEW YORK — Let's hear it for the men and women of the U.S. Foreign Service!
They are, to judge from the WikiLeaks dump of a quarter-million of their private or secret cables, thoughtful, well-informed
and dedicated servants of the American interest who write clear, declarative English sentences.
I've not heard much in the torrent of Wiki-chatter about these admirable career diplomats whose diplomacy is now
condemned to be unquiet. Yet it is they whose lives have been upturned. Every journalist knows that if their
correspondence over several years was suddenly made public, they would lose most of their sources. That should give
every journalist pause.
So it will be on the front line of U.S. diplomacy. Contacts will self-censor. They will go quiet, particularly in the more
conspiratorial parts of the world which also tend to be the most unstable, like the Middle East. Layers of secrecy will be
added.
Julian Assange, the thin-skinned founder of WikiLeaks, has hurt U.S. interests across a broad but probably shallow
spectrum. That will satisfy him in that he's a self-styled foe of the United States. The guy makes me queasy.
Perhaps the most shocking thing about the Assange treasure trove — beyond the ""shock"" of venal Gulf Arab Sunni
leaders looking for war on the cheap against Shiite Iran so long as it doesn't disrupt their U.S.-armed fiefdoms; or the
""shock"" of Pakistani double-dealing and nuclear procrastination; or the ""shock"" of yet more premature Israeli predictions
on when Iran will have a nuclear weapon; or the ""shock"" of continued Saudi funding of Al Qaeda; or the ""shock"" of the
Chinese Politburo hacking into Google; or the ""shock"" of Muammar el-Qaddafi's taste for voluptuous Slavic women and
Silvio Berlusconi's taste for all women — perhaps the biggest shock of all is just how professional, sober and short on
embarrassment all these cables are and just how much they conform with the world as we already knew it, right down to
the familiar adjectives evoking French President Nicolas Sarkozy: ""hyperactive,"" ""mercurial,"" ""authoritarian,"" ""erratic,""
""monarch-like.""
I swear, if they hadn't become diplomats a lot of these State Department people could have become good hacks.
Overall, my longstanding admiration for America's conscientious diplomats has been redoubled, not least for this
underreported nugget on the turbulent Iranian election of 2009, contained in a cable of Jan. 12, 2010, from Dubai: ""While
we don't know nor might not ever know the real June 12 vote count, it is clear that the turnout was at record high levels
and that there was systematic vote count fraud (if in fact the votes were even counted) to ensure that Ahmadinejad 'won
big' in the first round.""
It is good to know that this is the innermost conviction of American diplomacy: the fraud was evident to anyone in Tehran
during the election and its violent aftermath.
A couple more observations on Iran: The first is that the Sunni autocrats of the Gulf are as exercised as they are about
Tehran in part because they know that any U.S.-Iranian breakthrough might make them more dispensable to the United
States. Their vested interest in the prevailing Middle Eastern strategic equation is strong; nothing would redraw the Middle
East more than overcoming the U.S.-Iranian psychosis.
The second is that President Barack Obama's approach to Iran has been much more conventional than his initial outreach
suggested. Old habits of attempted coercion trumped originality. Very quickly he fell back on Dennis Ross's tired thinking
about balancing ""appetizing carrots"" with ""sharp sticks"" in tackling Iran's nuclear program.
The cables reveal that as early as March 2009, a senior U.S. diplomat was talking ""dual track,"" telling Europeans that
""engagement alone is unlikely to succeed"" and calling for added ""pressure."" Perhaps Iranian skepticism could never have
been overcome; certainly this approach guaranteed longstanding Iranian grievances would fester.
Assange himself clearly understands nothing of Iran or the Middle East or diplomacy. In an interview with Time, he
expressed approval for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ""coming out with a very interesting statement that
leaders should speak in public like they do in private whenever they can"" and bought into Netanyahu's view that this, in
Assange's words, would ""lead to some kind of increase in the peace process in the Middle East and particularly in relation
to Iran.
It
Huh? Netanyahu was referring to Arab leaders' now-documented private calls for a U.S.-led war against Iran, an option he
also favors. And that, for Assange, is a step forward to peace! He's all over the place.
What should we make of this brainy naïf who told my colleague John Burns that America is a threat to democracy? He's a
loose canon; let him be. My impression is he's self-armed with a spade and he's digging.
And what of the messenger's message? The cables are intriguing, offering plenty of voyeuristic titillation but no gasp of
discovery. They provide texture but break little new ground. Yet their publication has done significant damage to the
courageous work of America's diplomats and may endanger lives. That's a tradeoff that I find troubling and unpersuasive.","['U.S.', 'U.S.', 'Middle', 'East', 'U.S.', 'United', 'States', 'Iran', 'America', 'Dubai', 'Tehran', 'Iran', 'Gulf', 'Tehran', 'United', 'States', 'Middle', 'East', 'Iran', 'Iran', 'U.S.', 'Iran', 'Middle', 'East', 'Middle', 'East', 'Iran', 'Iran', 'America', 'America']"

H: Kathleen on Palin on JFK. Sid

Sarah Palin is wrong about John F. Kennedy, religion and
politics
By Kathleen Kennedy Townsend
Friday, December 3, 2010; 6:00 PM
Sarah Palin has found a new opponent to debate: John F. Kennedy.
In her new book, ""America by Heart,"" Palin objects to my uncle's famous 1960 speech to the Greater Houston Ministerial
Association, in which he challenged the ministers - and the country - to judge him, a Catholic presidential candidate, by
his views rather than his faith. ""Contrary to common newspaper usage, I am not the Catholic candidate for president,""
Kennedy said. ""I am the Democratic Party's candidate for president who happens also to be a Catholic.""
Palin writes that when she was growing up, she was taught that Kennedy's speech had ""succeeded in the best possible
way: It reconciled public service and religion without compromising either."" Now, however, she says she has revisited the
speech and changed her mind. She finds it ""defensive . . . in tone and content"" and is upset that Kennedy, rather than
presenting a reconciliation of his private faith and his public role, had instead offered an ""unequivocal divorce of the two.""
Palin's argument seems to challenge a great American tradition, enshrined in the Constitution, stipulating that there be no
religious test for public office. A careful reading of her book leads me to conclude that Palin wishes for precisely such a
test. And she seems to think that she, and those who think like her, are qualified to judge who would pass and who would
not.
If there is no religious test, then there is no need for a candidate's religious affiliation to be ""reconciled."" My uncle urged
that religion be private, removed from politics, because he feared that making faith an arena for public contention would
lead American politics into ill-disguised religious warfare, with candidates tempted to use faith to manipulate voters and
demean their opponents.
Kennedy cited Thomas Jefferson to argue that. as part of the American tradition, it was essential to keep any semblance
of a religious test out of the political realm. Best to judge candidates on their public records, their positions on war and
peace, jobs, poverty, and health care. No one, Kennedy pointed out, asked those who died at the Alamo which church
they belonged to.
But Palin insists on evaluating and acting as an authority on candidates' faith. She faults Kennedy for not ""telling the
country how his faith had enriched him."" With that line, she proceeds down a path fraught with danger - precisely the path
my uncle warned against when he said that a president's religious views should be ""neither imposed by him upon the
nation or imposed by the nation upon him as a condition to holding that office.""
After all, a candidate's faith will matter most to those who believe that they have the right to serve as arbiters of that faith.
Is it worthy? Is it deep? Is it reflected in a certain ideology?
Palin further criticizes Kennedy because, ""rather than spelling out how faith groups had provided life-changing services
and education to millions of Americans, he repeatedly objected to any government assistance to religious schools."" She
does not seem to appreciate that Kennedy was courageous in arguing that government funds should not be used in
parochial schools, despite the temptation to please his constituents. Many Catholics would have liked the money. But he
wisely thought that the use of public dollars in places where nuns explicitly proselytized would be unconstitutional. Tax
money should not be used to persuade someone to join a religion.
As a contrast to Kennedy's speech, Palin cites former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney's remarks during the 2008
Republican primary campaign, in which he spoke publicly of ""how my own faith would inform my presidency, if I were
elected."" After paying lip service to the separation of church and state, Romney condemned unnamed enemies ""intent on
establishing a new religion in America - the religion of secularism.""
""There is one fundamental question about which I am often asked,"" Romney said. ""What do I believe about Jesus Christ?""
Romney, of course, is a Mormon. He answered the question, proclaiming that ""Jesus Christ is the son of God.""
Palin praises Romney for delivering a ""thoughtful speech that eloquently and correctly described the role of faith in
American public life."" But if there should be no religious test in politics, then why should a candidate feel compelled to
respond to misplaced questions about his belief in Jesus?
When George Romney, Mitt Romney's father, was a presidential candidate in 1968, he felt no such compulsion. Respect
for the Constitution and the founders' belief in the separation of church and state suggests that those kinds of questions
should not play a role in political campaigns.
Palin contends that Kennedy sought to ""run away from religion."" The truth is that my uncle knew quite well that what made
America so special was its revolutionary assertion of freedom of religion. No nation on Earth had ever framed in law that
faith should be of no interest to government officials. For centuries, European authorities had murdered and tortured those
whose religious beliefs differed from their own.
To demand that citizens display their religious beliefs attacks the very foundation of our nation and undermines the
precise reason that America is exceptional.
Palin's book makes clear just how dangerous her proposed path can be. Not only does she want people to reveal their
beliefs, but she wants to sit in judgment of them if their views don't match her own. For instance, she criticizes Rep. Nancy
Pelosi (Calif.), a Democrat and a faithful Catholic, for ""talking the (God) talk but not walking the walk.""
Who is Palin to say what God's ""walk"" is? Who anointed her our grand inquisitor?
This is a woman who also praises Abraham Lincoln's Second Inaugural, even though Lincoln explicitly declared, ""But let
us judge not that we not be judged."" The problem for those setting up a free-floating tribunal to evaluate faith is that,
contrary to Lincoln, they are installing themselves as judges who can look into others' souls and assess their worthiness.
Kennedy did not and would not do that, but not because he was indifferent to faith. In fact, unlike Romney or Palin, in
fealty to both his faith and the Constitution, he promised on that day in Houston that he would resign if his religion ever
interfered with his duty as president.
My uncle was a man who had his faith tested. His brother and brother-in-law were killed in World War II, and his sister
died in a plane crash soon after the war. He suffered from painful injuries inflicted during his Navy service when his PT
boat was cut in two by a Japanese destroyer. His God did not make life easy but did require a commitment to justice.
America's first and oniy Catholic president referred to God three times in p_;.-:
.:1,rai.adc'res and invoked the Bible's
command to care for poor and the sick. Later in his presidency, 1.-.a ur;:•:-.1uvocaliv. about riohi:s: We are
confronted primarily with a moral issue. It is as old as the Scriptures and is as clear as the American Constitution.""
Faith runs as a deep current through my family. Faith inspired my uncles' and my father's dedication to justice. My father,
Robert F. Kennedy, on returning from apartheid-era South Africa in 1966, wrote a magazine article titled ""Suppose God Is -
Black."" And my uncle Teddy fought for health care for all Americans, even if in her book }Dalin presumes to judge that he
took positions ""directly at odds with his Catholic faith.""
Teddy Kennedy believed that his stands were at one with his faith. He did disagree with the Roman Catholic hierarchy at
times. But as we have seen, the hierarchy's positions can change, and in our church, we have an obligation to help bring
about those changes. That may not be Palin's theology, but the glory of America is its support for those who would
disagree - even on the most difficult and personal matters, such as religion.
John F. Kennedy knew that tearing down the wall separating church and state would tempt us toward self-righteousness
and contempt for others. That is one reason he delivered his Houston speech.
Palin, for her part, argues that ""morality itself cannot be sustained without the support of religious beliefs."" That statement
amounts to a wholesale attack on countless Americans, and no study or reasonable argument I have seen or heard would
support such a blanket condemnation. For a person who claims to admire Lincoln, Palin curiously ignores his injunction
that Americans, even those engaged in a Civil War, show ""malice toward none, with charity for ail.""
Pal in fails to understand the genius of our nation. The United States is one of the most vibrant religious countries on Earth
precisely because of its religious freedom. When power and faith are entwined, faith loses. Power tends to obfuscate,
corrupt and focus on temporal rather than eternal purposes.
Somehow Palin misses this. Perhaps she didn't read the full Houston speech; she certainly doesn't know it by heart. Or
she may be appealing to a religious right that really seeks secular power. I don't know.
I am certain, however, that no American political leader should cavalierly - or out of political calculation - dismiss the hard-
won ideal of religious freedom that is among our country's greatest gifts to the world. As John F. Kennedy said in Houston,
that is the ""kind of America I believe in.""

WASHINGTON—In the first major policy fallout from the WikiLeaks disclosures, the State Department has ordered all
U.S. diplomats to ""cease and desist telling the truth until further notice.""
""We are working overtime to fly to make sure that leaks like these don't happen again,"" Secretary of State Hillary Clinton
told reporters. ""But until we've got the leaks plugged, it's incumbent on all our diplomats to put on their lying caps.""
Clinton noted that since many U.S. diplomats are major political donors with long careers in the business world, ""this
shouldn't be a reach for them."" But for those career diplomats who came up through the Foreign Service, the State
Department will be holding a series of ""truth avoidance seminars,"" led by executives of Goldman Sachs.
Additionally, Clinton said, the State Department would install on all diplomats' computers new software called
CandorShield', which automatically translates truthful language into a less embarrassing truth-free version. For
example, she explained, the software would translate the phrase ""two-faced weasels"" into ""trusted Pakistani allies"" and
would delete all references to French President Nicolas Sarkozy as ""Monsieur Shorty Pants.""

New Start: Ratify, With Caveats
The treaty helpfully reinstates on-site verification of Russian nuclear forces, but senators should make it clear to
Moscow that they don't see it as limiting U.S. missile defenses.
By CONDOLEEZZA RICE
When U.S. President Bush and Russian President Putin signed the Moscow Treaty in 2002, they addressed the nuclear
threat by reducing offensive weapons,-as their predecessors had. But the Moscow Treaty was different. It came in the
wake of America's 2001 withdrawal from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty of 1972, and for the first time the United States
and Russia reduced their offensive nuclear weapons with no agreement in place that constrained missile defenses.
Breaking the link between offensive force reductions and limits on defense marked a key moment in the establishment
of a new nuclear agenda no longer focused on the Cold War face-off between the Warsaw Pact and NATO. The real
threat was that the world's most dangerous weapons could end up in the hands of the world's most dangerous
regimes—or of terrorists who would launch attacks more devastating than 9/11. And since those very rogue states also
pursued ballistic missiles, defenses would (alongside offensive weapons) be integral to the security of the United States
and our allies.
It is in this context that we should consider the potential contribution of the New Start treaty to U.S. national security.
The treaty is modest, reducing offensive nuclear weapons to 1,550 on each side—more than enough for deterrence.
While the treaty puts limits on launchers, U.S. military commanders have testified that we will be able to maintain a
triad of bombers, submarine-based delivery vehicles and land-based delivery vehicles. Moreover, the treaty helpfully
reinstates on-site verification of Russian nuclear forces, which lapsed with the expiration of the original Start treaty last
year.
Meaningful verification was a significant achievement of Presidents Reagan and George H.W. Bush, and its
reinstatement is crucial.
Still, there are legitimate concerns about New Start that must and can be addressed in the ratification process and, if the
treaty is ratified, in future monitoring of the Obama administration's commitments.
First, smaller forces make the modernization of our nuclear infrastructure even more urgent. Sen. Jon Kyl of Arizona has
led a valiant effort in this regard. Thanks to his efforts, roughly $84 billion is being allocated to the Department of
Energy's nuclear weapons complex. Ratifying the treaty will help cement these commitments, and Congress should fully
fund the president's program.
Congress should also support the Defense Department in modernizing our launchers as suggested in the recent defense
strategy study coauthored by former Secretary of Defense Bill Perry and former National Security Adviser Stephen
Hadley.
Second, the Senate must make absolutely clear that in ratifying this treaty, the U.S. is not re-establishing the Cold War
link between offensive forces and missile defenses. New Start's preamble is worrying in this regard, as it recognizes the
""interrelationship"" of the two. Administration officials have testified that there is no link, and that the treaty will not
limit U.S. missile defenses. But Congress should ensure that future Defense Department budgets reflect this.
Moscow contends that only current U.S. missile-defense plans are acceptable under the treaty. But the U.S. must remain
fully free to explore and then deploy the best defenses—not just those imagined today. That includes pursuing both
potential qualitative breakthroughs and quantitative increases.
I have personally witnessed Moscow's tendency to interpret every utterance as a binding commitment. The Russians
need to understand that the U.S. will use the full-range of American technology and talent to improve our ability to
intercept and destroy the ballistic missiles of hostile countries.
Russia should be reassured by the fact that its nuclear arsenal is far too sophisticated and large to be degraded by our
missile defenses. In addition, the welcome agreements on missile-defense cooperation reached in Lisbon recently
between NATO and Russia can improve transparency and allow Moscow and Washington to work together in this field.
After all, a North Korean or Iranian missile is not a threat only to the United States, but to international stability broadly.
Ratification of the treaty also should not be sold as a way to buy Moscow's cooperation on other issues. The men in the
Kremlin know that loose nukes in the hands of terrorists—some who operate in Russia's unstable south—are dangerous.
That alone should give our governments a reason to work together beyond New Start and address the threat from
tactical nuclear weapons, which are smaller and more dispersed, and therefore harder to monitor and control. Russia
knows too that a nuclear Iran in the volatile Middle East or the further development of North Korea's arsenal is not in its
interest. Russia lives in those neighborhoods. That helps explain Moscow's toughening stance toward Tehran and its
longstanding concern about Pyongyang.
The issue before the Senate is the place of New Start in America's future security. Nuclear weapons will be with us for a
long time.
After this treaty, our focus must be on stopping dangerous proliferators—not on further reductions in the U.S. and
Russian strategic arsenals, which are really no threat to each other or to international stability.
A modern but smaller nuclear arsenal and increasingly sophisticated defenses are the right bases for U.S. nuclear
security (and that of our allies) going forward. With the right commitments and understandings, ratification of the New
Start treaty can contribute to this goal. If the Senate enters those commitments and understandings into the record of
ratification, New Start deserves bipartisan support, whether in the lame-duck session or next year.

G.O.P. Support for Arms Treaty
By
PETER BAKER
Another Republican senator signaled Tuesday that he may vote for the new arms control treaty with Russia if it comes
up for a vote before the Senate adjourns for the year later this month.
Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, who did not run for re-election, said he hopes that the Senate will get a chance
to vote on the treaty, known as New Start, right after a deal on tax cuts and a spending resolution to keep the
government operating.
""Start is an important issue. It should be fully debated. I am leaning towards supporting it,"" he told Andrea Mitchell on
MSNBC. ""I haven't made a final decision,"" he added, noting that Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona, the lead Republican
negotiator on the treaty, still has concerns. ""He has some reservations, but I believe many of those reservations are
being addressed,"" Mr. Gregg said.
President Obama has made passing the treaty his top foreign policy priority for the lame-duck session. Under the
Constitution, approving a treaty requires a two-thirds super-majority, or 67 votes, meaning that Mr. Obama needs nine
Republicans assuming all 58 Democrats stick with him.

December 23, 2010
•
;izaibeth O w
Of course Obama should have gotten out of Washington more and listened to people, not just talked at them; and, as
Walter Mondale said recently, he should have gotten rid of ""those idiot boards""—the TelePrompters on which the great
orator has been strangely dependent and which divide him from his audiences. Last year, a friend of mine was invited to a
Hanukkah party that the Obamas gave for prominent Jews (a group with whom there had been tensions), and after the
Obamas descended the grand stairway, they stood in the foyer briefly; the President made a few remarks and shook a
few hands, and back up the stairs they went. No mingling.
In their first two years, the Obamas have seemed a bit tone-deaf: there were too many vacations while people were
hurting, especially Michelle's extravagant trip to Spain. (I'm as interested in Michelle's clothes as the next woman but at
the same time think she and her staff are too focused on her looking smashing, which she does. Her wardrobe seems
quite extensive for these troubled times.)
Barack Obama's personality has been much mulled over in the past two years, but it seems inescapable that his high self-
esteem often slides over the thin line to arrogance, which trickles down (with some exceptions) to much of his staff, some
of whom are downright rude to all but a chosen few. °barna has seemed uninterested in anyone but his immediate group,
and three of the four members of his immediate circle--Jarrett, Robert Gibbs, David Axelrod—had had no experience in
governing. The fourth, Rahm Emanuel, expressed himself with such flippancy, arrogance, and overuse of the F-word that
he offended not just members of Congress but also would-be allies of the President.
Vice President Joe Bider), who is liked on Capitol Hill, was virtually shut out of the dealings with people in Congress in the
first two years—""I can handle them,"" Obama told Biden—but Biden is now expected to be given a larger role as part of the
White House's new determination to ""reach out."" (A few months ago highly placed members of the staff also swore they
would ""reach out,"" but that seemed to last for just a few days.) One of the oddest aspects of Obama's persona is that
someone who seems so confident has insisted thus far in having people around him with whom he is said to be
""comfortable.""
For example, Torn Donilon, his recently appointed national security adviser (a promotion from his role as deputy), is by all
accounts a capable man but is no one's idea of a serious strategic thinker. The explanation I was given for Donilon's
being given his new position was that ""the President is comfortable with him."" Just as Obama is described as pleased with
himself, he has been treated with hero worship by much of his staff. After all, he had taken on the formidable Clintons,
and, against the expectation of almost all the pundits and the experts, he had beaten them. Why should he listen to those
who had doubted him? A common complaint about the Obama White House in the first two years has been that there
were no ""grown-ups"" around, people who knew more about governing and who would tell Obama that he was wrong.
When people tried to suggest someone who should be brought in, that person was rejected as ""not one of ours."" Joe
Biden is said to argue with Obama on issues, such as Afghanistan, but not to get into the management of the White
House....
Those who supported Obama in 2008 expected him to be able to move public opinion, to get people to follow him. The
fact that the Obama White House has been so poor at ""messaging"" baffles even his strongest supporters. In fact, he had
no overall message. As Winston Churchill put it, there was no theme to his pudding. When I asked a White House aide
about this, he pointed to what had been billed as a ""major speech on the economy,"" at Georgetown University in April
2009. But the speech was utterly forgettable—and forgotten. One ally attributes this problem to the inexperience of both
Obama and his top staff. An ally says, ""You can't leave a message if you don't have a strategy and you don't know where
you're going."" Another says, ""They had something that worked in the campaign but didn't work in the White House.""
Thus, Obama didn't see the need to explain what he was doing. His 2010 campaign themes seemed to wander all over
the place: Stanley Greenberg, a pollster and former aide to Bill Clinton, said that Obama's oft-used theme, that we
shouldn't go back to the Bush days, actually tested negatively, because people didn't believe that the country was making
economic, progress.
So Obama's biggest failure was not to be the leader that so many expected him to be. The jubilation that surrounded his
swearing-in may have gone to his head, while the celebrants overlooked that there were plenty of people out there who
were not overjoyed at the advent of a black president, or even a Democrat. Obama was, apparently in his own estimation,
so smart and so adored that he seems to have felt no need to explain—and explain again—to the country what he was
doing and to take the country along with him. This failure to put his programs across came up a few times in the 2010
campaign....
More than once, people in town hall meetings told him that they were behind him but were having great trouble trying to
defend or explain his agenda. In a backyard gathering on October 21 he made the most awkward reply of those I heard:
""Our attitude was that we just had to get the policies right and we didn't always think about making sure we got the
advertising properly about what was going on."" Advertising. (When I mentioned this to a Democratic senator who was
generally supportive of Obama, this ordinarily polite man responded, ""Bullocks! What policies?"")
The risk-averse Obama had left it to Congress to write the big bills such as on the economic stimulus and health care
(with strong participation by White House aides). But he kept up this line of defense all the way through to his pathetic
press conference on the day after the election. In these comments, Obama gave away the devastating fact that he didn't
really understand the role of the president as leader. A friend of the Obama administration said to me, ""Their definition of
governing is passing bills."" Someone else relatively close to the White House explained that since Obama had been so
criticized for being ""arrogant"" and ""aloof,"" he had to eat large portions of humble pie. (""And I take responsibility for that,""
Obama said again and again.)","['Washington', 'Spain', 'Afghanistan']"

The Cancun Agreements
Over the last year, the United States has worked with our international partners to build on the progress achieved at the
climate change conference in Copenhagen. We have pressed for substantive steps that would advance the vision of the
Copenhagen Accord. This month we joined the nations of the world in Cancun for a new round of talks aimed at
mobilizing common action to meet the shared global challenge of climate change.
Today I am pleased to announce that we secured the Cancun Agreements, a set of balanced international decisions
under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC) which represent meaningful progress in
our global response to climate change.
These agreements advance each of the core elements of the Copenhagen Accord: They anchor the Accord's mitigation
pledges; build on a system of transparency with substantial detail and content of International Consultations and
Analysis which will provide confidence that a country's pledges are being carried out; launch a new Green Climate Fund;
create a framework to reduce deforestation in developing countries; establish a technology mechanism; and Setup a
framework and committee to will promote international cooperation and action on adaptation.
The Cancun Agreements represent a balanced and significant step forward. In the days and months ahead, the United
States will work with our friends and partners to keep the world focused on this urgent challenge and to continue
building on this progress.

loomberg to Publish Editorials
By ,IERE-:EviY PE.TEP.S
Being mayor of New York City would be a large enough platform for just about anyone. But apparently not for Michael R.
The mayor's company, 3loomber,
,3 L.P., said on Wednesday that it would begin publishing editorials across its vast media
enterprise in an effort to broaden the company's influence on national affairs. And though Mr. Bloomberg has an
agreement with the city to have no involvement in the ""day-to-day operations"" of his company, the endeavor, called
Bloomberg View, is intended to channel his personal philosophy and worldview.
""I think it's very important that everyone understands that our editorial page is going to be, for sure, consistent with the
values and beliefs of the founder — even if he happens to be mayor of New York City,"" said Matthew Winkler, the editor in
chief of Bloomberg News. ""I fully expect us in our Bloomberg View always to reflect those values. In fact, I want people to
come away from reading the Bloomberg View infused with those beliefs and values.""
The effort presents a host of conflict-of-interest questions for the mayor. The new venture provides the mayor with yet
another potent communications apparatus — one that carries his name and imprimatur — to sound off on issues that
collide with his job as mayor, his corporate interests and his expanding philanthropic empire.
Bloomberg L.P. executives said they would not shy away from publishing editorials on issues in which Mr. Bloomberg has
a direct interest as mayor, like education, public health and environmental policy. Mr. Winkler said the editorials would not
avoid such issues but would disclose the mayor's involvement when warranted.
Though Mr. Bloomberg will not have a hand in conceiving and writing the editorials, he is likely to offer feedback from time
to time before they are published, Mr. Winkler said.
""I think that there's a very good chance that's going to happen,"" he said, referring to Mr. Bloomberg's occasional
involvement. It is unclear whether that level of involvement is permitted under his agreement with the city to remain at
arm's length from the company.
A spokesman for the mayor, Stu Loeser, said the mayor was allowed limited involvement in his agreement with the city.
""Weighing in from time to time is consistent with his being the majority shareholder of the company he founded,"" he said.
As someone whose presidential ambitions are the source of endless speculation, acquiring the platform of an editorial
page is certain to draw more attention to Mr. Bloomberg's plans. (On Sunday, Mr. Bloomberg ruled out a run for
president.)
The unsigned editorials will appear in all of Bloomberg's online and print media properties — including Bloomberg
Businessweek, Bloomberg.com and the nearly 300,000 financial data terminals leased to Wall Street traders and
businesses around the world. It will be run by two distinguished voices: James P. Rubin, a former assistant secretary of
state under Bill Clinton, and David Shipley, editor of The New York Times Op-Ed page.
Opinion and commentary have not typically been areas of focus for Bloomberg, with its just-the-facts approach. In fact,
the mayor has complained about the corrosive effect of the 24-hour news cycle and overheated political commentary in
the blogosphere.
But company leaders, including Mr. Bloomberg, who has been aware of the project since it was conceived more than two
years ago, saw an opportunity to extend their influence.
For a firm that has made no secret of its ambitions to become the most influential media company in the world, starting an
editorial operation is the latest effort to propel it beyond its core mission as a financial news service.
The notion of media barons using editorials to shape public opinion and policy according to their personal views is an old
one in American journalism. William Randolph Hearst, for example, often wrote front-page editorials for his newspapers.
Mr. Bloomberg, it would seem, is casting himself in that mold, though there are no plans for him to begin writing signed
editorials. For now, he is content letting his trusted deputies speak for him.
""He's accepting and embracing the privilege of a media mogul,"" said David Nasaw, a professor of history at the City
University of New York Graduate Center, who wrote a biography of Hearst. ""This is what we all do. We try to persuade the
rest of the world we are right. Of course we don't have the vehicles to do so. The rich have the vehicles to do so.""
Mr. Winkler said: ""There's a huge opportunity here for Bloomberg L.P. and Bloomberg News to seize the day, literally
seize the day by bringing wisdom to events as they unfold. And one can't always do that with the best result with
reporting.""
""That certainly is a benefit to the founder of the company, the man. But it is also a huge opportunity for Bloomberg, the
company, that it should take advantage of,"" Mr. Winkler added.
Bloomberg L.P. acquired BusinessWeek last year, giving the 29-year-old company a print product with a long legacy of
accomplishment.
Bloomberg is in the midst of an expansion in Washington. With a service called Bloomberg Government, an operation that
will eventually employ 300 journalists and analysts, the company will sell, for $5,700 a year, information about government
services and contracts to lobbyists and others with business interests in the nation's capital.","['New', 'York', 'City', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Bloomberg', 'View', 'Washington']"

The Envoy
Posted by Hendrik Hertzberg
Last night, as I was unlocking my bike on a windswept Greenwich Village sidewalk after leaving a holiday party, a friend
approached, cell phone in hand. A few minutes earlier, she and I had been inside, chatting happily amid the buzz and warmth of
a holiday party. Now she had tears in her eyes. ""Richard Holbrooke died,"" she said.
Notwithstanding the hospital bulletins since he fell ill on Saturday—critical condition, damaged aorta, emergency surgery—this
sudden, awful ending was a shock, because Richard Holbrooke was such an astounding volcano of vitality. Everything about
him was large: his physical size, including the ultimate ""in your face"" face, a face like a Times Square billboard; his buzz-saw
voice, a highly expressive instrument, equally adept at piano (a side-of-the-mouth, gossipy wisecrack, often pleasingly nasty)
and forte (a high-decibel outburst of anger or indignation, almost always calculated for effect); his appetites (for experience, for
danger, for praise, for power, for fun); and his ambitions (for himself, for his beliefs, for the United States, for the world). He
was no doe-eyed peacenik, but as a diplomat he labored long and hard to seek alternatives to war and ways to end particular
wars. He was sentimental about his own unsentimentality, romantic about his own tough-guy realism.
Unlike my tearful informant, who had known Holbrooke as a family friend since she was a little girl, I was acquainted with him
in the casual way of many journalists and editors. He was a peer as well as a ""source,"" a prolific and forceful writer whose
favorite venues, The New Republic and The New Yorker, happened to be the places where I've spent my working life. He was
gregarious and fond of big, splashy black-tie evenings. The last time I saw him was six weeks ago, on November 1st, at the
New York Public Library's ""Literary Lions"" celebration. At the pre-dinner reception, where he would normally have been on
his feet, looming large, he repaired to a folding chair behind a little table and let his wife, Kati Marton, bring the party to him.
At sixty-nine he was tired—that much was obvious—but he was as sharp and voluble as ever. He still had plenty to do.
Not long after Holbrooke achieved his greatest diplomatic triumph by negotiating the 1995 end to the Balkan wars, I asked him
if he liked Warren Zevon's wonderful song ""The Envoy."" He said he'd never heard of it. The next day I sent him a CD. After
that, he mentioned it every single time I've seen him, up to and including that NYPL gala, saying he puts it on, loud, when he
needs a lift. And no wonder: his life was a drama, and he liked it that way.
If the Supreme Court had allowed the votes to be counted in 2000, then the Envoy, almost certainly, would have become the
Secretary of State, and the next decade would have unfolded very differently. As it is, Holbrooke has left a stronger, more
positive, more creative mark on history than all but a few of those who have held that post. He certainly did not die of a broken
heart—Kati Marton saw to that—but it was surely the ghastly, impossible demands of his last, impossible assignment that
brought on the rending of his aorta. He died for his country as surely as any soldier. And his deathbed words may turn out to be
the most important he ever spoke.
